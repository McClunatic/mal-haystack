       "{'documents': [<Document: {'content': \"First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC.\\nI admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing after\\nwatching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers.\\nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f81b7e3717bf00d3586ac982a9b0161e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.\\nOne of the issues at hand seems to be ownership as producers, writers and directors all seem to want the work to be reflective of their style and perception, and in order to stamp their mark on a show they will makes numerous unnecessary changes or additions.\\nAdmittedly there are times when the adaptation supersedes the original work, but more often than not the result is at best a decent anime, and at worst utter twaddle.\\nAnd then there\\'s the other side of the coin, where the anime adaptation sticks to the storyline set out in the original work. Normally one would expect these to be superior works, but in a strange irony this is not always the case. The problem with these types of adaptations is that the original work may not have been very good, or even have a suitable narrative, to begin with, and turning them into anime only seems to exacerbate their inherent flaws.\\nFortunately, the Full Metal Alchemist franchise manages to steer clear  almost all of these pitfalls. The problem is, there are no other anime that have so evenly split the viewing public\\'s opinion between the two versions of the series. Unlike the 2003 adaptation, Brotherhood is a faithful representation of Arakawa Hiromu\\'s hit manga, and while many fans of the franchise laud it as the best thing since sliced bread, there are a number who consider the original anime version to be the superior tale.\\nBut we\\'ll get to that in a bit.\\nMany people will already be familiar with the particulars of the story, and in a very real sense the common perception is well formed. Unfortunately, one of the problems with liking something too much is that one becomes blinded to its flaws, and while Brotherhood has very few noticeable ones where the narrative is concerned, this also serves to make them stand out.\\nThe story is told in a very straight forward, no nonsense manner that is kind of refreshing given the penchant for filler episodes. The issue though, is that the content of the tale is much lighter in tone, much more typically \"shounen\" in its essence, than that of the first adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the undercurrent of obsession amongst the main characters peters out towards the end of the story - a stark contrast to the ending in the first adaptation. Instead, these obsessive behaviours are effectively \"de-humanised\" by pushing them on to the non human characters.\\nThere is a very clear sense that the plot is geared towards a more typical shounen standpoint and mentality, and while the whole still works very well as a story, one does have to wonder if the writers for the first adaptation didn\\'t steal a march on Arakawa. It\\'s possible that she had to change her idea of how the tale should develop because the first anime version took a much darker path than most other shounen franchises.\\nThat said, the ending allows for a degree of catharsis that was missing from the first adaptation, and although there are some broad similarities between the two versions at times, in truth they are as different as chalk and cheese. As an added bonus this series is far less dependent on random comedic moments, and the difference this makes to the flow of the plot is palpable when the two versions are directly compared.\\nOne big advantage that Brotherhood has is that the seven year gap has allowed for improvements in various aspects of production, and it shows in a number of areas. The animation is more fluid than before, although admittedly the difference isn\\'t really obvious at first and only really appears during large scale action set pieces. The character designs will be very familiar to any fan, but are subtly sharper and more defined than in the previous series.\\nInterestingly enough, one of the biggest plus points for Brotherhood is actually its wealth of interesting characters.\\nAs one would expect, a number of the characters from the first adaptation appear in Brotherhood, but there are also several who are notable for their absence as they do no appear in the manga. Instead, a horde of new characters appear throughout the course of the series, many of whom have their own goals, ideals and personalities. Indeed the biggest difference between the two versions is the sheer number of people who all seem to have some impact on the story.\\nFor much of the series Edward and Alphonse Elric behave in a manner that many who have watched the first adaptation will find familiar, and one of the nice things about this is that familiarity is used to very subtly develop the pair into very different characters. The change in their personas happens very gradually, but by the end of Brotherhood one can see just how much growth the pair has undergone.\\nStrangely enough, the most interesting additions to the series are actually Yao Ling and Olivier Mira Armstrong (Alex Louis Armstrong\\'s older sister - but without all the muscle flexing), two of the supporting roles. Yao Ling presents a strange dichotomy for the series to tackle, and while he doesn\\'t develop as much as he possibly could have, this is offset by the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in his situation towards the end of the series. On the other Olivier Armstrong possesses some of the strongest characterisation in the whole story, and while she is without doubt a major player at certain points of the show, what makes her interesting is the fact that the viewer is never quite sure of her goals.\\nThere are a number of very strong characterisations in the series, but one of the things that is a little strange is the difference between the two versions where the homunculi are concerned. Unlike the first adaptation the homunculi in Brotherhood have very different origins, even though they still deal with similar obsessions. This raises an interesting perspective on the series as a whole, and is one of the reasons why Brotherhood is far more of a shounen tale than the original adaptation. The plot takes on a subtly lighter tone, even though it may not seem that way, once their origins are understood, and the main reason for this is the \"de-humanisation\" I mentioned earlier. The viewer is aware that these characters, though human-like in form, are not linked to humans in any way, and this awareness acts as a buffer so the viewer is less likely to question the actions and behaviour of the homunculi. In essence one is subjected to the ethos that monsters are evil and do bad things, which raises some interesting issues where Kimblee, Greed and the military\\'s generals are concerned.\\nThe quality of the acting is possibly the main reason why Brotherhood is able to pull off its feat of developing not only the familiar characters, but also the new additions. Paku Romi and Kugimiya Rie reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, but with the exception of a few roles, the remaining cast are very different from the first outing. Now normally one might consider this a recipe for disaster, but it\\'s a testament to the quality of not only the actor\\'s abilities, but also the scriptwriters, that this series easily stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.\\nThe music is very well composed and produced, and the series has a surprisingly large number of opening and ending themes, especially for 64 episode series. That said, fans of Brotherhood may find themselves in a bit of a quandary, especially if they prefer the OPs and EDs from the first series. As for the sound effects, they are handled in a decidedly competent manner that makes one wonder why other shounen anime seem to have trouble in this department. Granted there are occasions when there\\'s a bit of a cacophony, but in general the effects are clear, bold, and well choreographed.\\nNow unlike most viewers, I actually consider Brotherhood to be equal to the first series, and I don\\'t really fall on one side or another. Like a number of fans my preference is for the much darker tone of the first series, however the cathartic ending of Brotherhood, as well as the improvements in production and animation, go some way to balancing the scales. Some people prefer the somewhat darker nature to Ed\\'s character from the first adaptation, but in all honesty the rationale behind the two versions is very different, and while they\\'re broadly the same character, that perception is only really valid until the last few episodes of either show. The same principle applies to Alphonse, Roy Mustang, in fact to most of the characters.\\nThat said, Brotherhood is just as entertaining and involving as its predecessor, and it\\'s a testament to Arakawa\\'s skill as a mangaka that she has been able to produce a tale that, at the very least, rivals the original anime adaptation.Yes, Brotherhood is more typically shounen than the other version, but the nice thing about this is that fans are given two very good versions of the same story, and that is something rare in anime.\\nNow if only all remakes, revisions or reboots could be this good.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f6dce4a269fe5fc02e9c55892354c10'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I\\'ve seen many fans preach about how \"it lives up to the hype\" and \"can never receive too much praise\". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I\\'m certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That\\'s not to say that I didn\\'t enjoy it or that it\\nisn\\'t a very solid addition to the ranks of notable shows; I really would like to preface this review by saying that I believe that FMA:B is a very good show and I wouldn\\'t be nearly as harsh on it if it weren\\'t for the God status the show has attained in America. I would happily remand \"greatest show ever made\" to \"greatest long-running shonen ever made if you haven\\'t seen the 2011 Hunter X Hunter\"\\nI\\'m not a huge fan of the MAL categorical rating system, as I\\'ve mentioned in some of my previous reviews. I oftentimes outright ignore it. However, looking at the categories right now, I feel as though this is one instance where I can use it to talk about everything I want to so I\\'m going to use it.\\nSTORY: 8\\nThe FMA:B plot and world-building are some of its strongest aspects. The world that it creates is an immersive, full-feeling thing with many animate pieces that move even when you aren\\'t looking at them. It\\'s an extremely creative world as well, adopting its own set of universal laws including alchemy through equivalent exchange, mind-body duality and its own interpretation of a higher power, and it sticks by these laws. Never once does the story contradict its own rules, instead using them in creative ways to build off of each other. The plot is also one of the most engaging parts of the show, unveiling itself at just the right pace to keep you interested whilst still keeping a few major cards to play at the very end. The pieces fall into place in a way that is satisfying because it simultaneously mind-blowing and obvious, and that\\'s one of the marks of strong storytelling.\\nWhile the FMA:B story is certainly one of the best I\\'ve seen, I find that I have to withhold my 10 score here on the grounds that its incredible direction and creativity are marred by some detrimental weaknesses. First of all, the exposition is handled extremely poorly. The first and third episodes feel like they\\'re from some shitty cartoon network show, the show blatantly ignores the show-don\\'t-tell rule in the entirety of its first chunk (with characters spelling out exactly what is happening and why it\\'s happening) and its tendency to repeat important plot points over and over again quite frankly feels insulting to me as the audience as though the show is assuming I\\'m not able to pay attention or figure things out for myself and need to have the fact that Ed and Al committed the sin of human transmutation and lost their bodies told to me at least twenty-five times in the first two hours of show. Secondly, there\\'s a period of time which I would probably refer to as the third fourth of the show (episodes 40-53ish) in which the show drags incredibly, adopting a typical battle-shonen approach of having characters engage in multiple-episode long one-on-one or two-on-one battles, giving them plenty of time to pose and stand off and monologue at each other. This isn\\'t how fighting or war works, and these contrived battles really take away a lot of the climactic atmosphere. Finally, the show\\'s ending is not nearly as satisfying as I wish it had been. The final few episodes are for the most part brilliant, but once the show plays all its cards and it\\'s resolution time, it wraps itself up with cliches and in-your-face themes.\\nART: 8\\nThe art is absolutely astounding 80% of the time and absolutely horrid 20% of the time. Thus the 8 score. The action is all stunning, the openings gorgeous, the backgrounds consistent and unique, building a sense of a real lived-in world. The character designs are sometimes a little bland, but for the most part they are memorable and the homunculi look brilliant so I don\\'t have any real complaints there.\\nWhat I have a problem with is the obnoxious number of times that the show goes \"anime\" - reducing its characters to shittily-drawn caricatures and its animation to blocky, looped motion. Usually this is used during the shows attempts at humor, which I\\'ll talk about later, but most of the time it was just extremely cringe-inducing and distracting, ruining the sense of continuity and immersion in this world. The show obviously wants you to take it seriously (it sure loves its drama) and when Al is portrayed as a big grey mound with a squiggle for a mouth it makes this difficult. There\\'s a difference between having your character goof around and having the show itself goof around. It almost feels like a laugh-track, telling the audience \"this is the funny part!\"\\nFor the most part, however, the art is gorgeous. When it counts, it shines, and that\\'s really what matters.\\nSOUND: 10\\nUndeniably the strongest aspect of the show. I have no complaints whatsoever. The soundtrack is never distracting but always effective, the voice-actors (especially for Bradley and Al) absolutely nailed it and the openings and endings... dear lord. It\\'s been said before, but the openings and endings to FMA:B are some of the very best ever made, both in sound and visuals. They tell small stories of their own. They set the tone for the episode and for their section of the show as a whole. I especially loved \\'Golden Time Lover\\' and \\'Chemistry\\', but I have to give special mention to SID\\'s \\'Rain\\'. As far as I\\'m concerned, that opening could have been the end of the show. It single-handedly established a sense of finality, a long-endured struggle of these characters and their causes. Everyone is portrayed as exhausted, weak and full of both despair and determination: protagonist and antagonist alike, fighting under the rain. Not for glory, not for honor, but just for the one thing they care most for. Personally, it made me extremely hyped for the final stretch of the show. It wasn\\'t quite what we got, but at least we got some of it.\\nI believe that there is an intense connection between a show\\'s opening and the audience\\'s willingness to appreciate it. It is very likely that the intensity of many fanbases is in part due to the ability that openings such as these have to maintain feelings in regards to the show, oftentimes perhaps even distorting or altering memories of the show itself into what the opening would have you believe the show was like rather than what it was actually like. Obvious examples that jump to mind are Sword Art Online\\'s \"Courage\" and Guilty Crown\\'s \"My Dearest\". Remember how those shows were absolutely nothing like that? No?? IT\\'S TOO LATE FOR YOU\\nBut I digress.\\nCHARACTER: 6\\nI would definitely call out the show\\'s characters on being the weakest link and the most undeserving of the praise that the show receives. For starters, the writing is often clunky and awkward, but that\\'s not the main issue. It\\'s because most of them are not really characters: they\\'re plot devices with one or two distinguishing traits tacked on. They\\'re entirely predictable, not because they feel like real people but because they do the same things over and over again. Al talks about what he\\'ll do when he gets his body back. Ed talks about how they\\'ll find a way and how they will atone for their mistakes and etc. It\\'s not that it\\'s melodrama: it\\'s the fact that it\\'s the SAME melodrama over and over again. It wasn\\'t until sometime past episode 30 that Ed stopped sounding perpetually like a broken record and started to feel as though he were actually developing, but even then he was really just defined by his arc and not by any amount of complexity.\\nAnd that\\'s the pitfall that so many of these characters fall into. If your character\\'s only real traits beyond their development for the sake of the show are \"hates being called short\" and \"hates milk\" they\\'re really more of a tool with some googly eyes stuck on to them. Other characters are even worse: Armstrong is manly. His sister is more manly. Mustang wants to be Fuhrer and avenge Hughes (he\\'s even got this great relationship with Hawkeye that could have been seriously compelling if they ever had any real conversations about anything besides \"we must overthrow the government\" and \"Hughes!\" over and over again). Winry likes Ed and automail. Ling wants to be emperor. Now, FMA:B is a complex, busy show. I could understand if it didn\\'t have the time to make these characters anything more than chess pieces for its grand and elaborate plot, giving them a few distinguishing traits because that\\'s really all it can manage without dragging itself out immensely. But it DOES have the time: it has all the time it spends having Ed yell about being called short. It has all the time it spends having Armstrong pull of his shirt and yell about being manly. It has all the time it spends having Ed and Al talk about getting their goddamn bodies back over and fucking over again as though I would somehow manage to forget it. Ling passing out from lack of food. May fawning comically over Ed. Mustang is antisocial LOL. The same gags, over and over again, barely even rehashed in any original way. Not only do they become painful to watch, they devour all of the development that this shallow cast of characters could have had to make me actually invested in them. They\\'re far too static, with most of them having a single change or revelation over the course of the show\\'s 64 episodes in order to indicate that they have grown as a person. But a good character has so much more than that: what kind of music do these people listen to? Why? Who are their role models? Why? What books do they like? What are their favorite places to eat? What do they appreciate in the people they\\'re close to?? What are their personal histories...\\nOh wait, sorry! I didn\\'t mean to ask that last one! Please, I take it back! NOOOOOOO...\\nYeah so I forgot to mention something. Screw all that stuff about making these characters possess complex personalities, FMA:B has a better way to define them.\\nTRAUMA\\nEveryone who\\'s remotely relevant has a traumatic backstory. It\\'s a harsh world, sure. I get that. Here\\'s the issue: people are introduced and then defined through their trauma. Now this isn\\'t Angel Beats bad, where horrible things happen to perfectly innocent people for no reason. Most of the tragedy is partially a result of the decisions of the characters involved, and their resulting struggle is a combination of having to cope with the consequences and with themselves and their mistakes. However, this cannot be used as a SUBSTITUTE for character development. A supplement, sure, but I still remember in episode four when Ed and Al meet a state alchemist who literally introduces himself with something along the lines of \"my wife left me because we were too poor\" before he even tells them his goddamn NAME. Here, come on in! Take a seat! Would you like some sorrow pie or tragic backstory cake? We have plenty! Ed and Al\\'s dad left, then their mom died, then they f*cking ripped their bodies apart. Winry\\'s parents were murdered in cold blood. Mustang had to kill lots of people. Armstrong had to kill lots of people. Everyone had to kill lots of people. Scar watched everyone he loved get killed, and then had to kill lots of people. These are always the first things we find out about people, and then for the rest of the show they are defined almost exclusively by them. If anyone is overly happy and wholesome, it means something horrid is going to happen to them. It\\'s basic emotional manipulation. Look at this adorable little girl and her dog! Dead. Look at this smiling, picturesque family! Husband dead. Dead. Everyone innocuously happy has to die or lose someone close to them. The more broken and internally conflicted you are, the safer you are. There\\'s no need to pile more grief on Scar, so he\\'s relatively safe.\\nYes, the characters suffer from repeatable and preventable problems. They exist mainly to function as morals-in-a-bottle with gags tacked on to them. They\\'re difficult to relate to, because all we know about them is whatever themes they embody and one or two dumb jokes. Ikuhara writes characters more personable than this, and his stories don\\'t make sense on PURPOSE. I did give the characters a 6 though, and there are reasons for that.\\nFirst off, despite their lack of humanization the characters complete their tasks of being walking themes with relative effectiveness. This isn\\'t anywhere near Log Horizon S1 bad. These characters are here for a reason, they represent something, and they represent those things well. Sure, they could have easily been better, but they fulfill their purpose and for that alone they are not failures. I will also give special mention to Scar, who, while still actively defined by his trauma was executed far more impressively than the other characters. This is probably in part because the show actually viewed him as morally ambiguous as opposed to just making the character FEEL morally ambiguous when there was really no doubt that the show wanted you to think this was a \\'good guy\\' (*cough* Mustang)\\nSecond off, there are some exceptions to the rule. Most of my complaints thusfar have been leveled at the shows protagonists. They are the ones that suffer from dismal repetition and blatant violation of show-don\\'t-tell. Where the show does excel is with its antagonists. There are seven homunculi in the show, incarnations of the seven deadly sins, and they so utterly clobber their \"good-guy\" counterparts in terms of being engaging, personable subtle characters that it isn\\'t even funny. Their intensive backstories are never shoved in your face, their apparent contradictions are given plenty of time to be uncovered by the viewer, and the deliciously ironic conclusions to their arcs are done tactfully. Many times I found myself actively routing for them because they were just so much more interesting and well-executed. I would happily watch an \"Adventures of the Homunculus\" spinoff cataloging the several hundred years most of them lived before the start of the series.\\nENJOYMENT: 7\\nI was constantly gripped by the plot. I actively looked forward to the openings and endings. The art was oftentimes orgasmic. The homunculi made me want to start looking for ingredients to make a philosopher\\'s stone with. However, I was constantly frustrated by the show\\'s apparent lack of respect for its viewers and by its absolutely abysmal humor. I\\'ve already said it, but I don\\'t know if I\\'ve driven home just how infuriating it is to have exposition repeated to you over and f*cking over again and how cringe-inducing it is when somebody violates the show-don\\'t-tell rule at extremely tense and crucial moments. It actively snapped me out of the experience whenever Ed and Al had a conversation about getting their bodies back after the 5th time it happened, and when God literally spelled out for Ed that he had discovered the meaning of life I facepalmed hard. That\\'s not how you do themes, man. That just comes off as preachy. That\\'s something the show suffered constantly from: it felt incredibly preachy. It\\'s character\\'s speeches about the answers they had found to their struggles felt much more pointed at the audience than at anyone in the show they were talking to, and that bothered the ever-loving crap out of me. And have I mentioned the humor? For every joke the show has that lands, it tries about five others that fall on their face. As I\\'ve already mentioned, they\\'re repetitive and used as a substitute for meaningful character interactions and development. It seems as thought the show is trying to use them as a counterbalance for its immense amount of melodrama, but instead they end up just ripping apart the tone and stagnating the story. Despite these gripes, I did overall enjoy the experience and felt that the positives did inevitably outweigh the negatives so I will happily give it a 7 for enjoyment.\\nOVERALL: 7\\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is not a masterpiece. It\\'s a very respectable, unique, inspired and creative show and it\\'s definitely a classic. I would happily recommend this to most people. However, don\\'t go in with irrational expectations. It\\'s enjoyable, it\\'s engaging, it will definitely give you plenty to think about, but in my personal opinion it gets a little too much praise and a little too much hype. I probably would have enjoyed it more myself if I hadn\\'t heard nothing but angelic worship for it before going into it. I formally apologize to any huge fans of the show that I may have offended: it\\'s not by any means a bad show! I don\\'t give out 7s all that lightly, believe me. This is merely an argument against FMA:B being the be-all-end-all of anime.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Overview:\\nFMA Brotherhood is an anime that needs no introduction. This is the highest rated anime on all of MAL. This is the anime that the current generation of anime fans holds above all others as the greatest single anime EVER made! In the following paragraphs, I will be reviewing this legendary series and discussing whether or not it truly deserves this title.\\nSPOILERS for both Brotherhood and 2003 FMA!!!!\\nPlot:\\nThe plot takes place in the country of Armestris, which is basically like an alternate WW2 Germany. It is constantly at war for reasons that are less than just and is ruled by a rather nefarious government.\\nWhat makes this world special is that alchemy is the primary science instead of the much less fun and flashy science of our own reality. Alchemy allows practitioners to transmute material into other useful material, and basically do all kinds of awesome stuff! Our heroes are the Elric brothers, who wish to find the legendary Philosopher\\'s Stone and gain back their original bodies that they lost in a forbidden alchemy ritual gone horribly wrong. In order to search for the stone, they join the military. Unfortunately this means they have to serve under a rather evil government and face strong moral dilemmas. The Elric brothers don\\'t wish to take part in the government\\'s genocidal campaigns, but they need the military in order to accomplish their own personal goals. Of course, things are a bit more complicated by the fact that many in the military are actually good people and are either unaware of just how bad the government is, or feel remorse for their crimes and  wish to change the government. This is refreshing for a shonen series in which \"good and evil\" is too often clear cut. We have all seen Hollywood movies where the German Army is filled with nothing but pure evil monsters with zero humanity. As a side note, eventually Hollywood got MUCH better with treating the Germans this way... thanks to us ethnic Germans making up 40% of the US population, but Hollywood STILL treats the Russians and certain other groups this way!\\nEventually, the Elric brothers uncover the frightening truth that the real leader behind the government is an ancient evil being called \"Father\" who uses his homunculus minions to due his bidding and wishes for ultimate knowledge and power! The Elric brothers also make many allies on their adventures including Scar, the Xingese, and Hohenheim, who all contribute in the fight against Father. The plot ultimately concludes with a very happy ending, which pleased fans far more than the bittersweet ending of the 2003 anime. It should also be noted that unlike the plot of the 2003 anime, FMA Brotherhood mostly stays faithful the Hiromu Arakawa\\'s original manga.\\nDifferences between 2003 FMA and Brotherhood:\\nAlthough there are many differences in the plot which I will get to, the most immediately obvious difference is in the tone of the series\\' narrative. The 2003 FMA has a VERY dark and somber tone throughout the series, which makes it really stand out as the oddball of the shonen world. FMA Brotherhood has tragic moments, but they are balanced out with zany comedy, more happy endings, and less emotional suffering in general. The tone in Brotherhood actually feels like you are watching a shonen anime like Naruto or One Piece. You know going in that there will be sad parts, but all will turn out well in the end. FMA 2003 feels closer to watching Berserk than it does to watching Naruto or One Piece! Whether a viewer prefers lighthearted shonen or brooding seinen is a matter of taste, but let us take a look at the subject matter being dealt with in this series. In both the 2003 FMA and Brotherhood, this is a series about German soldiers serving a genocidal regime and ultimately having to rebel against the government and try atone for their crimes. Does that sound like something that should be a fun, zany comedy? \"It is almost certain that we will fail. But how will future history judge the German people if not even a handful of men had the courage to put an end to that criminal?\" - Henning Von Tresckow. I can ASSURE you he didn\\'t tell a stupid joke 20 seconds afterwards so that his listeners wouldn\\'t feel sad about the deaths of 17 million civilians murdered by the Nazis as \"untermenschen\". Was the movie Das Boot a fun comedy? NO! Have you ever wondered why that is? The reason is that making a movie or series about German soldiers reflecting on mass genocide into a delightful romp is fucking stupid as hell! To think that people on MAL accuse Elfen Lied of having bad tone whiplash. FMA Brotherhood thematically achieves a mood whiplash other anime can only dream of.\\nNow we get to characters and plot differences. Firstly, lets talk about everyone\\'s favorite FMA character, Roy Mustang. In FMA 2003, Roy is the one who murdered Winry\\'s parents instead of Scar. Roy is also MUCH more affected by his guilt for having murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in the name of an evil government. In 2003 FMA, Roy actually tries to kill himself in a state of deep depression, but Hughes stops him and instead inspires him to live, so that one day he can overthrow and lead the government. Roy actually manages to kill Fuhrer Bradley and do what he had dreamed of for so long. However, he is too overwhelmed by the emotional stress to simply stay in the military and take a role of leadership like he does in Brotherhood. Roy retires to a simple life with Hawkeye instead and only uses his alchemy again in the movie Conquerors of Shamballa to save the people of Central. Roy is a MUCH more empathetic and truly human character in the original 2003 series. He is actually, truly effected by guilt and stress the way a real person that isn\\'t a total sociopath would be. He doesn\\'t just feel kind of bad for about 5 minutes, then move on. \"I killed those people under orders, I don\\'t have to REALLY feel too bad about it.\" If the point is to make Roy a true military hero that reveals the full horrors of war and shows how even good men will commit evil deeds under orders, then the 2003 anime accomplishes this a LOT better than Brotherhood did!\\nNow let\\'s look at the Arab anti-hero Scar. In both series, Scar is a survivor of the Ishvalan genocide who is consumed with the desire for vengeance against the State Alchemists that slaughtered his people. In both series, Scar has an elder brother who violated Scar\\'s Ishvalan religion and practiced alchemy, ultimately saving his life and giving him his special arm. However, in the 2003 anime we learn that Scar\\'s brother violated a FAR more sacred law and tried to resurrect his dead lover with alchemy. This was of course a miserable failure that drove his brother mad with grief and furthered Scar\\'s hatred of alchemy. This works better in terms of narrative, because it gives Scar even more reason to hate alchemy as violently as he does and view it as \"false\". It also better explains why Scar sympathized with Edward Elric, because he could tell he had lost his limbs in a human transmutation and was reminded of his own brother. In terms of objective \"writing 101\" and constructing a narrative, this extra back story from the 2003 anime was brilliant and felt far more complete than Brotherhood. Scar\\'s end is also WAY better in the original 2003 anime. In Brotherhood, Scar fights his ultimate battle against Wrath, who was only the 3rd strongest homunculi, not the real mastermind behind the Ishvalan genocide, and had no real connection to Scar since they had never met. In the 2003 series, Scar fights his ultimate battle against the pure evil State Alchemist Zolf Kimblee, who murdered his brother and gave him his namesake scar. Which of these makes sense in terms of basic storytelling? Having a character\\'s big fight be against a personal opponent where the struggle actually MEANS something, or have the fight be against a barely connected random character? It is sad that Scar has to die in the 2003 series, but his death is a heroic one and ultimately a much better written conclusion to his story. In Brotherhood, Scar somehow survives in order for a happier ending and we get a quick cameo of him working to rebuild Ishval. Scar is a flawed anti-hero consumed with a desire for revenge. In the original series, his tragic and heroic death makes the audience care a LOT more about him than Brotherhood does. Would it have been good storytelling in Lord of the Rings if Boromir for some reason survived, then we get a quick 2 sentences about how he is living happily in Gondor after the war? No. That would be really stupid and Tolkien being a good writer, realized that and gave Boromir a heroic death of penance that better closed his story.\\nThere are WAY too many examples, so we will make our final one a comparison between Dante and Father. How can I even compare them? You are probably thinking right now. \"Dante is just a forgettable Filler Villain and Father is one of the greatest villains in anime history!\" The truth is that Father...isn\\'t actually a very good villain. Remember that this is a story about an alternate WW2 Germany and a group of soldiers fighting against an evil government following a massive genocide. Adolf Hitler was not a nice man, but he WAS a human being. Dante is powerful, but ultimately just an ordinary human sociopath who wishes to sacrifice countless people she views as inferior to guarantee her own Godhood and immortality. I think that sounds a LOT closer to Hitler than a fucking ink blot genie from Ancient Persia looking for ultimate knowledge. If you are going to tell a story with OBVIOUS real world parallels, then STAY CONSISTENT! Government atrocities and genocides happen due to ordinary human leaders with extremely selfish desires, NOT evil genies! The Holocaust, Cambodian Genocide, Rwandan Genocide, and Armenian Genocide were not caused by Mr. Popo!!!\\nAnimation:\\nFMA Brotherhood is a very well animated series and admittedly does look better in most places than the 2003 original. Is the animation enough to give it the title of greatest of all time? No.\\nSoundtrack:\\nThe soundtrack for FMA Brotherhood is once again quite solid, but isn\\'t even as good as the 2003 FMA OST, let alone worthy of the greatest of all time title! Just compare the main theme from the Brotherhood OST to the main theme Bratja from 2003 FMA. The main theme for Brotherhood is a fairly bland orchestral piece with some ominous chanting that sounds like a throw away extra from the Hellsing Ultimate soundtrack. The main theme from the 2003 FMA is a heartbreaking, beautiful song about an elder brother asking forgiveness from his younger brother. Bratja is WAY better than anything in Brotherhood without question! Compare the first opening theme of Brotherhood to the 1st opening of the 2003 series. The 2003 series has Ready Steady Go, one of the greatest openings in the history of anime. Brotherhood has an extremely forgettable opening that wouldn\\'t rank in the top 500 anime openings.\\nOverall:\\nFMA Brotherhood is a good anime overall, but it is ONLY a good anime. It isn\\'t anywhere NEAR the greatest anime ever made! It is actually vastly inferior to the original 2003 FMA and even that wasn\\'t the single greatest anime of all time, although a MUCH better candidate than Brotherhood. Of course the title of G.O.A.T. is a highly subjective and debatable matter, but there isn\\'t a single category where Brotherhood REALLY outshines its competitors. Some people say Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest of all time. I\\'m not going to say that LOTGH is an absolutely flawless work, because it isn\\'t. However, it actually stays consistent in its tone with the heavy ideas and themes it presents. Brotherhood does not. Brotherhood is WAY closer to Elfen Lied than LOTGH in terms of keeping a consistent tone  to respect very dark and serious subject matters. LOTGH has an absolutely EPIC scope with hundreds of well written characters, maybe the most intricate politics in all of anime, and gets viewers to really think about real world problems and issues in terms of government, better than any other anime ever made. In other words, LOTGH actually DOES have areas where it clearly outshines its peers and therefore has a far more legitimate claim to the throne. Cowboy Bebop has almost without question the greatest original OST in anime history, is more accessible to non-anime fans than any other anime, and is an absolute blast from beginning to end. Once again, it has areas where it is clearly the best, so a more legitimate claim. Name just ONE thing that Brotherhood is the best at? Most tearjerking? nope. Best written? not even close. Most philosophical and complex? Hell no. Best art? nope. Best soundtrack? nope. It is solid around the board, but it isn\\'t actually truly great at anything! I would therefore argue that Brotherhood is NOT the greatest of all time, is INSANELY overrated, and you are honestly much better off watching the 2003 FMA.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Since I couldn\\'t find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review:\\nHere\\'s why FMA:B and it\\'s Manga counterpart don\\'t work:\\nIt\\'s just a disjointed piece of art. The initial premise of the narrative: two young siblings that horrifically lose their mother and parts of themselves is incredibly dark and powerfully poignant. Their journey to find the philosophers stone is one that\\'s objectively adventurous but the endpoint is still inherently adult and sophisticatedly gritty; especially as it delves into the implications of bringing a dead person back to life early on in the series.\\nSo why is it disjointed?\\nBecause there\\'s a mistranslation of tonal nuance throughout the entire series. Now I don\\'t mean stylistic aspects such as art style choices e.g. Chibi segments (because those are minuscule details in the grand scheme of storytelling devices), but rather the way they\\'re implemented in the story. For example, one second we\\'re dealing with the introspective reconciliation of human birth and how beautiful it is and the very next we drop it for side-gags just to transition into the next topic/character development. It just doesn\\'t fit. It\\'s formulaic. It\\'s predictable storytelling at it\\'s finest and it absolutely ruins the pacing.\\nIt\\'s a huge shame because the character development and dialogue in the series is exquisitely written (some of the best in any story I\\'ve ever seen); e.g. Edward\\'s speech about his existential crisis provided a deep psychoanalytical view into his personality and character. This is amazing character development! However it actually lessens the impact of the narrative and my personal enjoyment of the series because it contrasts heavily with the tone of the series. Right down to the very commercial transitions with the quirky voice-over of the title; every little stylistic choice is presented as a complete antithesis to the themes of the series.\\nFullmetal Alchemist should NOT be sugarcoated with a light-hearted aesthetic. This is something I\\'d hate to say in any other series because pretentiously \"dark and gritty\" series (*cough* Tokyo Ghoul *cough*) are the bane of my existence but this is the one exception. If the themes of the series are of complex adult issues, why is the tone appealing to childish humour and zany adventurous antics?\\nWith all that being said, I totally understand why Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is considered one of the greatest Animes of all time because it is substantially provocative and extremely complex behind the aesthetics much like many other great Animes like One Piece, Hunter X Hunger, Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball.\\nPersonally, it just doesn\\'t work from a narrative perspective because it feels disjointed and unfocused in the way it clashes with stylistic ambiguity. Through this loss of tone, the series becomes a chain of loose threads that are vaguely commentating on the overall themes of the narrative which is why I rated Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Manga: 5/10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8e70fb9c3131c94732c3033256b0558e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.\\nThis anime starts off at a breakneck pace.  It shoots entire volumes of the manga in a couple\\nof episodes.  It was to be expected though, as Bones is trying to fit 100+ chapters of manga into a 1-year long series.  However, once you get used to it the pacing seems very appropriate for the series and only seems to increase the suspense.  While small elements have been omitted from the manga, these are mainly non-essential and have no impact on the story.  Yet while many of these omitted elements are comedic in nature, Brotherhood still manages to switch between seriousness and comedy so fast you\\'ll get whiplash.  I quite enjoyed this particularly as a sort of trademark of the series.  The actual plot-line twists and turns in unexpected ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the climax grips you like no other.  Many disregard the plot as being generically shonen, but it is these twists and its exploration into the psyche and motivation of the characters that propel it past this \"generic shonen\" label.\\nThe art is of a different style to the original FMA.  It is a little simpler, and comedic scenes sometimes even stray into an outright chibi style, but this is by no means a bad thing.  If anything it is closer to the the style that Hiromu Arakawa draws with in the manga.  What its lacking in detail, it makes up for with first-class fight sequences (as to be expected of Bones).  The animation overall is quite polished and character movements are very fluid and natural.\\nThe characters on both sides really caught my attention as one of this series\\' strengths.  It boasts a diverse range of characters, all of which have considerable substance and a distinct purpose in the storyline.  The Homunculi especially turn out to be completely different from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and more awesome in my opinion.  Edward and Alphonse are still the main focus of the story as they quest to find the Philosophers\\' Stone and restore their bodies, but now Winry also takes a more central role along with Ed and Al\\'s father, Hohenheim.  There is also a host of new characters which didn\\'t feature in the first anime adaptation, including a few from the mysterious country Xing and a new main villain.  Being completely faithful to the manga, all the characters\\' separate journeys and origins are told in much greater detail.  Each character\\'s values and beliefs are tested almost to breaking point as the story reaches its later stages, providing a somewhat surprising and refreshing depth to the cast.\\nThe one thing I initially disliked about this series was the soundtrack, which lacked substance and was very repetitive.  The first opening was brilliant, one of the best I have seen, but the background music was lacklustre.  However, as the series went on more music was added and the soundtrack began to add a great atmosphere to fight scenes and dialogue alike.  The voice actors also really show their ability throughout the series and seem very well suited to their roles.  With such an all-star cast of voice-actors you wouldn\\'t expect any less.\\nOverall Bones has done an awesome job surpassing its previous effort and faithfully retelling the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.  Enjoyment wise, you\\'d be hard pressed to find a shonen anime that will entertain you as much as FMA Brotherhood.  Truly a great anime, there\\'s no other way to describe it.  A must-see for people new to anime and hardened otakus alike.

We can\\'t even save a little girl, so what good are we?\"-Edward Elric\\nNow let\\'s talk about the best rated show on this website. Ever since its release, fans and critics alike have a mixed reaction to the show. Some of them say that the original show is better while others say this is better. I can\\'t see why we can\\'t like both. They each have things that really work about them. I think they are both masterpieces on a entertainment and artistic level. Some moments in the show will make you laugh, then the next question life, and then\\ncry your eyes out. Some moments in the show are just plain beautiful from the characters, animation, and the really touching moments. There are moments were some of the characters you get attached to die. (Not going to tell what characters because of spoilers, obviously.) A character will get super depressed, and one even almost goes insane. All of these characters express real human emotions unlike some other anime which they express one key emotion. The emotional scenes aren\\'t forced, they have a really big impact on you as a person. You\\'ll start to relate to every character and even question life. Some examples being \"What is the truth?\" or \"Could humans play the role of god?\" That\\'s why I love this show so much. You\\'ll start to look at the world in a different perspective after you watch this and the original show. Now shall we get to the review?\\nStory 10/10 Standout(s) The fantastic end to the series\\nIf you want to know my original thoughts of the story, read my review of the original show. Anyway the end to this anime is one of the best endings I\\'ve ever seen in an anime. It was very beautiful and touching. This review is suppose to be spoiler free (In most cases.) So I can\\'t tell you my thoughts of the ending. If you want more in detail of the ending, just ask me. Anyway, I can\\'t talk about much about the story without repeating myself, so let\\'s go to the art and animation.\\nArt and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation\\nYou can tell that they had a huge budget just by looking at a character. It was very solid and very easy on the eyes. This really shines in the well animated action scenes. They were just plain epic! What I didn\\'t explain in full detail in my review of the original was the character designs. I didn\\'t give enough praise for them, I just said they were creative and expressive, that was it. You can tell which character is who at first glance. That\\'s a really hard thing to do for a 64 episode anime, but this show pulls it off very well. The character\\'s have there own unique features that stand out among the rest. Now let\\'s go to the sound.\\nSound 10/10 Standout(s) The dub\\nThe soundtrack really fit in with the anime. I mostly loved the music they played in the action scenes or when there was something bad going on. I found it very unique and weirdly fit with the tension of a scene. For the dub, most people consider it one of the best dubs out there and I don\\'t blame them. The only difference between the dub for the original and the dub for this was Al\\'s actor. Al\\'s original actor, Aaron Dismuke, had too deep of a voice to play Al anymore. So they got Maxey Whitehead to play him. So was Maxey good as Al? She did a fantastic job in my eyes. When I saw the first episode, I thought that was the original actor. That\\'s how good her performance was. If you want me to go in depth about the dub, read my review of the original. Now the one you\\'ve all been waiting for, the characters.\\nCharacters 10/10 Standout(s) Every single one of them\\nThis is my favorite character cast in any anime. They were all very entertaining in their own little way. If you want to hear me talk about Ed and Al, read my review of the original show. Let\\'s just talk about Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes.\\nRoy Mustang:\\nOn the outside, Roy seems like the calm, collected, and cool guy. On the inside he values the lives of his comrades like Riza Hawkeye and Maes Hughes. If one of them were to die, he would just be sad for the rest of his life. He also has a temper that sometimes gets the best of him. This is a guy you don\\'t want to mess with. He\\'ll burn you to death with his flame alchemy. What makes Roy such a good character is that he\\'ll protect those he values with all his heart. He does have a few weaknesses too, you can\\'t have a good character without his or her faults. Like I said, his temper and the fact that if you were to kill one of his friends, he would vow to kill you no matter what and won\\'t forgive you. He doesn\\'t forgive his enemies that easily. Overall, Roy is defiantly one of the best characters in this anime.\\nMaes Hughes:\\nHughes may seem like the comic relief when you first meet him, but he has more of a personality then that. He is kind, outgoing, and an overall funny person! It\\'s kind of weird how him and Roy get along so well. Hughes is more fun and loud while Roy is more calm and collected. He loves so many people and almost doesn\\'t hate anyone. He loves his daughter and his wife. There\\'s even a few jokes about them in some of the episodes. It feels like his family is the military, his real family, and the Elric brothers. He made a huge impact on the audience for reasons I won\\'t spoil. Overall, a fun guy and a great character!\\nEnjoyment 10/10\\nPeople who will love this show: Everyone, especially fans of the manga.\\nPeople who won\\'t like this show: I don\\'t know who wouldn\\'t like this.\\nOverall 10/10\\nPositives: Everything\\nNegatives: None\\nThis is defiantly one of the best animated shows of all time. It\\'s amazing how many things you\\'ll learn in this anime. It taught me all sorts of things about life. I am in love with this series. Great anime and deserves a 10 from everyone.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"This review is only meant for those who haven't seen the original anime version of Fullmetal Alchemist.\\nWhat can I say about this show? I never even tried to follow the original anime.. I knew it was a big success and has a lot of followers everywhere. But it just didn't catch onto me like it did with so many others. With this renewed version, which follows the manga storyline a lot more precise than the first version, the team behind FMA: Brotherhood did a fantastic job.\\nThe characters are instantly attractive.. what I mean with that is they are very well portrayed as people,\\nunlike so many other anime shows. The story is also instantly compelling.. it drops you right into the world of FMA and does a thorough job of explaining to you how things work. And as far as I've seen, the story never gets repetitive or old. As soon as you finish one episode.. you'll force yourself to watch the next.\\nThe voice actors are another major plus. The sheer talent of many of them is just unbelievable. I especially liked the fact that the voice actor who did (among others) Kira/Yagami Light's voice in Death Note, Mamoru Miyano. Does the voice for Ling Yao, which makes his character even more intriguing.\\nIf FMA Brotherhood keeps up this kind of pace, quality and plot development, then I'm definitely going to add it to my 'All-time-favourite-anime' list.\\nA must see!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '450755f808f836d8190c99eead664240'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.\\nBrotherhood follows the adventures of brothers Edward and Alphonse elric , who have commited taboo and tried to transmutate their mother back from the dead. As a result alphonse is left without his body and stuck to a metal armor and ed with a metal arm and a leg  thus the nickname fullmetal. Thus the two brothers embark on a quest to find the famous philosopher's Stone that is said\\nto allow alchemists to ignore the law of equivalent exchange and help them get their bodies back. I will not go into more details because it will spoil the wonderfull story of the anime. Anyway let's get started.\\nAs opposed to it's 2003 counterpart  Brotherhood does not have filler episodes or sidestories, the manga being almost finished at the time the anime started. There were a few ovas and specials that came out towards the animes end or after it had finished but I am not counting those.But I have to say they managed to strike a perfect balance. Since it had all the source material it needed the anime does not feel stale,I think it goes on  at a great pace  and it manages to strike a perfect balance between fights, serious moments, light hearted ones . But if you are a big fan of the 2003 anime you might find this a bit too fast as some of the characters lack the development they had in the first series and you might not feel as attached to them as you were back then. Though personally I loved the pacing, as I never got bored and I got entangled in a wonderfull story that just kept dragging me in.\\nThe art has greatly improved over its predecessor and even now it's way above your usual animes. The facial expressions are great and the battles, oh man they are going to give you a boner, even if you're a girl. Trust me. Though some people might be set off a bit by the fact that the animation style seems to change from battle to battle, but I think that increases it's quality as very rarely you will have the same two characters battling each-other thus each battle seems unique and fresh. I especially enjoy the ones that involve Wrath as man he is a beast.\\nThe sound is great. I have watched the anime in jappanese thus that is the sound version I shall review.Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonnes and deliver a top quallity performance yet again, but the rest of the cast is not going to let you down either as you can feel they actually enjoy voice acting these characters and that they give their all in their performance. Also I swear to god all the openings and endings are epic. I have all those songs on my playlist at the moment since god they are awesome and fit the show perfectly.\\nI also like the fact they Brotherhood doesn't do something a lot of anime do and by that I mean they do not spoil what will happen in the anime with the intro or outro because they are all custom made and not just scenes picked up from the anime to show off.\\nNow the greatest strength of the anime are its characters. The original series mostly explored just the two protagonists Edward and Al, but brotherhood manages to show off almost any character they introduce, their motives and their dreams. For example Roy Mustang and his dream to become the next Fuhrer to protect all his comrades or scar's dream first of revenge and later of change. As I said earlier some might characters might feel a bit rushed because of the fast pace of the anime (I'm looking at you hughes and nina) but I assure you it does not draw back from the story one bit as they still somehow fullfill their role.\\nThe anime lacks a bit in the replay value, as you wil already know all the big reveals which will probably detract a little from the overall enjoyment  for some, but I watched it multiple times (around once every one and a half years) and I found it refreshing most of the time.\\nAlso if you want to watch the 2003 series you should do it before you watch Brotherhood for one simple reason. The 2003 anime is also a very solid addition to one's library but Brotherhood is the superior version in all areas and you might not enjoy the 2003 version as much if you watch it after brotherhood. Though if you watch the new series after the 2003 one you will definetly still enjoy it as much, if not even more,  as opposed to watching it first.\\nOverall this will always be one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever watched, excelling in all areas with a very compelling story line, complex characters, astonishing art and epic soundtracks. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch it right now, it is a classic and a must see for any anime enthusiast out there.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5cd7f8cd4a8eed48bf06591695fdb649'}>,\n",

FMA Brotherhood has been popping up in Best Anime Lists on Youtube so it piqued my interest.\\nIt follows, or rather it is more parallel with the story in the manga. The art and animation is magnificent, it stayed true to the characters' design but there was a more polished look. The fluidity of the movements during fight scenes are also a feast for the eyes.\\nI could not find a single flaw in this series (except I that I wanted\\nmore episodes). The characters were all wonderfully written. It's hard to create secondary characters that are as strong as the main ones when it comes to viewers' attachments.\\nI found myself falling in love with these amazing characters while I was watching FMAB.

(Like a sledge hammer to the heart)\\nAnd the story, it's hard to find words to describe FMAB's story. The only thing I can think of is that it's magnificent.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"I'll start this by saying that despite being an adamant fan of Fullmetal Alchemist for a couple of years now, I've never managed to finish the first anime series. I've remained caught up with the manga as much as possible, however, and I'm very excited at where this series is going to go.\\nFullmetal Alchemist, as I'm sure you know, is the story of the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Their story begins a number of years before the actual start of the series, with the tragic death of the boys' mother. Edward and Alphonse, child prodigy alchemists at the time, form a pact to resurrect\\nher. Extensive alchemical training finally culminates in the most important experiment of their lives; the forbidden practice of Necromancy. But something goes wrong.\\nEdward is forced to stare in horror as his brother is decomposed before his eyes. He is then whisked away to a mysterious location, where a strange entity reveals to him what the experiment lacked; the Philosopher's Stone. Edward is then returned to his home, where he discovers his brother still missing and his own leg gone. In an act of desperation, he sacrifices his own arm in order to preserve his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Events thereafter eventually culminate in a new mission for the Elrics; to procure the Philosopher's Stone and use it to recreate their own bodies.\\nSounds like heavy stuff, right?\\nOne of the best things about this series is that it manages to provide some great humor that actually fits quite nicely into its overall dark premise. There are some definite lighthearted moments, but never at the cost of plot, and they never take away from the genuinely touching or tragic scenes. The story itself is very enjoyable, and tends to explore some very deep themes, such as the ethics of resurrecting the dead and the effects of war on individuals and societies.\\nStoryline aside, this series is visually stunning. Every cell of animation is detailed enough to almost seem like live action, and the characters themselves, based closely on manga author Hiromu Arakawa's original designs, are positively beautiful in motion. Some may be slightly bothered by the atypical face structures, but I find that they range between unnoticeable and and an improvement over the original series'. The movement is fluid and natural to the point that the opening alone should be enough for any animation enthusiast to be satisfied.\\nCharacters are very entertaining. The very best, as I can assure you from following the manga, are a bit down the road, but the cast as of two episodes in are more than enough to tide anyone over. Roy Mustang is the perfect blend of snarky and serious, with a bit of eccentricity thrown in that any fans of the original anime series should be well familiar with (Tiny Miniskirts will almost assuredly make an appearance in this series once more,) and Edward Elric's familiar short temper, large ego, comedic frustration and occasional moments of genuine caring blend together in what is shaping up to be even better than last time.\\nOne interesting thing about this series is the very first episode. It chronicles the events of an incident in central involving Isaac McDougal, a State Alchemist turned rebel after the Ishbal War, also known as Isaac the Freezer for his water-based alchemy specialty. This was never a part of the original Manga, and indeed only invented to keep audiences from experiencing Deja Vu from the first series. However, it is of such high quality and entertainment value that calling it filler would be downright unfair. It sets the stage for the rest of the series wonderfully and lets you know right away that you're in for a wild ride.\\nIn short, this is a series to stick with. It's already fantastic, and I can assure those of you who have never read the manga that it only goes up from here.

The length (64 episodes) allows for steady character development, whether it be for the better or worse. Even the villains have some sort of depth without making it seem like a rushed pity backstory.

He doesn\\'t have to eat or sleep and is almost immortal. (though arguable since it was mentioned that there is a possibility that the armor would reject his soul eventually.) Link \"naive\" to his actual physicality. His main vulnerability is still an internal idea---the seal transcribed within his metal body. The only problem with the character is the lack of focus on his own thoughts and so on. The lack of exploration in his psychology. There was one episode that showed Al\\'s doubt of his own existence, but this wasn\\'t clearly detailed enough.\\nB. Plot***\\nNot much to say here. Mother dies. They become state alchemist. Look for philosopher\\'s stone. (How are they even allowed the time?) *They meet homunculus. They save everyone from homunculus at the same time they get their bodies back. That\\'s it. They should\\'ve at least included Lin\\'s \"chinese struggle\" and absorbed the surrounding nations within the plot.*\\nC. Setting\\nAutomails? Interesting idea. Problem: Detail, no elaboration.\\nHow many nations were there? I only remember desert, snow, and the rest of the dullness. Where is the economy?\\nAlchemy. The main idea of the show. Quite elaborate in terms of \"the gate\", \"immortality\", and other plot-devices. Problem: How much variety of alchemy did Ed and Al actually use? Move rocks and move more rocks. Mustang did fire tricks. Where are the complicated algorithms? The \"super moves\"? The classification of alchemy? There were mentions of \"eastern alchemy\", \"western alchemy\"; \"comprehension, deconstruction, reconstruction\"; \"equal exchange\" but these things weren\\'t sufficiently fused and utilized as a basis for a unique battle system. sigh.\\n2. Progress***\\n***Ok. What happened again? They walk everywhere and found out that what they were looking for was right beneath their city and that it\\'s sourced out of human souls? How did they change physically and mentally? ***\\nA. Character Development\\nHow much did Ed grow? How much did his personality go from A to B? How much did his height go from A to B? Ask yourself.\\nHow much did Al grow? After experiencing all those moments, you\\'d think they\\'d have a more bad-ass versions of themselves...\\nI mean at least change the character\\'s appearances. Transmute Al\\'s armor into some flexible form or cut Ed\\'s hair.\\nB. Plot Development\\nWhen I said I already knew the outcome after 3-4 episodes, I wasn\\'t kidding. Maybe that\\'s exactly why I felt there wasn\\'t much change. These \"homunculus\" just won\\'t die. They keep coming back and it\\'s like a show of power-puff girls where the girls continuously fight their arch-nemesis\\'s. And don\\'t even get me started on the shallowness of the homunculus\\'. (though I particularly liked Envy and his end.) Almost nothing, aside from what was already known, was happening. They found out about city\\'s secret and they go back to their traveling and meeting new friends and then they go back traveling and finally they decided to finish the job.\\nC. Shift of Setting\\nI guess I shouldn\\'t have expected One Piece. There were some interesting places such as the destroyed kingdom or the northern camp but almost everything happened in the same region.\\n3. Novelty\\nAlchemy and Automail(Shounen) is an interesting combination. If I hadn\\'t watched the first anime, It wouldn\\'t better. Not really. They give you interesting general ideas and they stop there. More details would have produced more novelty. Character-wise, the two had too normal personalities. Interestingly enough, the flashbacks had a more novel point of view than the original.\\nA. Characters\\nWhat would have really gotten well was if their circumstances actually shaped a plenty of their personalities. The loss body parts didn\\'t serve much meaning in terms of their character build up. What I saw was stubborn kid and naive brother. How swell...\\nB. Setting\\nGood General Idea - Not detailed = meaningless.\\nC. Plot\\nNovel in general but the lack of detail lessens the entire novelty.\\n---\\nClearly not for CPN(character, progress, novelty)-oriented individuals.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9539af803d5c27c5b7e708b5fc49b0ca'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I\\'m not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list.\\nIf you\\'re reading you probably came here looking to see if you should watch this anime or if my opinion is the same as yours, and please do not forget what this is, MY review.\\nLet us start with the best: The story - 10/10\\nFullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood\\'s plot is the most incredible thing I have seen in an anime, seriously, If i could, I would go and\\nmeet Hiromu Arakawa and thank her for having an amazing imagination and ability to create and draw this masterpiece. You may be thinking \"Another fanboy, better find a real review\", and well, maybe you\\'re right, but I have to praise what deserves to be praised, and this certaninly does.\\nSure you can say the first episodes were a bit rushed, but wouldn\\'t people still complain if they had slowed it down instead? For me the pacing of the story felt natural and that they did not need to waste the beginning of the series explaining the story since it is slowly explained as the anime progresses.\\nThe Art - 10/10\\nSometimes an anime can feel a little off when the art style does not please our eyes, even though the story is actually good, but this is definitely not the case. The art style is really enjoyable and I just loved those round faces!\\nThe fight scene, don\\'t even get me started! The animation is gorgeous and Bones sure knows how to deliver well-animated fights with amazing angles and details that really make the watcher enjoy what the\\'re watching.\\nThe Sound - 10/10\\nI can tell you this: I have every opening on my cellphone and I regularly listen to the ending songs and background music when I feel like listening to those serene and beautiful soundtracks or the epic songs from the  several fight scenes. The voice actors did an amazing job with every single character, and even though I did not watch the dubbed version, I did watch a couple of bits on youtube, and it sounded pretty well too. I don\\'t think there\\'s much else to say here, top notch as always.\\nThe characters - 10/10\\nThe second best thing about Fullmetal Alchemist is it\\'s characters. Every single character has a completely different personality and exceptional development, each one having their different reasons to act the way they do.\\nEven the villains are awesome, with their dark stories and troubled personalities that make our heros\\' journey be long and troublesome. It also has the best main villain of all time from any anime I\\'ve seen so far, that\\'s a +1 right there.\\nEnjoyment - In case it\\'s not obvious by now, 10/10\\nI enjoyed every single episode from this amazing series which left me sitting on the edge of my seat with all the plot-twists and cliffhangers that followed the previous one, that with the awesome animation quality by Bones, beautiful soundtracks and lots of relatable characters with funny, troubled, brave and heartwarming personalities.\\nOverall - 10/10\\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was an amazing experience that managed to surpass it\\'s other version\\'s \"awesomness\" and show us what anime truly is about, and that\\'s how it managed to reach my #1 spot, truly a masterpiece that won\\'t be forgotten anytime soon, at least by me it won\\'t. :)', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6af27fd260f740f989e928b479b3edf9'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '\"You have to believe in yourself. Because if you don\\'t believe in yourself, you will not only bring down yourself, but also many others that believe you and depend on you.\"\\nIt may not be a quote directly cited from the series, but it is one of the things this series has taught me. This show was great from start to end, and despite knowing some spoilers beforehand, it still delivered to a 10 out of 10 rating - something that\\'s not usually happening for a shonen anime because they tend to overuse a certain trope.\\nTo kick off, I have been fairly reluctant to watch Fullmetal\\nAlchemist: Brotherhood, because I have already seen the first series before the remake happened, and I was afraid that half of the anime would be the same as season 1, but since I heard it had rave reviews, I have put it in the corner of my plan to watch list anyway. Some long time after that, I heard the threat that many anime sites are going to be shut down, and I panicked by mass-watching anime and reading manga. Fullmetal Alchemist was one of the anime I started to watch during that period.\\nThe story was admittedly a little predictable. But that might have been because I saw the first season, and a few spoilers on what happens ahead, or it might have not been. Despite the fair predictability, the anime has still delivered a great dose of tension, drama, fun, light-hearted moments to not make me burst out in tears from the heavy dramatic ones, and also action - thus I believe majority of the viewers would enjoy. If anyone is discouraged by the 64 episodes, just start slowly, you\\'ll notice it will consume you in no time, because this anime is one of the few that are neither rushed or way too slow-paced.\\nSome people say D.Gray-man sneaks around seinen territory, but not nearly as much as this anime. The plot gets into a fairly dark theme at times, sometimes even gets slightly into political matters...  and the art matches it well. The colors are not very vibrant, which might have taken a toll on the character designs - then again, this toll has made the characters even more believable and gave distinctive features to them and their descendants.\\nThe soundtrack matches the mood of the anime in all possible moments. Violin is used for several melodies of the soundtrack, which make a perfect match for the dark theme of the anime. As for the openings and endings, they consist of catchy songs, which serve as a great introduction/outro of the episodes. I also have no remarks to the seiyuus, as they did a fairly well job to match the characters\\' profile.\\nWith matching art and matching voice actors, it is possible to admit the fact that the profile of the characters is constructed to be fairly believable - they have their ups and downs, and it is possible to tell where the characters \"got that attitude from\". Their reactions are also believable; they do not overreact as much as it happens on other anime of this genre. I would cite a few examples, but I\\'d prefer to avoid any spoilers so you see that for yourself.\\nWith all that overall, Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood was a very captivating and enjoyable show, captivating me enough to take much breaks than most anime I have watched. I believe the masterpiece rating is indeed deserved for this one, although I wouldn\\'t quite recommend it for starting audiences, as it would make their expectations of other anime series too high... then again I\\'m just kidding! You probably won\\'t regret watching this one whatever audience you are from, but I can\\'t tell you that for sure - you\\'ll have to see for yourself.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e74124dc8017bdf44cfd4722b5cd36de'}>,\n",

This movie certainly does not allow any greater understanding into the mind of deaf people is the point I want to iterate. It uses a serious problem as a plot device constantly and reduces Nishimiya to one-dimension. She is the textbook definition of a mary-sue as well as a damsel in distress. This is clearly troublesome when trying to explain deafness to an able-bodied audience.\\nNishimiya\\'s entire character is her illness. She is paper thin with her sole character trait being she likes\\nto feed fish. She is so inhuman it is gross. Moe being used in this way is offensive. Including deafness or any other handicap into anime is an exciting idea, and I laud the attempt. Sadly, the execution is simply sickening. A personality-less self-insert male character who wants to repent for mistakes he made when he was a child falls in love with the object of his errs. It\\'s inherently questionable to approach this topic from a romantic perspective because it\\'s hard to sympathize with an object. And that is what Nishimiya is, an object. To be affected on, for us to pity, for us to see illness in a \"new light,\" to justify against bullying, to see the indomitable human spirit. A show like Monster works this concept excellently because it uses the object of interest (Johan) as more of a symbol. This work tries to make Nishimiya a character as deeply developed as Shouya but they foist too many roles on an underdeveloped symbol, not even mentioning her role as a character.\\nShouya, Ueno, and Ishida are all flat. Their motives are drawn to plot points not to logic. Ueno shows up when things finally start moving in a direction the audience would be satisfied with in tacky KyoAni fashion. Drama in this work is so over-the-top and predictable it\\'s borderline cringe-worthy. Even if you could swallow the unbelievable developments that lead to the saccharine mid-section of the film the way it dissolves is so inauthentic. Shouya shows no signs of development and no effort to change throughout the work and then magically obtains a group of friends.\\nAs for the abstract? The art? If you polish it up enough and use a voice technique the audience is unfamiliar with you have the safest ticket to visual and audio praise you can muster. Are there creative shots in this work? Impressive blocking of characters? Fresh setting or new takes on animation/style? No. This is a typical KyoAni work. They stuck with what sells.\\nWhat the point is thematically I can\\'t tell you. I can tell you that this film is successfully doing what it wanted to do. Capitalize on disease using moe with the highest budget in the industry. This work is not even average, it is bad. Please stop and think about why you feel the way you do when you watch this work. If you\\'re crying is it because Nishimiya is a person you have become endeared by or are you crying because she\\'s like an injured puppy? Affection for things like this a wonderful human trait, but this work is dubious.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a5a855479047ee78dab0fe7ab5c7f615'}>,\n",

Leaving some with empty character.\\n[Enjoyment] 10 - Tears, sadness, anger, happiness and laughs, the whole package.\\n[Overall] 8 - Definitely would watch again.\\nFor those wondering how and where I watched this film, I watched in Japan. At Keisei Rosa10 in Chiba on September 17th.\\nHaving read the manga 4 times over and crying every time, I went into the theater\\nnot expecting much tears as I have pretty much dried up my emotional experience with this manga.\\nHowever, much to my surprise, it has been a very, very long time since I have cried that much while watching a movie. Even comparing to a similar anime film Anthem of the Heart, which surprisingly lacked the ability to really give me a tearful moment. Not to say it wasn't a bad movie, but if you liked that one, you will certainly like this.\\nBe prepared for a emotional roller coaster as the movie plays with your ever so weakening heart as the movie progresses.\\nThat being said, this is no perfect movie. The story falls short, very short in terms of character/plot progression outside of the two main characters. Perhaps it was because of the limit of having to cram the story into a 2 hour film that the writers had to cut corners.\\nHowever, story/character development of Shoya was spot on. The movie clearly delivered his character and it was very easy to sympathize and relate to the character. Same with Shoko, though the film did leave out some specifics, the repercussions of Shoko's existence could be felt where one may even agree with Ueno who despised her.\\nUnfortunately, the remaining characters were pretty much left out. And the overall story was ultimately incomplete because of this. With audiences who hasn't read the manga asking why some characters were even there. Character development with the side characters were very lacking and a lot of important details were stripped apart leaving a big hole in the story.\\nThe only character who avoided this cut was Yuzuru who retained a lot of her details and character development.\\nThis meant that people who haven't read the manga can be very confused by the end of the movie. As I had heard people talking about while leaving the theater.\\nMany details were left out, but the film retained a lot of the core elements from the manga in puzzle pieces, allowing those who read the manga to fill in the gaps to understand what it means. But that also meant those who haven't were left scratching their heads.\\nBesides the emotional road trip of your lifetime, Nagatsuka's moments in the film are very comedic and actually funny in a lot of ways. Often when the audience was laughing, it was usually when Nagatsuka was at his antics.\\nAs for the art, no complaints here. Besides having some overally familiar Kyoani characters faces, Kyoto Animation has done a excellent job in representing the characters true to the manga. It's no Makoto Shinkai film, but the quality is nothing to scoff at. The high quality is retained throughout the entire film and no lazy production was visible.\\nVoice acting was top notch and sounded very familiar to daily Japanese life. Though overall sound was okay. The creative use of music in the film is a bonus. Besides that, not much to write home about.\\nThe movie tried to stay true to the manga as best as it could and in the core elements in delivering the original message that the manga had, it succeeded.  But unfortunately while following the path, they dropped a lot of it's side content.\\nThe movie was able to deliver the core plot of the manga.\\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable film and I can't wait for the disc release.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e20bfc2db1dd3f349736074910da53bb'}>,\n",

It is a powerful enough film to remember and ponder over, and people may draw different lessons, or perhaps none.\\nPros: The sound and vision (KnK\\nis top-notch Japanimation. I dare say that in some aspects, it is better than a Ghibli film). The ambient piano background music really matches with parts of the film, and the use of marimbas and even silence at the dramatic climax worked out well. Shoko Nishimiya is adorable when she has that half-proud and half-shy face when she does ponytail. Cute, but elegantly done and not unpleasant. However, was this better than Tamako Loves Story - I cannot tell. There were recognizably magical rooftop sequences in Yamada\\'s K-On! and at the classroom and school ground with Midori in Tamako Love Story. I am not sure whether KnK had such \"magic\" moment despite its very fluid art.\\nVoice actors have all done a great job. Saori Hayami, Yuki Aoi, Miyu Irino were expectedly good, and Kaneko Yuki (who played Midori in Tamako) was a great pick for Ueno, another difficult character.\\nCon: I feel that the original manga\\'s theme was very challenging for a very young manga artist to deal with; I also felt that some themes weren\\'t fully explored or developed properly. Besides the bullying/redemption theme, there is an attachment/detachment in relationship theme, and on top of that, a male-female friendship and romance theme. Those themes coexisted and had resonated against each other for sure, but it\\'s not done in a well-calculated and clear-cut way. That was the main issue of the serial manga, and to explore those themes, the manga author had to involve the characters to comes to terms with each other in a slightly forced situation (like the movie club and the event of going to a theme park).\\nAlthough the story line of the movie club was completely cut and altered, the theme park sequence was saved for the film- which still felt forced. However, I felt that Reiko Yoshida has done a nearly perfect job with script-writing and editing the story to be able to fit in for a two hours film. My only grievance is that the reason behind Nishimiya\\'s decision at the climax was not convincingly told (which was as in the manga- but the Manga fully told Shoko\\'s mother\\'s sufferings of being divorced because of her child\\'s disabilities and sis Yuzuru\\'s side story of being bullied because of the same reason- so there was a more natural reason why Shoko should have cumulative feeling of guilt that she was making other people involved with her unhappy [and not just that sense of guilt towards breaking up Shoya\\'s relationship with others]). Viewers might be puzzled then why Shoko had to make that decision in the climax (as it was already not exactly written convincingly to start with in the original manga).\\nFinal verdict: Having written down the cons, this is a very challenging work of art (yes, \"art\", which is not simple \"entertainment\"), and it did choke my heart at several moments. This won\\'t be everyone\\'s favorite, as it deals with a serious and dark issue, and as it\\'s not all straightforward (as in Tamako Love Story) - but it leaves viewers questioning about their own relationship with other people in the past and present.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9bbad30b9b704b5123a0881e5be0a30a'}>,\n",

But I was waiting for anime adaptation since that time. Even though kinda hoped for series, not just a movie.\\nI must say that I was a little worried about it airing at the same time with Kimi no Na wa, but it still seems alright, box office going good,\\neven though it is three times less than Kimi no Na wa (but don't compare original movie made by Makoto Shinkai with manga adaptation, even from KyoAni).\\nBut for the first half an hour (or maybe more) I was sitting quietly, being afraid to move even, cause it grasped me completely. I was feeling anger, pity, shame, a whole parade of emotions. Story felt good and dramatic, as Japanese like to do. Never ending and always sharp problems of bullying in school, attitude to people with disabilities who are trying to fit in the society.\\nAnimation was great. This is what you should expect from Kyoto Animation. And don't try to compare it to Kimi no Na wa, it is really just on different level from the very beginning. And camera work! It was really incredible, I loved tons of shots, how they tried to accent on legs and lower parts of the body (I mean shots excluding characters' heads :D).\\nBut as for characters and their development, movie had some problems. Both two main characters were shown great. But such a large amount of, probably, interesting supporting characters weren't developed good enough, even though the movie is more than 2 hours. Like Mashiba (red-haired guy in anime), for instance, he said just few phrases and felt really left out. And two ex-friends of Ishida from elementary school seem to have been forgotten at all, even though there were at least two scenes with them. And there were some shots that I didn't quite understand, like, for example, why Shouya's mom was bleeding and looked really beaten up, after she gave money to Shouko's mom? She beat her, really?\\nIn general, I enjoyed it a lot, and can say that it's the second best movie by KyoAni (after Haruhi, obviously) and it is definitely worth watching.

It is one of the finest animation quality out there, and if romance genre is your cup of tea, you will probably like the movie. Even if you don't like romance, it is not a disappointing film.\\nOk, I'll start off by saying that I did not read the\\nmanga before hand so I will try my best to not assume what the original content did(I will definitely read it).\\nThat being said, I have to mention that frankly, I was worried that I was not going to enjoy this movie as much as I initially thought I did because I still was stuck in the Kimi no Na Wa void. I was really worried that the visuals Kimi no Na Wa presented me with was Makoto Shinkai level amazing and I thought I would have been disappointed by Koe no Katachi just because I show Kimi no Na Wa beforehand.\\nReally, It did not disappoint me at all. The animation quality of Koe no Katachi is just tremendously amazing; Kyoto animation with a film budget definitely get things glittering don't they.\\nAside from animation quality, the two 'meh' part of this movie was the story and the character. I can say that the pacing of the story was good. The climax wasn't too rushed, nor the premise wasn't too long and boring. I had enough time to get introduced to the characters and how they live through life before everything happened. As well as enough time for the important events to sink through my brain for comprehension. Now the problem was it was spending too little time outside of our two mains.\\nI remember a point in the movie where a bunch of kids were shouting out random gibberish to one another that obviously was not explored beforehand or even if it was, it was very vague. Thus made a potentially emotionally climatic scene to a lackluster. I would have understood how each character would have felt and reacted if I was able to know the side characters a lot more. Which leads to the failure of a solid side character I will be talking about next.\\nI hate how the side characters were unexplored throughout the 2 hours. Honestly, I get it, 2 hours isn't heck load of time to explore every single aspect of the original source material(I read through other reviews that a lot of events that happened in the manga was skipped), but still, some characters obviously did not matter(which those characters did not give damn about the two mains), furthermore, the characters that did seem important just got overshadowed. For example, so Mashiba satoshi a bad guy after all or not? I was just left hanging urging to know if that guy was genuine(hehe oregairu) or not. His eyes still makes me uncomfortable when he looks at Ishida. Even worse, Ueno's goal was just forgotten entirely by the end; Ueno mentioned how she wanted to go back to a period when all of the classmates when she was young were still happy together. However, in the end, did she just change her mind and let the whole friend thing drop? I did not see the development of change in her mindset to eventually like Nishimiya in the end. I hope the manga does cover side characters a lot more so the whole 'Im sorry all I wanted is ....' part actually does make sense.\\nAlbeit, in the end, Koe no Katachi did pull off a pretty emotional moment, twice to be exact, during the climax. Not as much as Kimi no Na Wa(also Kimi no Na Wa struck me harder a lot more times), but I still believe that KyoAni had done what was needed to adapt an emotional story. The art  was phenomenal, the voice acting was good, music was really good too(props on Aiko for the song in the ending credits), the characters and the story was a little underdeveloped where it was needed, but regardless of that I enjoyed the movie and I can guarantee it was worth the 2 hours of my time.\\nMad respect for Kyoto animation pulling off that animation tho.(I had to mention it again).\\nIt was my first review but hopefully, it helped someone, somewhere in the world out there ;)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '39b5448491d2d2ccdf765a3b5ba8620b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Overview:\\nA Silent Voice is a VERY popular anime and I can see its appeal. This is an anime that is beautifully animated by the much beloved Studio Kyoto. It has a soundtrack featuring The Who! It promised to actually address the issue of bullying far better than previous anime and give it the serious look it deserves. It promised to be a beautiful redemption tale and love story all in one. This anime SHOULD have been amazing. Sadly, I was really not a fan of this film and was badly disappointed to say the least. I\\'m not trolling. I\\'m not being contrarian for the lulz.\\nI\\'m quite serious and I\\'ll explain why.\\nWarning! There will be some spoilers!\\nBullying and its portrayal in anime:\\nBefore discussing the technical things like art and music, I really need to cover this topic. Bullying is a real world issue that effects millions of people around the world and contributes to suicide, depression, eating disorders, etc. Unfortunately, anime has a long and generally horrendous history in terms of tackling this topic. Bullies in anime tend to be like bullies in a Stephen King novel. They tend to be 1 dimensional bastards that exist solely to torment our heroes and eventually get their grisly comeuppance. When I heard about an anime that would finally give this topic the respect it deserved, I was thrilled! Finally an anime could help redeem over 40 years of the medium doing it wrong. Here are some reasons I feel this film fell short.\\nA deaf girl named Shouko transfers into a 6th grade class and immediately the whole class start tormenting her and treating her like shit. Our MC Shouya repeatedly yanks out her hearing aids and destroys them in front of everyone. He does this EIGHT TIMES in 5 months and even makes her bleed out of her ears. The teacher just ignores this abuse until Shouko\\'s mother complains. The teacher then singles out Shouya and only Shouya to be the fall guy. Does he get expelled? Suspended? Detention? Nope. His mother is told and she scolds him. Shouya doesn\\'t take his loving mother\\'s lesson to heart and physically assaults Shouko. The school STILL doesn\\'t do anything against Shouya. Kid doesn\\'t even get detention. I know Japan is a different culture than America, but WTF?! This all seems absurdly contrived.\\nFirstly, this would be far more believable if it was a Kindergarten class and not fucking 6th graders. Kindergarten kids have no established morals and really will bully kids in overt ways for being different. I still remember when a little Asian girl transferred into my all White kindergarten in Indiana. We all did \"Asian Eyes\". We all called her names. One kid started doing monkey chants, so we all started doing monkey chants. It was fucked up and I STILL feel bad about it now that I\\'m 30. By the the 6th grade, kids are FAR less likely to universally bully a kid for being a little different and the ways in which they bully are different. By the 6th grade, kids will bully by not talking to an unpopular kid, shunning them, and maybe attacking them on social media. A whole 6th grade class being supportive of physically beating up a little deaf girl and making her bleed from the ears is pretty damn unlikely to say the least.\\nSecondly, a character needs to do horrible things in order to set up a redemption tale. However, we are typically given a REASON why the character begins the story that way. This reason doesn\\'t justify their actions, but it makes the audience understand the hero and what is going through their mind. Let\\'s take a break from anime and look at another popular redemption movie, American History X. So why did Derek become a Neo-Nazi? He was raised by a father who was pretty racist and instilled a bit of that in him at a young age. Derek\\'s father was murdered in a high crime Black neighborhood. Derek angrily blamed minorities for his father\\'s murder and looked for groups to channel his anger. He ended up finding one of the many racist groups that exist in America both online and off, which reinforced his beliefs and helped mold him into the character we see at the beginning. Shouya on the other hand, is an absolute monster towards the handicapped for no reason. He comes from a loving, middle class family. He isn\\'t a natural born sociopath. He isn\\'t the least popular kid in school and desperate to make 1 person beneath him on the totem pole. He isn\\'t being persuaded by some warped ideology that encourages bullying the handicapped in order to transcend traditional morality and prove himself an Ubermensch. He goes way farther than anyone else in his class and at no point are we EVER given a modicum of why or what he\\'s thinking. Shouya begins the story a complete monster for no other reason than to set up a redemption tale.\\nOk, so they fucked up a little. At least Silent Voice still tackles bullying WAY better than other anime...right? Honestly, no it doesn\\'t. Let\\'s set the bar really low and see how A Silent Voice compared to Elfen Lied, an anime that is widely agreed to have done a poor job tackling the issue. The main bully in Elfen Lied is a little brat named Tomoo. This kid is a 10 year old orphan being raised at a chronically underfunded and neglectful orphanage. Nobody is showing kindness to him, so he torments others in order raise himself up. At least we can understand Tomoo and his motivations, so point 1 goes to EL. Now let\\'s look at their targets. Shouko is hard of hearing, but is otherwise an ordinary little girl. She is extremely cheerful and extroverted. No matter how much she is bullied, she forgives with saintlike compassion and tries to befriend Shouya, who just laughs at her and beats her up more. Lucy has red eyes and demonic horns. She objectively looks like a freak within her own anime. Prior to snapping, Lucy responds to bullying with the same cold, disdainful glare. Lucy doesn\\'t try to befriend Tomoo. Her defiant attitude, difficulty showing emotions, and introverted personality all end up contributing to further bullying, which is accurate to real life. Point 2 goes to EL. Now lets look at how over the top the bullying was. The worst thing Tomoo did was beat Lucy\\'s dog to death. Now in America, we value dogs at almost the level we value humans. Killing a dog is an unforgivable act of villainy. In most of the world, constantly ripping out the hearing aids of a little deaf girl, destroying them, and beating her up over a period of 5 months for no reason is far worse than killing 1 dog. Shouya\\'s unbelievable, over the top cruelty exceeds any action taken by Tomoo. Point 3 goes to Elfen Lied. Congratulations Silent Voice! You just got owned by fucking Elfen Lied. You overrated piece of horse shit!\\nPlot and characters:\\nAfter 30 minutes of our MC being the biggest douche in anime that is NOT Dio Brando, we flash forward to high school. The entire class immediately switched from bullying Shouko to bullying Shouya. I guess they have exactly 1 target at a time. Now Shouya is a good guy and wants to make things up to Shouko. We of course already know Shouko is the most forgiving character that isn\\'t supposed to be a Christ character or represent the very best of humanity, so our only real obstacle is another girl from their 6th grade class named Naoka. We see that Naoka still HATES Shouko and is an absurdly evil bitch because she blames Shouko for Shouya being bullied...even though she herself helped bully Shouya. In the manga, Naoka has her own redemption arc in parallel to Shouya\\'s and ends up really developing as a character. In the movie, they had to cut that out and she\\'s just an evil bitch that adds NOTHING to this story. She isn\\'t even the antagonist of this tale. An antagonist actually ADDS something to the plot! I\\'m not going to spoil the whole ending, but I found its sentimentality to be utterly ineffectual. We also can\\'t have an effective romance because that requires TWO likeable characters. The only character with any development and depth deeper than a rain puddle is Shouya. It\\'s like the film writer honestly didn\\'t give a shit about anyone else.\\nArt:\\nYes, the art is pretty and cute and Studio Kyoto is awesome. The X\\'s over characters\\' faces when they are rejecting Shouya was a cool touch. I don\\'t have anything to criticize here. It was good, but not good enough to save this from being a mess.\\nMusic:\\nWell...at least we got 1 song by the Who. That\\'s more than most anime.\\nOverall:\\nI really wanted to love this anime like everyone else apparently does. This was honestly one of the more disappointing anime experiences I\\'ve had in a long time. The characters besides 1 are badly underdeveloped. The plot is a contrived mess that utterly fails at tackling bullying better than past anime. The romance is lackluster and I got very few genuine feels out of this one. The art and production values are spectacular. The premise on paper is great. Then it all seems to fall apart. Kind of like Joker Game in that regard, which I won\\'t bother reviewing because I just basically did. I\\'m not going to warn people away and scream to \"Not buy the hype\". Maybe someone else will have a different experience and really enjoy this film. This was just my experience and my own thoughts.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"[This review contains NO spoilers]\\nThis is a story about the importance of listening and the effects of not doing so. It something we can all understand and learn from.\\nSocial anxiety, Suicide, self loath/pity, forgiveness/acceptance, attachment, the desire/difficulty to be connect and most of all the complexity of human communication and emotions - all covered in this Movie as you delve into a journey to unravel a facade to find emotions we all contain and hide from others to void the difficulty of conveying them. We follow a character who closes his mind and refuses not to listen to create his own cynical narrative and in\\nit we learn voice (koe) - or communication - has many shapes and forms (Katachi) and that it's shallow to think it's all monotonous.\\nWhen I heard Kyoto - with their legendary art style - was going to make a favourite manga of mine into a movie, I contemplated packing my bags and going to Japan for it's premier. Sadly I lacked the funds so I had to settle for the nearest cinema in London - 3 excruciating months after it's release.\\nIt was sad to see the seats half empty, but when the movie started, the 60 year old man behind me was laughing, gasping and getting emotional along with the rest of the diverse crowd and this shows how well the message of the movie resonated and how universal the enjoyment was.\\nThe plot evoked a roller coaster of emotions, some easy to emphasis with, and others MADE easy to resonate with! The plot starts vigorously but with a pace you could easily keep up with. It slightly stagnates to build context until the plot's climax  - which got my spine tingling - a climax that I don't want to ruin for the unsuspecting! But the stagnation is what stops it from getting a 10/10 for it's plot. The strategic retreat from the plot's focus enabled for a good few laughs and set up what was to come very well, but it turned a 2 hours movie into what felt like a 3 hour movie, where I was anticipating the end mid way though as it seemed like they had reached a happily ever after. It somewhat ruined the experience for me and I felt like it could have been executed better by adding some more romantic develop (because I felt more pity for the characters than love).\\nI hate to be the guy who boasts how much better the source content was, but it's necessary to mention that a lot of the 60 + chapters of plot couldn't fit into the 2 hours time frame - hence we got hastily implemented and unexplained developments that the manga could easily clear up (one of the biggest being that fat that they all set out to make a movie and that is the real crux of how the MC makes and learns to socialise with friends), frankly the manga and movie could be considered separate entities considering their different approaches and focuses to this plot. This is a clear limitation the anime movie medium of story telling has so I can't personally penalise too much for doing the best it could, certainly better than other movie adaptations - and I rate based on comparison. There was room to fix some of the issues related to this, such as by removing some of the pretty/still/un-progressive scenes in exchange for progressive and informative development from the source content. Then again removing them could have made it feel too dense/melancholic and would likely have ruined the nice pace it set out and the mood those particular scenes set - so it hard to criticise.\\nThe art was stunning, and Kyoto included their trademark extra, where the frames are never still - there are always subtle things happening in the background that just adds the cherry on top of their memorising art. The art could get any anime brownie points including Phantom world. Every nook and carny was accounted for, from the curves in the fingers, the change in colour form skin to nail to the glow emitted by the bright lighting and the distortion of their realistic dynamic multi tone shadows. Kyoto kept to their cutesy shiny art style with tranquil backgrounds and scenery - and props for their consistently amazing colour pallet.\\nThe voice acting was ace, like most anime - at this point it's a given considering how serious people take voice acting in Japan. The music hit the spot, it started of with an English song, which may have confused the Japanese audience if they were unable to translate the lyrics, but it was pretty clever and a good way to summarise the first few chapters of the Manga which the movies wanted to power through with to save time. The Musics crept up on you and exploded sometimes, others it gently wrapped it's arms around you as you desperately tried to hold the tears back, And as your face prepared to unleash an unforced smile, the music came in to amplify it.\\nAll in all, coming out of the cinema was hard, there was a plethora of emotions and thoughts swirling around in my mind, it created a moral dilemma that still has my mind in conflict now. Nothing felt too cliche apart for the typical anime personalities, which can be over looked considering what the plot done with them. The movie was truly touching, the ascetics was mind-blowingly good and the music was on point.\\nI enjoyed it as an avid fan of Romance, particular dramatic ones - despite the romance not being completely conclusive in the movie. I enjoyed this more than any other anime of it's type, and I'm sure anyone with the same taste wouldn't hesitate to give it a 10/10 and others wouldn't dare give it bellow an 8 unless it's not their thing.\\n*=======================================================================================*\\nPersonal Onion/side note:\\nMany had an issue with what they saw as an emotionally manipulative plot that stereo typed emotions and disabilities and thought it gave a shallow outlook on them. However I think expecting a movie that tackles these theme elegantly with precision is too much to ask for, especially of the length of this plot and with it's density in content. Some people are choosing to get offended by how deaf people and suicidal people are presented here - as if this anime was tailored to be the political ambassador for these groups of people and has a duty outline the existence of a variation of people in these groups, as well as representing them as strong independent people - rejecting (or at least wanting to mask) the existence of vulnerable people in this category. It seems like this leads them to think adding convenience in a plot and a catalyst for progression is inherently a bad thing, as if the purpose of media itself isn't to entertain with by showing a collision of stark stereotypes that enable recognition and empathy (as well as saving time on unnecessarily developing a character from birth to present day) but to make a perfect recreation or reality without abstraction and stereotypes of entities (something even a computer is not capable of) that is primarily to educate viewers and not provide entertainment that's not difficult to decipher.\\nOf course not everyone who make such points fall into the pitfall of expecting too much form their medium, but many seem to give these point significant weight in their score, with a few minor flaws seeming to elicit a deduction more than 3+ points out of 10. They are free to do this and I have no right to lecture them on their scoring system, but I just think it's inefficient, ineffective and lacks the investment of deep thought with a widened scope - IE. it clashes with my philosophy. If you fall into this category and can enlighten me on your perspective I'd really appreciate it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ca057f96b398ab41c807d2f592461f30'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Everyone in the world is distinctive, each person having both positive and negative aspects about them, and every society is known for their own distinctive features. There are those who disagree with this view as nothing more than a blind and false generalization, and there are those who completely agree with it. Both ways of thinking, in my opinion, are unnecessarily exaggerated. The best solution for this is a balance, as we cannot hide one society’s trait, nor can we realistically say that a whole society belongs to a certain feature. For example, Japanese people are considered to be people who love a clean environment,\\nso, does that mean that every single Japanese acts in this manner? Certainly not, but most of them do act upon this certain trait. The characteristics of a society are important for identifying an important case, and that is that the goals of a story are to display those attributes in a precise manner, and to display the solutions that can be found in a literary artistic context, and not in an informative one. The Anime movie, Koe no Katachi, presents a social issue of Japanese society. So, how credible is this particular movie? How good is it’s credibility, and what are it’s positive aspects, and it’s negative ones?\\nTo start off with the story, it is supposed to be an autobiography about a young guy called Shouya, and the movie displays what occurs in his life from his elementary school days up until he reaches high school, and that is by highlighting the events that had a relation with him bullying and picking on his deaf classmate, a girl by the name of Shouko. So, what are the consequences of his insolent actions? And what will happen in this regard? This is the structure of the story, and it is rather good, because this structure depends on two essential elements that rarely fail. The first element, is picking the prospective of the story to be an autobiography. The best thing about picking an autobiography as a story is the fact that the viewer’s attachment during the story, and even after the story had concluded, is set on a human, and not on an object or a place. Meaning that the attachment of the viewer is not on an event or a set of particular events, nor on any action sequences, nor anything else. The attachment of the viewer is solely on a person with realistic features and components, aka a human. This is useful due to the fact that the viewer feels that they have identified and related with a human on an emotional scale. The second essential element of this story, is that the movie highlights interesting occurrences that go on in that character’s life. I can safely say that the story of Shouya, from him picking on his classmate Shouko, and the effect that had on their lives and on their classmates, is very intriguing to look at and watch.\\nThe beginning of the movie was light and quickly used a hook that was impactful, even if I found the hook to be used way too early on in the story, because the time between that particular hook, until we reach the dilemma of the story, is long enough to the point where it can lessen the effect of that strong hook later on in the story. As for the events, I find that the script was very useful in portraying each and every single event, because I did not find one event with little to no meaning, and there are two essential categories that the writer used when it came to the events: Events which were centered around building the story, and events that were pivotal to the story. I really liked how these events were distributed throughout the narrative, and the way the writer dealt with them, due to the fact that many writers don’t know how to execute the events that build the story in an interesting manner. Usually, these events are dull, and the reason for that is due to the fact that they are non-interactive and their mission is to build characteristics within the characters in order to crystallize a pivotal event. I was surprised though, that these beginning events were more interesting than boring, and the reason for that is thanks to the realistic nature of the dialogue.\\nThe characters here were fairly realistic, and they reflect on the age group they were placed in in a very precise way, whether they were in elementary school or when they became high schoolers, and it is an effort that deserves respect. Moreover, the Japanese values that are displayed here and the degree of emotion that characterizes the Japanese is correct, and that is very excellent. The way of communication between the students, the two genders and the general etiquette of Japanese society is to be found. Subsequently, the film was able to present a true image to a very good degree of the society it was representing. Unfortunately, there is a problem to be found in the duration of the film, which is that I find it to be longer than it needs to be. The length of the whole movie is a timely two hours and ten minutes, and this is a fatal mistake that cannot be overlooked. All of the characters and the events would have needed an hour and a half at most for them to be fleshed out accordingly, and if the staff had stuck to an hour and a half, then that would have greatly benefited both the movie and the audience as well. As for the climax of the story, it was written both emotionally and cleverly, and in a way that was harmonious to the narrative. The ending, though fairly normal and drab, is still credible in accordance to the events that take place in the movie. There is a dramatic exaggeration that I didn’t find good though, and a negative point that spoils the ending a little, which is Shouya’s dramatic reaction at the end. This particular scene is challenging to settle, as the producers messed up on this one. It doesn’t really ravage the film entirely, but it surely mitigates the strong emotional impact that could have been reaped.\\nHomogeneous to many Anime, there is a high quality in the selection of the camera angles. Each angle was carefully selected, and it’s dimensions chosen to direct the viewer’s attention to what the director seeks, and this movie was so creative with it’s angles, to the point where the viewer could recognize a character’s gender simply because of the genius that went into choosing the camera angles, the framing being very good as well. The animation is exquisite overall, but there is no point where it excels in quality and becomes above the normal standard. Excellent accuracy could be found when it comes to the facial expressions, but another problem is that sometimes it becomes difficult to understand the significance of those expressions and what they mean, as those expressions could be understood in a false sense by the audience. For example, there is a scene where Shouya offers someone to take his bike instead of his classmate’s bike, the facial expressions in that particular scene were correct, although they seemed to have been misplaced. Here I would have wished for the director to have at least used some sound effects to support the validity of what they wanted to convey, since the director managed to implement them when it came to later scenes in the movie.\\nThe character design worked well at diversifying the characters from one another and were compatible with each character’s own unique personality, except for Shouya’s design when he grew up into his highschool years, as I find that his character design should have made parallel changes in accordance to the heavy psychological trauma that was inflected on him as a child growing up. The background design is very well made, and the settings reflect correctly on the characters that reside in them. The performance of the Japanese cast is excellent, and the credibility of how the deaf communicate is done well. As for the soundtrack and the sound effects, I find that they played a vital role in supporting the narrative and enhancing the viewer’s experience, and the music's presence was very important, as the way it entered and exited scenes was ideal, to the point where it contributed to the continuous mobility in the vicinity of the story in a smooth manner, and without disturbing the viewer’s process in receiving the contents of the story.\\nIn conclusion, the long length of the movie being two hours and ten minutes, in addition to the ending that was fairly average and tended on thin, ruined what was supposed to be a great film. As such, a score of only a 7 could be given to this movie. Koe no Katachi, however, still remains a beautiful film, and it’s humanitarian messages are displayed in a respectful artistic manner. The characters are mostly fairly realistic, and they uniquely reflect an issue of Japanese society in a credible manner. The movie, A Silent Voice, is very well made, and it is still a movie worth checking out.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '12799b6a834078e8f2bea5687dd50734'}>,\n",

I\\'ll add the translation below, explaining why I put the \"low\" rating.\\nThe adaptation, from the point of view of someone who had already read the manga (even before any movie announcement existed), was mediocre. The character development was null, except for Shoya and Shoko (also Yuzuru and Ueno, more or less). Mashiba had no importance, the same as almost everyone else. In the manga we got to know why Mashiba was so nice and kind (and also saw him punch the face of our main character when he knew it was him who caused Shoko\\'s pain\\nin her childhood).\\nKoe no Katachi manga made me feel tensed and even cry. The tankobon in which we had Shoya unconscious was brutal.\\nNow, taking my overall opinion away, I\\'m gonna explain each and every aspect of my rating.\\n-Story (2/10): Terrible adaptation. Important scenes were cut off, even the most essential parts (like Shoya\\'s bench, which was shown but with no relevance). The detail of the crosses in people\\'s faces wasn\\'t so marked too. If I gave 1/10 to the adaptation, it would have been unfair, I admit. However, it doesn\\'t deserve a 3.\\n-Art (8/10): It would have been a 10/10, but it disgusted me to see the camera focusing wherever in most sign-language parts, instead of letting us see the characters communicating this way. Staff laziness to investigate, I guess?\\n-Sound (9/10): Cute selection, but not as memorable as in other Kyoto Animation films.\\n-Characters (4/10): The movie showed me the next:\\n>Shoya without any specific reason to change and become a good man.\\n>Cute Shoko who sadly lacked of interaction with anyone who wasn\\'t Shoya, Sahara, Yuzuru or Ueno.\\n>Forced Ueno. Staff wanted us to hate her (but, personally, I adore this character and Shoko in the manga).\\n>Miki and Mashiba. Both could have not appeared in the movie and the result would have been the same.\\n>Plot-device Sahara.\\n>Nice Yuzuru, but lacking of all the personality she had in the original version.\\n>Comedy-device Tomohiro.\\nTerrible development of almost everyone. I was thinking of a 3/10 for this aspect, but I\\'m merciful.\\n-Enjoyment (5/10): It was uncomfortable to see how ripped the original story was while the scenes advanced. However, I must admit there were a lot of scenes I enjoyed as separated fragments (instead of one \"full\" movie). I was disgusted but I enjoyed, so I give it an \"I don\\'t know\" (5/10).\\nOverall: 6\\nKoe no Katachi is a cute movie, but it angers me to see how high ranked it is in MAL while the manga is so below and without even reaching 9 as score.\\nMy direct comment for you, who is reading my review (and who I really thank for taking the time to do so), is to not feel so pleased with the movie and give the manga a chance. I don\\'t know, maybe you thought I was exaggerating in this review, but I would feel very pleased if you could return after reading the original version to tell me if you agree or disagree with me.\\nKoe no Katachi is a wonderful manga and it seriously deserved more than what was delivered to cinemas.\\n___________________________\\nSPANISH TRANSLATION\\nLa adaptación, desde mi punto de vista con el manga leído (desde antes de que siquiera existiera algún anuncio de película), fue mediocre. El desarrollo de personajes fue nulo, con excepción de Shoya, Shoko, Yuzuru y Ueno (más o menos). Mashiba no tuvo nada de importancia ni desarrollo en la película, al igual que casi todos los demás. En el manga, hasta llegamos a saber (quienes lo leímos) el por qué es tan buena onda (además de que disfrutamos la parte en la que, cuando se enteró de que Shoya era quien  molestaba a Shoko, le volteó el putazo de su vida).\\nEl manga me hizo sentir los momentos de tensión que, si bien sí estuvieron bien realizados en la película, por mucho no superó a los que tuve al leer la obra original. La parte del suicidio me hizo llorar y el volumen en el que el protagonista estuvo inconsciente fue brutal.\\nAhora diré cada aspecto, explicando por qué su calificación.\\n-Historia (2/10): La adaptación fue terrible. Eliminaron escenas vitales, como todo lo relacionado con los cuadernos de Nishimiya, la banca de Shoya, entre muchas escenas que habría sido cómico ver (como cuando descubren que Yuzuru es una chica en las regaderas). El detalle de los taches en las caras de las personas también fue menos marcado de lo que debió. Reconozco que darle 1/10 hubiese sido ya muy mala onda, pero definitivamente no merecía un 3.\\n-Arte (8/10): Hubiese sido un 10, pero me molestó mucho el hecho de que, cuando comenzaban a hablar con lenguaje de señas, la cámara volteaba a otros lados que nada tenían que ver. Eso denota flojera, si me lo preguntan.\\n-Sonido (9/10): Muy bonita selección, pero definitivamente no tan memorable como en otros trabajos de Kyoto Animation.\\n-Personajes (4/10): La película me dio a un Shoya que se volvió el chico buena onda sin razón alguna; una Shoko linda pero sin tanta interacción con otros personajes más que Shoya, Sahara, Yuzuru y Ueno; una Ueno que se vio forzada a ser el personaje odiable por el público (aunque personalmente adoro a este personaje en el manga), una Miki y un Mashiba que pudieron no haber estado en la película y el resultado hubiese sido el mismo; una Sahara que tampoco importó mucho más que para plot-device; una Yuzuru sin toda la personalidad que se le vio en el manga; y un Tomohiro que sólo sirvió para añadir comedia. Desarrollo terrible. Toda la familia de Shoya pasó muy inadvertida también (su madre y su sobrina se salvaban por poco). Estaba tentado a darle 3/10 pero soy misericordioso.\\n-Disfrute (5/10): Me fue muy molesta la película al ver, conforme avanzaba cada escena, las terribles mutilaciones que hacían. Aún así hubo escenas que sí disfruté mucho al tomarlas nada más como partes por separado y no como una película en conjunto. Me molestó pero a la vez sí disfruté un poco verla, por eso le doy un 5/10 (lo mismo que un \"no sé\") a este apartado.\\n-Calificación general: 6\\nEs una película bonita, pero me molesta mucho el que esté tan arriba en el ranking de MyAnimeList mientras que el manga esté más abajo y sin siquiera llegar a 9 de calificación. Mi comentario directo a tí, quien leyó mi crítica (y a quien agradezco haberla leído) es que no te quedes con la película. Si ya la viste y la pudiste disfrutar, te recomiendo mucho leer el One-Shot y el manga serializado. Tal vez, al haber leído mis ponderaciones, creas que estoy exagerando o que soy un hater nada más, pero estaré feliz de que vuelvas a darle una leída a mi comentario una vez que termines de leer el manga y me comentes en qué estás de acuerdo y en qué no.\\nKoe no Katachi es un manga grandioso y definitivamente se merecía más que lo que nos entregaron en las pantallas.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '28000ea80473c16674bb9cd55f2cc045'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I didn\\'t like A Silent Voice as much as I would have liked to. The storyline had so much potential but failed to step out of boundaries. Expressing issues like suicide, mental illnesses, and bullying is a challenge through a movie, but no matter what the mediocre plot remained. I am surprised that it is rated so highly, and I think it\\'s because of the main storyline that everyone loves it so much, but here\\'s why I rated it so low.\\nWhile there were signs of character development, there was so much skipping around. Instead of getting the viewer to understand what it really feels like\\nfor someone to develop anxiety, a decent amount of crying and small animated symbols filled the blank spaces instead. I thought that this movie would somehow prove that it was more than a typical storyline with a sad story, and it had the opportunity to tackle so many mental issues but did not go in depth with it.\\nThe movie is too much of an \"aesthetic\" vibe rather than a true story being told. The story is more revolved around the main character instead of the others around him who are also facing fair struggles of their own. Suicide is such a strong topic and yet it is not portrayed properly. Please don\\'t hand me the sad emotions with a suicide attempt.

I\\'m not talking of the \"easy\" \"I\\'m sorry\" i\\'m talking about the \"I\\'m sorry\" that comes from the bottom of your heart, the expression of your true feelings, being completely sorry, regretful, that word that burns inside you like hell... now, that\\'s really REALLY hard to say.\\nat first I thought that this movie was just a movie about how\\na bully and the bullied make a relationship by forgiving each other, but in reality, this movie goes beyond that, and I feel completely relatable to what this movie had to offer, because I once felt that, that need of telling people that I did hurt \"I\\'m sorry\" the sensation of being burned alive when doing it crushes your soul, but in the end, you\\'ll know it was totally worth it, you will feel relieved by doing so, and by watching this movie, you\\'ll understand why. I\\'ll try not to bully you with Spoilers, but you have been warned.\\nStory 10/10: if you have ever been bullied by someone, you will know how hard is to keep what you feel deep inside, developing fear, having trust issues, trying to keep yourself from people to avoid damage. it is something serious. having the will to overcome this is hard.\\nthe plot goes around an average boy that goes to a school, he had friends, money, good reputation. but one day, a girl appears, that girl is deaf, that girl tried to be friends with her classmates, tho, she only got rejected by many, specially from that boy, he kept bullying her, to the point of damaging her, not only physically, but psychologically too. here we see a complete turn of events, pretty much Karma. yes, Karma is a bitch, and this boy ends being the bullied one. Ironic isn\\'t it?.\\nAfter that introduction, there is the timeskip that deliver you the freaking ninjas cutting onions on your room, the amount of feels it manages to deliver is real. this movie takes your heart, and starts slicing it like you were on a heart surgery. why? well, past is a douche, he tells the future of your actions and then the present is in charge of destroying your life... all because of what? something as \"simple\" as bullying someone? is that easily forgotten? well is not easy, but hard.\\nfrom this point, you\\'ll see the word regret inside your mind as the story goes around the MC, he is trying to redeem himself from what he did before, but he doesn\\'t know the price he has to pay off, its a really big one, even if it sounds simple, it isn\\'t. the feel of being guilty attacks, those that once trusted him, no longer does. a lot of stuff gets on his way, he is only trying to talk to that girl he once bullied, he want to become her friend... but something prevents him of doing so... what could that be? hint: it isn\\'t the people that prevents him of doing so.\\nArt 10/10: you know a show is a masterpiece when it can deliver the feels with animation, is not just the fact of the topic of the movie, when it resonates with each aspect: Story, Ost, Characters, and the ninjas cutting onions on your room, I swear I could have cried if I wanted to, yet I decided to die deep inside, tho I was close to burst in tears, and I haven\\'t done this with a single anime... and that\\'s really saying something. that\\'s the power of the movie being delivered into your heart with images.\\nSound 10/10: Read Animation again, but exchange words related to animation to Sound and we have our deal with the sound department... ah, who am i Kidding? voice acting was GREAT, OST was GREAT, the sound of ninjas cutting onions was superb... this movie knows how to keep your heart in your hand the whole time.\\nCharacter 10/10: hate, sadness, pity, happyness, I felt each one of them on almost every character, not in a bad way of course. I also felt identified with the characters, being so relatable and knowing how they feel, is something heartbreaking, if you do, trust me, you will burst in tears, if you don\\'t then this means you have no heart or you haven\\'t experienced something like this... in fact, the character that would suit you is Ueno.\\nEnjoyment 1/10: sorry, but I couldn\\'t keep the Ninjas cutting Onions out of my room, I really enjoyed the movie. that, if Enjoyment means to get your heart crushed and wanting to burst in tears for 2 hours.\\nlet\\'s say that the scale of 1/10 having 1 as being sad, and 10 as being happy is what could define Enjoyment here, so scoring enjoyment as 1 is the same as scoring it as 10, even if that sounds pretty stupid XD\\nOverall 10/10: this movie is a bit rude, but meaningful, it touches deep topics with the most kind touch ever possible, so heartwarming, so relieving, so annoying, so happy, so upset, so freaking real.\\nDon\\'t let people say you can\\'t be friends with someone you once had a fight with and got separated due to that. regret will come one day crushing you, and you will know the POWERFUL meaning of the word \"I\\'m sorry\", and how hard it is to say to someone, even harder than the world \"I love you\"\\nnow, if you are satisfied now, I shall go to a corner and spent the rest of the day crying', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '18983391e46724d95008c147014b2f2d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I don\\'t like this movie. If you do, that\\'s great! I\\'m only writing this to warn people who, like me, might find this movie to be a waste of their time, and not to say anything negative about the fans of this movie.\\nStory - 1\\nI think the story, premise wise, is alright. A boy who used to be a bully tries to become friends with his old victim. However, in execution, I think this anime fails spectacularly.\\nThe pacing, for one thing, is extremely weird. I\\'m fairly sure this movie was supposed to cover several months, but I never really got a clear sense of what\\nhappened when. All the scenes seemed to kind of blend together, with no sense of how much time had passed in between scenes.\\nI didn\\'t feel like the characters really got anywhere, or even did much of anything. And yeah, it\\'s a drama, but that\\'s not really an excuse. It feels like they almost went through a checklist to make this whole thing.\\n-Establish cute heroine\\n-Gather childhood friends\\n-Have the characters forgive themselves/others.\\n-Have main characters fall in love.\\nThis last point was the one that really stood out to me. Why does Nishimiya suddenly fall in love with Ishida? Because he\\'s nice to her? If I fell in love with everyone who was nice to me, I would be in a lot of trouble.\\nNo, it\\'s not because there\\'s any logical reason. It\\'s because this movie needs to sell copies. I felt like that justification could fit a lot of the questions I had watching this movie. The whole experience just felt like it was engineered to be another Clannad/Anohana tearjerker, and not to stand on it\\'s own merits. Maybe this would had worked, but I couldn\\'t get absorbed into the experience at all. Mostly because of the awful characters.\\nThe story is also fairly slow, with few scenes I really felt moved the plot forward or developed the characters. I don\\'t mind slow pacing, but not when it serves nothing but to pad the movie out, and nothing else.\\nI\\'m going to get away from the actual story a bit, and talk about something that bothered me. The way mental health is portrayed in this anime is a little misleading, at best, and actively harmful at worst.\\nAt the start of the show, the main character is planning his suicide. That itself, is fine. It felt fairly realistic to me, and I appreciate when anime explores dark themes. What DID bother me was when his mother found out. She makes it all about herself, saying \"How could you do this to me?\" and making him promise he won\\'t kill himself. She NEVER listens to why he feels this way, or makes ANY attempt to try to help him or get him professional help. Honestly, this kind of reaction, while only making the situation worse by making the suicidal person feel shamed and pathetic, DOES happen in real life quite often. What I have a problem with is how the movie handles this. She apologizes later, and by the tone of the movie and her being so easily forgiven, it sends the message that this is an appropriate way to respond to learning someone is going to kill themself. The movie then pretends that just by saying he won\\'t kill himself, he\\'s magically fixed, and never again thinks about or attempts suicide. I wish I had known years ago that the only way to stop feeling suicidal is to just tell myself that I won\\'t do it! /s\\nSeriously, IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND WHO YOU THINK IS SUICIDAL:\\nDO NOT MAKE IT ABOUT YOURSELF. The only appropriate thing to do is to listen to them, and let them feel heard. Don\\'t threaten them, and do not blame them. They are already dealing with difficult feelings, by blaming them all you do is make them feel worse. Try to get them help. If they won\\'t accept it, be there for them as best you can.\\n*SPOILERS*\\nThis reappears later in the movie, when waifuchan- I mean Nishimiya- also tries to kill herself. She\\'s told that, \"Everyone has suffering, so you just need to accept the bad parts of yourself\". What bad parts does she even have? Her deafness, I guess? That\\'s more of a challenge than a character flaw. Anyways, this sentiment is equally as grating. Because, obviously, depressed people just need a lecture and they\\'ll see everything as sunshine and rainbows.\\nWhich is essentially how this movie ends. Ishida has a revelation, and his depression is cured! I don\\'t think the writers of this anime have struggled with mental illness. Getting better is a long, sometimes torturous process, that sometimes feels pointless. It\\'s slow, and takes a lot of work. Nobody just wakes up and suddenly their mental illness is gone.\\n*END SPOILERS*\\nArt - 5\\nIt\\'s KyoAni. Of course the art is going to be good looking. I wasn\\'t really impressed, though. There wasn\\'t anything creative about color use, or shot composition, or creative visual metaphors.\\nWell, there is one visual metaphor, but it\\'s a long stretch from \\'creative\\'. To show that Ishida doesn\\'t want to hear certain people, an X is placed over their face. I only found this extremely distracting. I know it\\'s a cliche at this point, but why not just black out their faces, or maybe have the camera angles shot in such a way to not show their faces?\\nOther than that, I didn\\'t really feel like there was much detracting, in the way of artwork. This isn\\'t exactly art related, but why did the anime hide the black guy for so long? It showed the rest of the family near the start of the movie, and Ishida\\'s brother-in-law is only shown at the end, as if it\\'s supposed to be some kind of funny revelation. What is funny about a character being black? I guess that\\'s Japan for you, but it felt kind of scummy.\\nSound - 4\\nI didn\\'t really notice the music, for the most part, which is kind of the problem. The music never added anything for me. I noticed in particular during one emotional scene that there was no music. Was that deliberate? Who knows!\\nThe voice acting was alright. Pretty standard anime fare. I was a little worried, going into this movie, that Nishimiya would go from not talking to having a perfect anime girl voice. I thought her voice was pretty convincing. I don\\'t think I\\'m the greatest judge, because I\\'ve only heard deaf people talk via TV shows, but I was convinced. I looked up the voice actress to see if she was actually deaf, because I thought she might be. (She wasn\\'t. I think it might have been better to have an actual deaf person, but I don\\'t think it\\'s too big of a deal)\\nCharacters - 2\\nOh boy, where do I start?\\nThe biggest problem I have with the characters in this anime is that they lack any depth. It was obvious there was an attempt to give them depth, but this creates what irritated me perhaps the most about this movie: The characters are only portrayed as completely good or completely bad depending on what the movie wants you to feel at that specific time. When the characters are supposed to be seen as \\'bad\\' they behave in completely disgusting ways. Then, later, the movie pretends they\\'ve gone through some kind of arch by having them apologize for it later, and never act that way again. I can excuse this in the case of Ishida- He\\'s grown up significantly, and has gone through enough suffering to develop empathy. But the others- Nishimiya\\'s mother and sister, and Kawai, for the most part- it just feels extremely fake.\\nIshida was probably my favorite character out of all of them, but that only means that I found him slightly less obnoxious and unbelievable than the rest of the cast. I understand why he does most of what he does, and his character is bland, but in a way I could see a real kid turning out. I don\\'t like that he never seems to take initiative and actually DO anything (Stand up to the one bully, tell his classmates who were bad-mouthing him to fuck off, go past the sister when she says he can\\'t see Nishimiya) but again, that\\'s the sort of issue I could understand a real teenager having.\\nNishimiya is what I like to call \\'waifu-bait\\'. She\\'s so bland, so vanilla, so forgiving, that most weeb viewers will want her merchandise and dakimakura. What are her interests? What does she do in her free time? Is there anything unlikable about her whatsoever? Can you answer these questions? I don\\'t think you really could. It feels like a deliberate choice on the part of the writers/ directors, in my opinion, to not give her any strong personality traits, so as to not alienate any viewers. It could be argued that they wanted to portray her sympathetically, to not make it seem like she\\'s unlikable because she\\'s deaf, I suppose. But as a pansexual man, the only gay characters who offend me are terribly written ones. I can\\'t speak for the deaf audience, but if I were deaf, I would be angry to be portrayed in such a mindless, creatively-dead way.\\nThen there\\'s Ueno. She\\'s straight-up a bitch. I don\\'t think they were even trying to show her as anything more than a mean, one-dimensional character. I know soooo many people in real life who are just mean for no reason, and never attempt to even think rationally. /s She only exists in this movie to be the villain, and nothing more.\\nI already kind of covered Nishimiya\\'s family. They go from completely unlikable to saints in the span of about ten seconds. I don\\'t really have anything more to say.\\nThe only other character I think it worth mentioning is the best friend character, Nagatsuka. (Did you remember his name? I sure didn\\'t!) He\\'s fairly annoying, although in the way I could sort of relate to. I\\'ve had loud, kind of weird friends before, and they\\'ve been some of the best friends I\\'ve ever had. So his involvement in the movie was maybe the only time I could see myself in the character\\'s shoes. I didn\\'t like the way he seemed very... comic-relief, I suppose? He would be saying very serious stuff, but I felt as though the movie didn\\'t want me to take him seriously. The way he was drawn was, I think, the biggest factor in this. He\\'s a fairly serious character in a pretty serious movie, and yet, KyoAni drew him as a blob. Between him and Haru from Accel World, I\\'m beginning to wonder if any of these animators have ever actually seen a fat person. As someone who has, having such an unrealistic character took me out of the movie somewhat. I might be the only person bothered by this, but oh well.\\nEveryone else is forgettable, in my opinion. One-dimensional background characters.\\nEntertainment - 2\\nI really felt like this movie felt very \\'anime\\'. It wasn\\'t trying to tell a good story, or trying to show its audience any nuance or complexity. It is made to sell merchandise. I honestly wish it had entertained me. I don\\'t go into shows thinking, \"Oh boy, I can\\'t wait to hate this show and drag down its MAL score!\" I wanted to like this movie. But when the story is so bland and the characters so inhuman and obnoxious, I just can\\'t.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd05244330f18165f6d01567e368da1cc'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I was lucky enough to catch the very first screening of Koe no Katachi in Singapore\\'s cinemas on March 9, 2017. This is also my first review, so please bear with me if my review layout is not great.\\nPlease also note that my review of this will be Anime-only, as I have not yet read the manga. I do plan on reading the manga to get the full experience though.\\nStory: 9/10\\n- The story starts off with a young girl named Nishimiya Shouko, who walks in to a classroom and introduced herself in pieces of paper she wrote before coming in, then \"I am deaf.\" was\\nwritten. Ishida Shouya and a few of his friends bullied her as her time in school goes by to the point where she had to be transferred out because they have been damaging her hearing aids -which is very expensive- and the teachers were suspicious of a potential bully in class. Shouya\\'s actions then turned onto him and he has to suffer almost the same fade of bullying as what he did to Shouko. Many years later, both of them met again. Regretting his actions, Shouya tries to make friends with her in hopes of trying to reconcile.\\nThis is a rather interesting story to me as not many manga/anime generally does not focus a story about a deaf character. It\\'s fairly genuine in the Anime community and I really applaud the setting and effort being put into the movie.\\nArt: 10/10\\n- As expected from Kyoto Animation, it has one of the most vibrant and smoothest animation one could get. Comparing this to Tamako Love Story, the quality is about the same, if not better.\\nSound: 7/10\\n- First of all I must say that the ending song \"Koi wo Shita no wa\" by aiko is flawless. However, there are instances where the sound does not seem to fit with it\\'s current scene/setting. Some of which threw me off in the cinema that I\\'d just prefer to watch it raw and without sound. Overall, there ARE still some music which really fits it\\'s current scene/setting, but it\\'s just that one or two sounds which were really unfit to be in there.\\nThe voice acting is spot-on; especially the Nishimiya sisters, which was actually the main reason why I watched the movie. Saori Hayami did a perfect-close-to-flawless job in performing as Shouko and Aoi Yuuki\\'s tone as Yuzuru is completely different from the other roles she took before this, which bewildered me because I almost thought that it\\'s a completely different person. Miyu Irino\\'s preformance is great as well.\\nCharacter: 8/10\\n- The only thing that left me a good impression while I was sitting in the cinema was Shouya\\'s development throughout the movie. He makes a major change to himself in order to reconcile with Shouko. I really love his change and one can really relate (especially people who regret bullying their victims) to how he\\'s doing his best to show his regret on his actions.\\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n- Throughout this sitting I\\'ve never fidget at all and my eyes were glued to the screen for the entire movie. Fidgeting a lot has been a habit for me when it comes to watching shows in cinemas and I was really surprised when the movie ended. Hence why I gave my enjoyment the fullest.\\nOverall: 10/10\\n- I\\'m not really a person who cries at a really touching scene but this movie takes the cake. It\\'s a very enjoyable movie to sit back and relax and I highly recommend people who do that to watch this.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '50c08381f472d41fdffd98a1e64972d4'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"How am I after watching this movie? Angry. This movie was fucking good and it's such a pity that it came out when Kimi no Na wa did, because it deserves so much more recognition. Honestly, I believe it outshines it tenfold but this is a review not a comparison so let me give you my points:\\n- Great soundtrack/art/animation/the works. solid base. if you like kyoani why are you waiting\\n- EXPERIMENTAL. The perspectives and aesthetics shown throughout the movie are insane. Like if you think of one of those 'aesthetic tumblr posts' the entire movie is literally in that vibe.\\n- The noise level. not the\\nmusic. the noise level- majestic. since koe no katachi is about living life as a deaf person most of the soundtrack is ambient noise, cute jingles or piano notes. It's quiet. But as soon as the action picks up and things get more intense the sound gets LOUD, in this huge juxtaposition of noise, on a greater scale than most anime take it. It's so good.\\n- Characters. Let's talk about that for a sec. I've only seen the original oneshot of the manga koe no katachi is based on, so I don't have a reference for what these characters could have been like, in for example, a theoretical anime series version of this movie. I don't know. But I can say for a movie with only 2 hours to spare it did pretty damn good to flesh out these characters as much as possible considering the size of the cast. We see 12 characters on the regular.\\n12 characters! (not just one-off, as regular appearing characters) and we know exactly who they all are. That's more than what I can say for a lot of movies and even anime out there. But naturally there is some bias. The two main characters bear the brunt of the character development (primarily our protagonist Shouya) and over time you can see a clear change not only in themselves but in their relationships. Characters don't 'learn a lesson' and change the next day. We're not talking about cheap development like that, in fact one of the more realistic things about koe no katachi is how each character's personalities stay the same but their values change. Everyone is trying the become a better person and clashing with everyone else by the end of it. It's gritty, it's messy, it's believable.\\n- As for story, Koe no Katachi is more of a 'let's put all these interesting characters together and see what happens' simulator than anything with a crazy, god-given plot. Suicide is a major theme and so is atoning for what you have done in the past. A bully is the main character, he picks on Nishimiya who is deaf, and the story starts from there. Everything past that is seen as a direct consequence of what happened back then, which eventually leads to the more suicidal themes as both main characters struggle with the realisation that many less people couldn't have been hurt if both of them had never existed. But this movie doesn't drone on. It's not preachy like that. Yeah, this movie will make you cry. But in a good way.\\nSo did I enjoy Koe no Katachi? Um clearly yes. Go for it, you've got nothing to lose except all of your tears.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '328ec71b2a1aea628010ac915012e67d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'A Silent Voice is a beautiful looking filmーlike most of Kyoto Animation’s productions. The artistic direction was on point, but that aspect of this creation doesn’t make up for the poorly constructed story. The story is about a bully making amends for beating and antagonizing a deaf girl as a child.\\n• That would be all fine and good, if the movie showed the recovery of the girl who got unjustly picked on and the bully helping her trust again, or something like that, but this film is all about THE BULLY making amends, so that he doesn’t feel like killing himself. The deaf girl’s\\npersonality is not explored whatsoeverーshe’s just the apologetic, cute, love interest.\\n• Yes, you heard me correctly. Love interest. The first time the characters meet after the time skip, the deaf girl (with good reason) runs away from him. But, once they meet again, she’s starts flirting with him? She forgives him? This guy ripped out her hearing aids, causing her ears to bleed, and threw away thousands of dollars worth of hearing equipment for this deaf girl and beat her for getting him in trouble.\\n• Saori Hayami does a good job at voicing a deaf girl, but the victim of the story, practically has no role other than to be a Mary Sue that apologizes constantly for being abused. It’s sickly reminiscent of the scene in Royal Space Forceーwhere the main heroine apologized for almost getting raped. I threw my hands up and almost quit midway through the movie because of that characterization of a sweet, deaf girl.\\n• To make things worse, the main character doesn’t just keep contacting her, but he brings the other bullies that used to hurt her along with him! Yeah, there’s a girl who used to be nice to her that comes along, too, and a fat guy that look’s like Deku if he gained two hundred pounds and serves absolutely no point in the story, except to make the protagonist look less creepy.\\n• The most well-written character was probably either Ueno or the deaf girl’s little sister. Ueno, while being a terrible person who had no right tagging along with the deaf girl after being awful to her, forcing her to apologize to her for “breaking up their friend group by snitching,” and beating her up, was one of the more fleshed out characters.\\n• Ueno’s character was refreshing, because she was a pretty girl that was ghetto trash and anime never does that! KyoAni did well at animating her mannerisms to look like she was a trashy, garbage can of a person and didn’t make her a moe copy/paste like most of their female characters. Sadly enough, Ueno (though unlikable) was far more realistic than the girl you’re supposed to be sympathizing with.\\n• The little sister wasn’t well-written eitherーseeing as she forgave the main character far too easily for all of the horrible shit he did to her sister and even seems to possibly like him? What is this, a fucking visual novel? And, she takes pictures of dead animals and posts them all over the house to... keep her sister from committing suicide? Why?\\n• I was seething throughout this whole movie though, if people thought Your Lie in April was melodramtic, this takes it to a new level. Seeing as the deaf Mary Sue hangs out with all of her bullies again, something bad is bound to happen. It was forced tension that didn’t need to be there. There were moments that were like, “Hey, let’s go to the amusement park with two of your bullies tagging along. Nothing can possibly go wrong!”\\n• As someone who was bullied pretty severely as a child and teenager, I would never EVER want to hand out with my bullies again, god forbid, have romantic feelings for one. It disgusted me that such a nice girl would be blaming herself for these awful people being unhappy, apologizing on her knees for something that was not her fault AT ALL, and even attempting suicide over it and then blaming herself when the protagonist falls while saving her.\\n• Overall, A Silent Voice is a movie that’s worth watching if you want to see pretty visuals, but other than that, no one should have to sit through this stupidity. It was hard watching a good person continually getting trauma heaped on her, for no good reason, while the asshole who hurt her gets to recover from the guilt of bullying her. It’s a bad movie and has bad messages in it.  I give it a 3/10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5f1c1af13499874d22696164b28e8063'}>,\n",

Maybe that\\'s just my harsh criteria.\\nCharacter - 9/10\\nI have to agree with most negative(ish) reviewers on this one. Aside from Mr. Main Character and Ms. Main Heroine, the side characters, save from Yuzuha, didn\\'t get much development. I was a little perturbed as to what each of their motives were. For example (not in the movie, so not a spoiler), I didn\\'t know that Nishimiya\\'s mother caught a virus during childbirth, resulting in her daughter being born deaf and her husband leaving her. I only learned that by reading the character description page on MAL. That, and other information, would have enhanced the movie as a whole. The little side stories is what Koe no Katach is lacking.\\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\nI was *this* close to crying, and I\\'m disappointed that I didn\\'t. This movie deserved it.\\nOverall - 10/10\\nBeing a high school student myself, I feel that Koe no Katachi struck home with me, having dealt with bullies and may have been a mild one in elementary school. It really puts into perspective how important it is to have respect for others and not be a total douchebag. Or else you\\'ll end up like Ueno, a distasteful, cold-hearted, jealous baka.

The story is vibrant and complex yet sometimes comes as vexing or frustrating, but in that sense it shows you the beauty and the sophistication of a simple story (and how it can be more than just simple).\\nStory: 8 out of 10; I really loved the show. I really can\\'t say much, but there were actual plot holes which I wish were never there. (I guess I really just have to buy and read the manga.)\\nArt and Animation: 10 out of 10; I LOVE KYOANI. Period.\\nSounds and Music: 10 out of 10; the sounds and the music were stunning. I felt moved after that last part of the movie. I had trouble holding back my tears, and part of that was because of the music.\\nCharacters: 9 out of 10; The characters may come eccentric and weak, but it\\'s a drama. What can I say? The characters were actually portrayed in a sensible and tangible manner and that makes them feel unique and alive - like real people.\\nEnjoyment: 10 out of 10; I personally LOVE dramas and emotional roller coasters. I love bawling my eyes out while watching even though I know it\\'s fiction. In short, rhetorically speaking - Koe No Katachi is right in my strike zone.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMy verdict: 10 out of 10\\nNOTE: I truly believe that Koe No Katachi deserves more praise than the actual praise it gets now. Watch Koe No Katachi in the theaters! Support KyoAni and Ooima Yoshitoki-sensei!

       "  <Document: {'content': \"I was super lucky to be able to see this in theaters the day this came out!\\nStory: 6/10 The story is a continuation of the Demon Slayer Anime that ended last year in 2019, being an adaptation of the Mugen Train Arc. You may recognize the main villain or demon of this arc from the first season, well you did see him. He was the the demon who Muzan had given his blood to, the one who wanted to be tortured. It closely follows the Manga's events, showing off Rengoku using his Sun Breathing Techniques, and all the fights. It feels bloated with fights\\nand not much else, but that's mostly the manga's fault. The movie does play out the emotional scenes quite well. Kimetsu no Yaiba was never big on the story aspect so it will be expected for the movie and any adaptations if they want to stick to the source material.\\nArt: 10/10: Once again, Studio Ufotable has knocked it out of the park with the breathtaking animation they have. But this time around it's even better with a movie budget. Its so smooth and satisfying that it just draws you in like that. The breathing techniques were the highlight of the First Season, and its the same for here. I have no idea how Studio Ufotable does it. With Tanjirou's breathing, the almost 3d looking camera angles, the fast paced movements, Nezuko's Exploding blood, Zenitsu's lighting, Inouske in all of his glory, its absolutely fantastic.\\nSound 7/10: Another amazingly great aspect. At times like that, I love being in a Japanese theater, because everybody is very silent, doesn't laugh at jokes or gasps, its a great expierence. The sound effects are pretty good, with the Voice acting being taken to the next level. But the real highlight in terms of the sound, is the amazing Musical Score. I said it once and I will say it again, Demon Slayer has one of the best orchestrated soundtracks in an Anime that I have ever seen. The low and melancholy piano keys, the tense and sharp violin, the soft and relaxing flute, the haunting chorus, it all comes together to make a amazing score.\\nCharacters: 6/10: Nothing really changed from the first season, with most characters sticking with their personalities. But at times it just feels like the second season of the anime and not a feature length film. I mean, its an exact adaptation so you expect it to be similar to the manga but its very similar to the source material and the previous Season. The constant yelling between the trio is very annoying, like the first season. Even when writing this review, I feel like I'm just reviewing the anime. The only thing that changed was the art but everything stays the same in terms of my thoughts on the anime.\\nEnjoyment: 8/10: I enjoyed the Demon Slayer Anime, but this, raised the bar even higher, I highly highly highly suggest watching this when it comes out on streaming services. Demon Slayer is shaping up to be another gigantic manga and anime series even if it might not deserve it fully. But if your a big fan of Shonen Jump or the second season, OR even the manga I would suggest watching it. But its not perfect, I think too many people have hyped up Demon Slayer, which can be bad when the ending eventually gets animated, because it will all come crashing down. But still good for the time being.\\nOverall: 8/10\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '60ec1469e08d0641ffb24540cde75f60'}>,\n",

It was sold out in advance with huge waiting list and it was clearly visible by the TOHO Cinemas Roppogi Hills where I was pleased to see this movie. Every available seat was taken and queue was HUGE.\\nNow, let's have a deeper look at the movie itself, there'll be some minor spoilers but if u haven't read the manga I strongly suggest to avoid them, they'll be marked.\\nSTORY: 7\\nI was never a big fan of KnY, it's pretty generic and\\npredictable shounen, but it was fun and enjoyable, up to some point, overall manga was really disappointed at the end and final arcs were to say least, weak. But it does't change anything, we're talking about the movie which adapted Mugen Train Arc and did it really, really good, giving justice to the manga and leaving audiences with an quality product.\\nTanjirou and his friends accompany Rengoku, the Flame Hashira on the mission to investigate unexplainable disappearances onboard the train. They don't yet know, that Enmu, one of the elite Twelve Kizuki demons is awaiting them with a trap. It's fast paced, darker and suprisingly close to the manga events, would say that the sligh changes made it even better.\\n[SPOILER] The sad and bitter ending was really powerful, leaving us speechless and very emotional. Done right, without forced sadness and fake emotions. And for that it ufotable has my thanks. [END SPOILER]\\nART: 10\\nIt's ufotable after all. And with huge movie pudget it's basically one big show off of magical skills of animators. We got to see Rengoku in action, with such a detail and precision, beautifully animated and blood pumping. Tanjirou showed even more of his techiques and is was pleasable, what's most important, the framerate and overall animation quality is superb, flawless. And yeah, we got to see more of Nezuko in action. The fights choreography is another ufo usual, amazing and smooth, with beautiful colors and movements. Designs were even sharper and planning and backgrounds were bloody well done. Mixture of ultramodern animation with static drawings and CGI is top notch. Orgy for the eyes.\\nSOUND: 10\\nAnd the sound is an orgy for the ears. Voicing is powerful and reliable, full of emotions and feels. Music on the other hand is once again an beautifully written mixture of classic japanese sounds and modern orchestration and arangations. Plus of course beautiful ending by LiSA hits straight into the heart.\\nCHARACTER: 6\\nWell, character development in KnY is just fine, nothing unexpected, pretty straightforward and predictable. But it is done right and without cringe, just your regular shounen show off. From the checkpoint to another checkpoint on the road to achieve goals and plans. But what stands out is a nice Rengoku introduction, his backstory and good explanation of his motives. Job well done.\\nENJOYMENT: 9\\nUfotable never disappoints when it comes to enjoyment, it's epic, fast and looks godly. And it looks godly af. Great combination of action, music and simple, but fair story makes very good impression and leaves with heart pumping faster. Like proper action flick, enjoy the show and leave no place for deeper thinking. Pure fun and action, strongly recommend to watch it at the biggest possible screen when it'll be released for streaming and bluray next year.\\nOVERALL: 8\\nAn very good movie, better than expected, satysfying and an visual diamond. Ain't the best action movie, but it's very much what action movie is supposed to be. Yeah, it has it's critics, I'm one of em, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying an great entertainment. Especially when it's done with highest possible quality. Great as an cure for the current situation, makes u forget for nearly 2 hours about reality. I recommend it of course for every fan of KnY as well as fans of good action flicks. It stands on entertaining the audiences and with bit darker notes it delivers as well bit deeper view and can make u emotional. An satysfying and ectremely well done movie. Even with it's typical shounen flaws and shorts. An job well done ufotable, thanx again.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3480880810a6ec95dcd60c2ab53dfb95'}>,\n",

Maybe I like this anime because I’ve been watching it since the first day it started airing but either way it’s perfect for me. People say it’s a simple story but they all forget almost none of the other shonens have complex story either. Naruto is trying to become hokage, Asta is trying to become wizard king, Deku is trying to become hero, Gon is trying to find his dad. Bleach is like yu yu hakusho 2.0, so is jujutsu kaisen.\\nSee? Demon slayer story is quite original compared to other shonens. Also if the only thing that carries demon slayer is animation then why aren’t god of high school or fire for so popular yet?\\nThis part contains spoilers about the movie:\\nAnyway let’s talk about the movie. Four main characters were the same as they were in season 1. Nezuko and Zenitsu scenes were so wholesome and satisfying to watch. But Rengoku really shined in this movie. He’s easily one of the best characters in the series, F. Enmu was ok, he is just unlucky to be the villain of the same movie as Akaza in it. Akaza is easily the best upper moon for me. His design, personality, backstory. Soundtracks were also amazing & so is the voice acting. Especially Tanjiro’s va did great job. His voice acting when Tanjiro was yelling at Akaza for escaping was impeccable & emotional, I was literally sobbing during that scene. Overall this movie was enjoyable and sad at the same time.\\nIt was 10/10 for me. Also congrats to Gotouge & Ufotabe for the movie’s box office revenue success.

The story actually flows and progresses each arc we get closer and closer to our end goal. The MC is actually really cool he may be pure and sympathetic, but he can get the job done without any sort of hesitation. Inosuke is pretty good, Zenitsu can be cool from time to time. Nezuko is a\\nreally great little sister, she isn't like your typical little sister in anime. Everyone else has their own quirk.

So it is not spoiler.\\nThe premise is pretty simple and retakes, of course, the last part of the anime. Since the whole adaptation is entirely loyal to the manga, I personally regard this, more than a movie, as an arc of the anime. There is no difference with everything that has been shown before in the series, and kind of it isn't a great closure, I mean, it ends even opener than the series. The only novelty is the first apparition of an upper moon (3th kizuki), who is actually my favourite kizuki, Akaza.\\nGoing back to the adaptation thing, that is something that turns KnY down, 'cause the mistakes are the mangaka's, Gotouge. All the debilities it has are originally from the manga, that's why I can't adjudicate this errors to the anime or the movie. They are doing the best they can with the material they have, and that's it, and that's something I respect. It's not like other animes where the problem is the director's adaptation and pacing choices.\\nThe story then, it's fine, not complex nor big deal, yet still attractive. Of course, there are plot armors that I'm not delving into right now. Pretty convenients, but I wasn't expecting another thing. It is not characterized by its master tier plots. Just a nice entertaining movie with flashy fights and some well-handled emotional moments that are very predictable; those were touching to me anyways. As I said, nothing new nor distinctive from the anime. I even dare to say that it's not as great as the anime since, by nature, KnY has many development errors (both story and characters) that in the 26 episodes can manage to slip by unseen, but in a movie, that it's a lot shorter, that's imposssible. However, it's pretty enjoyable.\\nIn terms of characters, both in manga and in movie, it still has its lacks. The first part of the fim is about a demon's blood technique that makes them fall asleep and introduces them in an infinite dream where they live in their own paradise; Tanjiro dreams of his family, Inosuke dreams of himself as a big leader, Zenitsu, of course, dreams of a girl. And Nezuko, logically, did her part as the cute relief of the movie. The purpose is to kill them in their dreamworld. As always, in flashbacks (or dreams lmao) is kind of the only way they find to construct a background or a development for a character. It works for me, but is a poor resource if it is used all the time. This is somewhat sad, because, even though a movie is not long enough to create a big depth (specially in a shounen), there could have been more character's exploration. Or at least, please, ZENITSU, STOP CRYING AND FIGHT WHILE BEING AWAKE. In resume, won't witness any character changes, at least not noticeable.\\nLater, we have the beloved Rengoku, a character that acts as the trigger that every shounen protagonist needs. Is, in my opinion, a wasted personage that could have taken this as an opportunity to be developed, since in the series the viewer barely knows his name and his breathing technique as a hashira. His only background is, again, through flashbacks. By the very end you get to see a little bit more things about him that can tell what kind of person he is. But, to me, it wasn't enough. I appreciate him tho.\\nI want to stop for a moment just to say how amazing Akaza is and how regrettable it is the way he is presented and disappear. His seiyuu, the dear Akira Ishida, made me explode. I couldn't expect less from him; when I knew he was voicing this demon, I screamed as the cringey fangirl I am. The other demon present in the movie, the main one, Enmu, is completely plain with no minimum exploration, and even is weak and ridiculous. It's the typical sadistic crazy character whose unique objective is to spread blood al over the place. That's a pointless villain that could have been replaced for another a lot better, given it is a film.\\nIn animation, of course, no complaints at all since it is this franchise's strongest point. This is an Ufotable top tier animation, amazing in every possible way. Character designs are a lot better than the manga's, so that's another point. Fights are excellent, exciting without a doubt, and the sound is even better. LiSa is the best thing that ever happened to KnY. From a technical point of view, this is a masterpiece. Shamefully, that's a great part of KnY's success, and that's not enough to cover its debilities. Thank god this was made by Ufotable, otherwise this would have been another unnoticed anime.\\nIn conclusion, as a shounen movie that covers just one arc of a fairly long story, is very decent and enjoyable, and for the anime fans or manga readers, this is orgasmic. I myself enjoyed this a big time, because despite all the holes and lacks it has, this story won my heart and the characters did as well. I'm aware of the loosen details, but that didn't detract me at all from my feelings. A story doesn't need to be a 10 for it to take root in me. That's what Kimetsu no Yaiba is.\\nAgain, if you didn't like the main story or you couldn't stand the errors and weakness in the series, do not watch this, because if you have expectations for this to change anything, it won't.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Had the privilege of seeing this in Cinemas. And as such I didn't have the opportunity of pausing it every few seconds to talk about how I feel,but I still have some things to say.\\nFirstly, what I'd give the movie overall, it's a clean 70/100.\\nI put the rating first so it'll be easier for me to explain why.\\n- Story: 6/10\\nI would say hear me out on this, but I'm pretty sure that the general consensus on this series' story is that it is just basic af.\\nThe movie is no different since, well, it's still adapting the same story.\\nThere's nothing innovative, nothing new being done\\nbut it ain't bad, it just isn't special either, hence the score.\\n- Characters: 7/10\\nI'm actually willing to give this higher/lower depending on who I'm talking to.\\nFor a generic shonen buff, the characters are awesome. You have inspiring trope, the brave and unwavering MC and two quirky supporting characters. For someone of my taste, it's plain. Not bad, again, just plain. Characters in KnY can be found in almost every single action shonen so it doesn't really stand out to me.\\nHowever, I do think that the characters in this show are way more sympathetic, and one spoiler scene in the movie got me a little down. So, yea its generic but slightly better.\\n- Animation: 10/10\\nHands up everyone who saw this coming. No fucking shit it's gonna get a 10 for animation.\\nUfotable outdid themselves when they aired the TV series last year, and they outdid themselves this year again with this movie. This shit hits different when seen on the big screen - the colours, the drawings and the fight scenes are truly something to be marveled at.\\nI cannot for the life of me stress how amazing the animation is and can't ever express my thanks to everyone on the art team for this show. It is simply one of the most crisp animations and art styles I've ever seen.\\n- Direction : 4/10\\nOne of the few negative points of the movie to me. The direction of this show is simply not good.\\nMany, many many repetitive shots of whatever the story is trying to emphasize. E.g 3 overhead shots in the span of 5mins during the last arc of the movie.\\nVery predictable directions as well due to the previous point, to the point where I can already tell what's going to happen without actually having any prior knowledge.\\nLastly, there was nothing innovative. The adaptation feels like a flat out copy-paste of the manga pages, a lot of important stuff were omitted/not explained, making it super super hard for anyone who hasn't seen the original series to keep up. And before I get clowned for this, it's marketed as a movie so it's clearly meant for first-timers as well as returnees. A good example of a movie with good backstory explanations/summary is Detective Conan. No matter which movie it is, it always begins with a brief backstory to help newcomers familiarize. This is how you do marketing for a movie that can be enjoyed by both parties.\\n- Music 4/10\\nLastly, and sort of least, the music. Nothing particularly interesting here.\\nThey practically repeated Kamado Tanjiro no Uta in like 3 different versions throughout the impactful scenes in the movie - we have a Hum version, a la-la-la version and bits of the original. That's all.\\n- Conclusion\\nI have a slight love/hate relationship with this show. On one hand, I do not think it does anything particularly special on the outside.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I watched the movie in cinema yesterday.\\nThere will be spoiler in this review.\\nThe first part of the movie was boring in my opinion. We have Tenjiro and gang meeting Rengoku on board the Mugen train to investigate demon slayers that had gone missing. It was ok at first whereby they had to fight two demons on board the train. However, it got boring when they had the dream sequences whereby we get to see the dreams of each of them as they are put under a spell.\\nThis part of the movie really did not make senses to me. They had these kids tie ropes to\\nTenjiro and gang’s wirst so as to enter their dream to destroy their soul’s core. I mean seriously, tying ropes to each other allows one to enter another’s dream?! The reason these kids agreed to assist the demon in destroying Tenjiro and gang’s soul was because they themselves want to have dreams?!\\nThis makes no sense.\\nThe train derailed of the tracks in the middle of nowhere. We are told that all 200 passengers survived. However they mysteriously all disappeared off screen in the next scene when the final boss demon appeared. Passengers who are injured and the elderly and children all just disappeared to make way for the final fight.\\nThan we have the fight with the final boss demon. Who managed to get his arm caught inside the body of Rengoku, managed to escape in what was the longest sun rise ever in anime history so as he is able to make his getaway. We than have a lame scene of Tenjiro shouting and crying his heart out in trying to defend the honor of Rengoku, not to mention loosing his katana by hurling onto the final demon boss.\\nDemon slayer Mugen train is all style with no substance.\\nThis movie feels like a filler episode.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '40562883bf2eed9a445d31f92dd166b7'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'As this review is meant to be as spoiler-free as possible, do note that I will be unable to dig deeper into some of the themes and aspects of this movie that I personally enjoyed. Please do not let my own opinion dissuade you if you thought more highly of this movie or is interested in watching it yourself.\\nStory – 6.5/10\\nFrankly speaking, the movie was pretty linear and straightforward in presenting itself and is mostly just a direct continuation of the original anime series, the story it brought to the table was frankly speaking very normal and was more so elevated by the quality of\\nthe fights and the progression, thought process and dialogue of characters like Rengoku and Tanjiro who were able to elevate the quality and level of this movie. Though the story itself was very standard, the quality of its other key aspects have managed to pull up the score by a fair margin. As I have not read the original source material, I will be unable to provide insight as to whether or not the story has been faithfully adapted so if you have already read the manga, you’ll have to be your own judge as to how well the story was adapted.\\nCharacter - 7/10\\nI’ll go through the cons first, I personally dislike Zenitsu and Inosuke. Their antics are unbearable to me and once again this problem remains unsolved. Inosuke at the very least has made me feel that he has grown in some ways but Zenitsu and Nezuko’s development as characters leave much to be desired. Tanjiro’s growth was substantial enough for me but I think the most obvious stand-out would be the Flame Hashira, Rengoku. In the sheer span of a hundred and sixteen minutes (probably much less actual screen time), he has managed to outdo Zenitsu, Inosuke and Nezuko’s development over the course of countless hours. This was definitely the definitive highlight for this movie and I strongly stand by my opinion on the fact that this movie could’ve had an even greater peak if Rengoku had received more screen-time during the airing of the First season. Its quite a shame that I was only able to give the Character aspect a mere 7, due to the lack of development for 2 key characters (Nezuko and Zenitsu).\\nAnimation – 10/10\\nIf there was one sentence I could use to describe the phenomenal use of animation, it would be “Episode 19 on drugs”.\\nI’ve been an UFOtable fan since 2017 and that has not changed. Their ability to elevate the level of any source material they have been given is unmatched and this movie only goes to show their prowess in the animation department, especially when given a strong and healthy budget. The use of 3D camera movement figuratively makes you rock hard and there’s no better way to describe it. Animation will never be your problem when it comes to any UFO adapted anime and is the reason why I’m so hell-bent set on completing this series in anime form because the manga would most likely disappoint me in some key aspects when it comes to the shounen genre. Anything touched by UFOtable simply turns to gold. (Fate/Stay Night 2004 vs Fate/Stay Night UBW 2014 is a fair comparison to show how much a series can level up with the Midas Touch of the mighty UFOtable)\\nSound - 8/10\\nI’m inexperienced when it comes to the genre of music so do note that this is what my untrained ears personally thought. The soundtracks used were mostly fairly well-done, Yuki Kajiura’s composition rarely fails to please me and I am once again sold by her music. The ending soundtrack sung by LiSA delivered as well, albeit less catchy as compared to the likes of Gurenge due to the more solemn tone used in this song. Sound effects for the battle scenes and everything in general felt solid, no complains here.\\nEnjoyment – 8/10\\nSucks that I’m unable to go further in-depth to avoid spoiling anyone but I can say that I definitely did enjoy my time in the cinema and definitely did have a great time watching this movie, it’s definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the first season.\\nOverall – 8/10\\nDefinitely a much more pleasant experience that the first season. I gave the first season a 6.5/10 so I think this alone tells you that there has been a significant upgrade in the literary themes that it has presented and overall, is a solid watch to engross and indulge yourself with.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '99d9da57d42b41b97d608b8457504eed'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'If you love cats like I do, then immediately stop reading this review and go watch. For the rest of you, proceed to the next paragraph.\\nChi’s Sweet Home is like the Nintendo Wii of anime. Anyone of all ages can enjoy it: your sister will like it, your mom will like it, even your grandma will like it, if she’s into anime and is cool like that.\\nStory\\n-----------------------\\nThe story is pretty clear-cut. A cute kitten named Chi gets lost and separated from her mother, and a human family that lives nearby finds her and decides to adopt her. Unfortunately, pets are not allowed in the\\napartment complex, so the Yamada family must keep Chi out of sight, especially from the landlady. The third quarter of the 104 three-minute-long episodes gets kinda repetitive and filler-ish, but once you get over this small hurdle and reach the last quarter of the anime, you’ll remember why you stuck with this series for so long. Chi’s Sweet Home is not only entertaining, but enlightening for future cat owners like me. It’s like an animated pet manual. I had no idea about some of the things I’d have to go through while owning a cat, until I watched this anime.\\nAnimation\\n-----------------------\\nSome people may complain that more shadows or a darker color palette should’ve been used, but I think the watercolor style reminds me of a children’s book, which complements well with the innocent atmosphere of this anime. The animation stays very true to the manga’s design. Actually, if you were to set them side-by-side they would look almost exactly alike.\\nSound\\n-----------------------\\nThe OP theme with Chi the cat singing the lyrics is cute, but odd, to say the least. Even I wouldn’t be caught listening to it on my MP3 player -- and that’s coming from a person who likes Figu@Mate. XD The only thing I can compare the OP theme to is Menchi the dog howling the ED theme of Excel Saga (which is ironic, because it’s sung by the same voice actress). As for Chi’s ED theme…what ED theme? Lol. The rest of the music is standard and bubbly, but in a good way. Simple music for a simple anime. Most of all, I gotta give huge props to Satomi Koorogi for doing such a great job with Chi’s voice. Many times I thought they used a real cat!\\nCharacter\\n-----------------------\\nThe characters don’t have much depth, except the main star, Chi, of course. The parents and the little boy are mainly there to serve their role of caring for and disciplining Chi. Yet, the Yamada family does grow on you. Soon they will feel like distant relatives or close neighbors.\\nEnjoyment\\n-----------------------\\nI’ve never said “kawaii” so many times in an anime. This anime is very funny, which may be hard for you to believe until you see for yourself. Chi’s facial expressions and the way she reacts to her owners are simply priceless. This anime isn’t all about comedy, though. It is also suspenseful when Chi is at risk of getting caught, and there are some sad moments where I couldn’t help myself from saying “Poor Chi,” or “Poor Dad.”\\nOverall\\n-----------------------\\nUnless you totally hate cats or are allergic to uber kawaiiness, you should give this anime a try. Even though it’s a hefty 104 episodes, the series is only a little over 5 hours in length. Heck, even if you have 30 minutes to spare, you can zip through the first 10 episodes to see if you like it. In my opinion, Chi’s Sweet Home is the best anime about a pet. It’s suitable for all ages, and you may even learn a few things about cats.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '72de17e799dcb698ef9b04dbf5dbbdf9'}>,\n",

This anime is to make you shout &quot;KAWAII&quot;, it doesn't have a complicate plot.\\nArt:\\nThe art is linear, clear and chibish for the most characters, Chi in the first place, but also humans; it fits well the kind of this show. Expressions are so funny, believe me they'll make you laugh\\nand enjoy yourself while watching.\\nSound:\\nIt also fits quite well the animation, and though there isn't so much outstanding background music, there are often carillons' sounds, or funny music to fit funny scenes. The opening song (there's no ED) is cute and childish enough to make you melt.\\nCharacters:\\nChi is sooooo sweet, and everybody of you must at least agree with that. Also every other character shown is friendly. All the humans shown at the time I'm writing are pretty funny themselves. I'm really glad nobody hurt the little Chi, elseway it would have also hurt my heart.\\nEnjoyment:\\nHer story might turn out being something funny, sad or sweet, it's too early to say that.

Basically the plot is simple for anyone to understand in a heartbeat.\\nArt: What I found interesting is that the animation company behind the anime was Madhouse(The company who also did Deathnote and Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro), so I kinda expected some good clear movements and good artstyle. Which I did find and was happy for.\\nSound: This is where I think CSH shines. Chi's voice is done by Satome Koorogi(Who has also done supporting roles like Menchi from Excel Saga and Nina from FMA) so I was\\nkind of expecting a sweet cute voice that wasn't too high pitched. Her voice is just adorable from her normal talking as Chi to when she plays around with other objects in the house. The opening I have to add is also quite catchy. Problem is that it's short, like thirty seconds short.\\nCharacter: Chi as a character overall is great. A young kitten curious of how life works in the apartment and the way of living in it is just plain cute. From mistaking her litter box for a bed to believing the word wee was her name. As for other characters there isn't much to say. The humans just are well there and set up the scenario for Chi's actions.\\nEnjoyment: This series is bound to make either laugh or just blow you away with it's cuteness. You really have fun watching this series and just can't wait for the next episode to happen and see what funny thing Chi does next.\\nOverall: If you want a series to just give you a good laugh or if you're a cat fanatic I recommend it to you.

I was even more excited to learn that it had 104 episodes!\\n...Unfortunately these 104 episodes are around 3 minutes, and not your typical 20-something.

The anime is basically the adventures of a cute kitten doing cute things in her cute new home. Again, like I said, this show is CUTE. There's nothing really magical or supernatural about\\nit. More, its the slice of life of being a curious young kitten interacting with her new family and an unfamiliar world. Anyone who has had a kitten can account for both their massive bravery and massive cowardice that go humorously hand and hand, and this is well on display in Chii's Sweet Home.\\nThe art is okay, mostly just servicable to the cute somewhat mascot-like design they've created for the titular character.

It\\'s really great how one three minute episode can leave you rolling on the floor with laughter and the next will have tearing at your hair at anticipation.

It is also nice to see Mayama back in a period when he is still a college student. Packed with action and comedy, this episode may at first feel lacking\\nin any revelations or insights compared to other episodes in the anime, however Takemoto's narration near the end draws you to reminisce about the insecurity brought forth by adolescence, once again reminding me why this is one of the best slice-of-life anime out there.\\nChapter F is split into two shorts, but they are not cut explicitly as there is a tie-in of the first half into the second. The first half is a glimpse into life at Fujiwara Design before Mayama's time. More screentime was given to Yamasaki's and Miwako's relationship, which I find immensely enjoyable, not just because of the laughs but also that we get to know Yamasaki better as a character, who I feel has been sorely neglected amid the large cast in H&C. The second half we see lives of the usual gang at the art college after school, strung by a conversation between Mayama and Hanamoto-sensei. I thought this is an excellent short as it touches on many themes in H&C (unrequited love, misunderstandings and time) among its jokes, and manages to include bits of every character. Special mention must be made about the reference to Yamada's impression of Mayama being fickle at the start of the series, which is explained in this short, something I hadn't expected and was pleasantly surprised (it took me a while to recall this scene from the original anime, as it seems insignificant then). Also, the two men's frustration with the amount of time they spent in a standstill on Japanese chess in the end reminds me of Takemoto's concern of himself going nowhere while the wheel of time moves on; I may be over-thinking it, but I think it is a great symbolism.\\nIn short, if you enjoy the allusions to the emotions in adolescence in the original Honey and Clover, then this is definitely a bonus you will enjoy. You get to see Takemoto in the short, disheveled hair he sports at the beginning of the anime, and revisit both versions of the OP and the two EDs.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"This is a spoiler-free review.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is a rather unique watch. Shows throughout time have had a tendency to force characters from 0 to a 100 in an unrealistic time frame. This often pertains to the widespread demands of instant gratification. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar challenges these demands by emphasising the natural growth of characters: step by step characters are built through every interaction with the plot. Closely observing this and the plot is paramount as to not miss the abundance of implicit detail dedicated to their development and characterisation. Due to this profound nature of the show, reflection is commonplace\\nand as such, the watch is recommended for anyone who enjoys reading pensively into things.\\nAn inherent feature of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its large main cast. There’s a greater emphasis on characterising and developing the group as opposed to the individuals; however, it is decently balanced between the group and the individuals such that neither don’t feel completely neglected; the viewers are briefly enlightened on their individual daily lives (roles, recreation, style of living etc.) and personalities. This opportunity to learn about how each character interacts with the group is one of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar best point. Note this orientates Hai to Gensou no Grimgar more towards those who are interested in group development.\\nThe show starts off on a weaker foot but eventually progresses superbly, making it worth the watch if the initial set of annoyances can be endured. Such is also true for the pacing, as it evolves into superbness. Though, it is sometimes deemed ‘slow’, but slow is not bad. It is only when it is incongruously or meaninglessly slow it can be considered such. In this case, the creators have done a superb job at pacing the show such that the story and characters (development and characterisation) are often progressing and the right mood is established. Also, the isn't show is absolutely slow. Explicitly it might seem so but when explored implicitly, there is profoundness behind most interactions and moments (plot-wise and character-wise). Bluntly put, the show might seem slow or idle if one focuses on the explicit details and misses all the implicit detail, which is possibly consequential of not understanding the purpose of the show (detailed later).\\nNow regardless of the pacing, it is possible for something to be rushed. To rush something is to reach something without having the necessary details or time for the viewers to follow or agree with the outcome. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is subject to such with the limitation of 12 episodes. This is especially pertinent to an important moment that coalesces some of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar major elements. Whether or not its failure can be pardoned (if it is viewed as such) will ultimately dictate one’s enjoyability of the show. It has been identified and explained it in the spoiler section.\\nHai to Grimgar's paramount feature is its realism. The characters will have to manage basic needs, such as food and shelter. The characters will have to face the reality of the world. The dialogue, development, and interactions are all seemingly realistic. One example of such realism is the fact almost nothing major happens at the beginning. Though why should anything extraordinary happen? They lead basic lives and hold little significance. It is abnormal for much to happen outside of their daily struggles. Another excellent feature Hai to Gensou no Grimgar employ is not having over-the-top combat abilities. They were mostly just minor extensions of the human ability, which harmonises well with its realism theme.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is tailored to fans of slice of life. The combination of realism and narrative focus on character lifestyle and relatively slower progression makes it a natural watch for such people. A conspicuously common issue is approaching this show expecting an action, most likely consequential of the initial action scenes and seemingly shounen setup, and receiving a slice of life instead. It is also important to note that while the premise of the show was to toss the average teenager into a fantasy-themed world, it is not a deconstruction of the fantasy genre—the show lacks the focus on and the necessary intricate details characteristic of a deconstruction to be considered such—and is only one of its enjoyment factors. The watch is instead for those who are interested watching the growth of a group, the bonds they develop, the building of the character etc. It is much more of a character oriented show (60–70%) than a plot oriented one (roughly 35%). It is a show where learning about the characters is essentially progression. Understanding this and what a slice of life entails is critical when encountered with such works.\\nStory=7.7\\nCharacter=8.1\\nArt=9\\nThe art was dazzling at most times. The beautiful scenery heavily complemented the story by aiding the development of the desired mood. Most noticeably, the watercolour backgrounds evoked a tranquil slice-of-life feel, similar to that of Mushishi. The backgrounds were also unobtrusive allowing a higher focus on the projected characters, which is excellent because Hai to Grimgar is a character-dominated show. However, this conflicted with the action scenes as the projection of the background with 2D art instead of 3D sometimes lacked stimulation, detracting from its thrill.\\nSound=9\\nMy praise for the audio component is similar to that for the art. Furthermore, Hai to Grimgar uniquely features many montages. They aided the conveyance of the mood and story and were fairly enjoyable to watch. There were however two misuses. They have been mentioned almost immediately below as to avoid spoilers.\\nThis section henceforth contains spoilers. This section will offer the main criticism and other comments regarding the show.\\nIts first use (town settling) was inappropriate. It is only warranted once the characters have truly settled in, which was not the case.\\nThe second use (graveyard location) clashed with the mood. The pacing of the song was too fast inhibiting focus on the melancholy scene. The usage of the scene also felt extremely abrupt as Manato’s time with them was seemingly short.\\nShihoru is a frivolous character. She can be removed from the show with slight amendments and little difference. This was most apparent during episodes 1–5. She was, however, vital in combat post-episode 5. They need to rework her such that she serves a purpose (plot-wise) outside of combat.\\nDue to the limitations of 12 episodes, the development of the bond between Manato and the group is rather lacking. 2 episodes were certainly insufficient for evoking the desired sympathy for the characters grieving Manato’s death. The end of episode 4 is the weakest of the series (somewhat rushed outcome) as it draws heavily on Manato’s bond with the group. Common sense dictates that they were distraught but it is rather limited and superficial. This foundation of knowledge would have also fostered understanding of and sympathy for Haruhiro as he confronted his inner-conflict.\\nMore application of the characters is desired; while Hai to Gensou no Grimgar does build the character, they lacked the time to further display the final product. This was most evident in episodes 11 and 12 where new details were introduced to the character but without application. This plays into the 12-episode limitation.\\nIt was exasperating when Haruhiro uttered ‘It would be nice if you could mend clothes with magic as well.’ and proceeded to blatantly explain it. It seemed as if that line was attributed to him solely to inform the viewers. While it was natural, the interpretation should have been somehow left to the viewers.\\nRanta escaping at the end was illogical. He was surrounded and barely knew the mine’s caving system as opposed to the Kobolds, which know the place inside-out. Haruhiro’s skill is essentially the visualization of that.\\nExperience from fighting enemies will yield knowledge about their weak points and effective engagement. The streams of light that direct Haruhiro can be interpreted as the visualization of that. However, this ‘skill’ should have not appeared or appeared so quickly against the Death Spots at the end. As he lacked combat experience specific to Elder Kobalds, it should have been a challenge not something his ‘skill’ could easily relieve him from. It was an opportunity where the creators could have explicitly and satisfyingly displayed the development Haruhiro’s combat abilities and maturity over the course of the show. However, it was wasted by rushing the fight to a conclusion.\\nOther comments:\\nThey actually fully (and superbly) developed the concept of the main cast being unnatural inhabitants of the world. The main cast were evidently briefly aware of this fact, but overtime the characters neglected it such that it eventually faded. This suggests of their adaption to the world and prioritisation of their survival in the realization of the triviality of pursuing such an oddity as opposed to meeting to the demands of their daily lives; the corroboration follows. At the utter end, Kikkawa (the drunkard) shouted ‘Australia’ in a carefree manner. They could have chosen any word or omitted it all together, but why did they attribute that specific line to him? They deliberately chose ‘Australia’ to connect it with the real world and had Kikkawa, the most carefree character, utter it in such a manner to hint their accordance with and acceptance of the new world. Also, when heard in the context of the characters, the statement sounds greatly insignificant, as it was randomly blurted out by a drunkard, suggesting the same of their unnatural inhabitation of the world.\\nIn conclusion, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar deserves an 8/10, which accordingly to MAL denotes a ‘very good’ show.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '85561ac16daa1c15091cf8e3396f9ae3'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The occasional RPG setting within an anime isn\\'t some new, revolutionary trend. Popularized by the underwhelming Sword Art Online, they seem to be popping up a lot more frequently than before and that isn\\'t something I\\'m particularly fond of. This is mostly due to the lack of originality that comes with these works. To a novice, this idea may seem spectacular on it\\'s own, but at this point, the same thing has been done over and over again and not once did I consider one of them to be good.\\nWith that being said, I believe that this is quite close to the epitome of\\nwhat an anime should not be - from the embarrassingly awful execution to the completely obnoxious and meaningless characters. It honestly baffles me that some people see this title as average, yet alone good. From the legendary A-1 Pictures who\\'ve produced such magnificent works of art such as - Sword Art Online, The Asterisk War, The Perfect Insider, Fairy Tail, every single bad light novel adaptation and many more mind-boggling series for our entertainment over the years, comes the awe-inspiring Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash.\\nSo the story takes place in a videogame setting, a town called Grimgar and it follows our protagonists as they each individually grow as people, go through hardships together and face the cruel reality that 10 of them can\\'t kill 1 retarded goblin. This is not an exaggeration, our protagonists are so weak that it takes them 5 minutes to kill a single goblin. However, I thought this was a very interesting approach, as it obviously differs from the usual Jesus-kun format. Sadly, this doesn\\'t last for long. There was no big transition in between their entire party not being able to kill a single goblin to them doing full-on raids versus an entire castle full of goblins. It just sort of happened overnight, I don\\'t know.\\nWhile I did think it was a neat change, I see this argument used way too often. \"Grimgar is special because its story is very realistic unlike the other RPG anime!\" I think there is a fine line between realistic and different. A different approach doesn\\'t mean the title is going to be good and this is what people tend to be missing. If it really wanted to be that realistic then it should have cut down a bit on stuff such as discussing a girl\\'s breasts in front of her for 3 minutes straight. Here lies the thesis and basically anything the positive reviews ever say about this show. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if eventually people started calling it a deconstruction of the RPG genre for this sole fact.\\nThe world of Grimgar itself is for the most part very uninteresting and leaves a lot to be desired. It is barely touched upon within the first 2 episodes in some hasty introduction to the basics and the rest of the series is action-driven and focuses more so on the characters. All we know is that there are normal townsfolk and these adventurers who have to fight off goblins in order to survive. We don\\'t know anything about the town, we don\\'t know anything about the goblins, etc. Basically we don\\'t really know much of anything and it would of definitely been better if they tried to implement some sort of interesting lore and went more in detail since it just felt lazy on it\\'s own. Not that I find RPG settings to be particularly interesting anyway but yeah, the worldbuilding was bad.\\nSome people may tell you that this anime is simply not for you though, due to it\\'s slow pacing which a shonen fanboy such as yourself cannot appreciate. As a fan of shows that take their time in properly developing it\\'s world, themes and characters, I can safely say that Grimgar left me disappointed. It really did not have to be as slow as it was. It just felt like a mere blunder on the production staff\\'s side, rather than a necessity for good development. So even if you do prefer slower paced stuff, I can\\'t really guarantee you\\'ll enjoy Grimgar.\\nSo instead of filling up the weaknesses of the show, they go ahead and introduce irrelevant plotpoints such as: none of the characters having their memories from the real world. I thought this was incredibly useless and stupid, what would knowing anything change? Was this implemented in here just so they could have an easy way out of dealing with character backstories? It is shown early on that none of their items from the real world are transported here to begin with, so why bother? Actually why even bother making the setting a game? Why not just some fantasy world? It\\'s because A-1 knows the demographic it\\'s appealing to far too well.\\nOkay, gotta give credit where credit is due. The artstyle used in Grimgar is very original and nice, with a watercolor/painterly feel to it. This was definitely a breath of fresh air due to how bland I thought most of the art in these recent seasons looked like so a change of pace was much appreciated. The backgrounds look especially nice, as if you\\'re looking at a painting of some sort. The animation is alright and it clearly excels when the girls\\' tits bounce. You can just see how much time and effort was put into those jiggles.\\nUnlike the art and animation, the sound isn\\'t anything spectacular. Sure, you\\'ve got some good songs thrown in there, but for every good song you have the same amount of poor utilization and engrish vocals. This is quite a problem as Grimgar tries rather hard to make you emotionally invested, and when such scenes came along, they mostly felt underwhelming due to the mediocre musical direction. For a series that takes itself seriously, I thought the voice acting was rather lackluster. None of the performances stand out and most are just borderline annoying. The only decent performances were Yume, Mary and Haruhiro (although this is probably my bias due to his role as Shichika in Katanagatari).\\nAll aboard the cringe train. This is no doubt the worst part about Grimgar, showing further how A-1 has no clue how to make decent or even half-decent characters. This luckily changes as the series progresses but I still felt like touching upon it - every character interaction between members of the opposite sex has sexual themes or implications in it which makes me wonder if the writer is out of his early teens yet. Adding on to this, it is very impressive when in the first scene of the series it is able to portray the females as useless and clumsy damsels in distress, unable to do anything on their own apart from scream and cry until their beta-male white knight companions come to the rescue. This makes for some of the cringiest scenes I have ever seen, like talking about Shihoru\\'s breasts for a good 3-5 minutes.\\nYou could say that this is just taking the easy route since no matter how bad the actual series in question may be, it\\'s bound to garner some sort of audience. However, I still feel as though it is a very big problem and is ultimately what a lot of modern anime suffer from. While I guess that it just knows what demographic it\\'s appealing to and it\\'s not so bad on it\\'s own, it also means that we have to depend on the male cast to be good or get the proper development. Feel free to take a guess on how it\\'s handled in Grimgar. Yes, not very good...\\nA lot of people would argue this point because of how well developed they all become upon facing loss! No! The characters can grieve all they want but it won\\'t make them more likable or realistic. Coping with sadness is a great characterization tool if utilized properly and on good characters, but despite these characters being borderline terrible, they barely develop! Most of the characters don\\'t even have a personality that defines them to begin with, apart from Ranta. And, well.. Ranta is just Ranta.\\nFor example, one of the characters was only memorable for his death, nothing else. They didn\\'t even bother to make us feel anything for the character, he was just a bland teenager who got killed off in order to \"develop\" everyone else. You aren\\'t supposed to remember a character for their death, you\\'re supposed to remember them by their life and their accomplishments BEFORE their death. The drama also felt awfully forced and doesn\\'t work 90% of the time. \" Hey guys, let\\'s go to that place where most of Mary\\'s party got brutally murdered which left her scarred for life :D :D :D Oh Mary why u mad bro?? \"\\nI giggled a couple of times when the goblins were screeching so I guess some enjoyment was to be had. Sadly it was all just nullified by Ranta and the female cast\\'s cleavage. The pacing also played a key factor in this but it did get noticeably better as the series went along. Despite this, it is not an exaggeration to say that I was forcing myself through most of the show as in the end, Grimgar struck me as incredibly bland and boring.\\nThis is a series that had a lot of initial potential and sounded pretty good on paper but A-1 went the wrong way of doing it. Especially if the characters were handled properly, Grimgar could of been the highpoint of the RPG genre, covering stuff like how detrimental loss can be in some cases. Sadly, the script looks like something from an otaku\\'s basement, the pacing and execution are incredibly poor and the characters are very bland, uninteresting and have no defining personality.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd04a7cd59a6512363c134fa9f12093c7'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\\n--\\n(If you couldn’t give a tuna glass about this review and just want to know if you should watch this, skip all the way to the “What to expect and enjoyment” Either way, read this review if you want an insight of the flaws it had. This is my first review so don’t judge and give me a break lol. My usage of words might come off as wonky so sorry for that)\\nGrimgar is an anime that doesn’t necessarily bring anything distinctive to the tables. I personally believe that Grimgar was just an anime of progression, where we would\\nhave an insight on a group of six and the enhancements to their amnesia and how they develop from it. Even then, an apparent anime like this had its deficiency and I’m astonished to know it does.\\nNegatives\\nDespite the very slow adaptation, there was no exhilarating tension or motivation to the anime till the very few episodes. Grimgar was a story that was going nowhere till they picked up an objective that wasn’t even enthralled upon at the few last episodes. Very repetitive episodes as only a very few things would happen as it’s a part of the progression within the anime, which it would conventionally be the party just going out to kill some goblins then coming back.\\nAs the other reviewers stated, it’s very hard to not reference a spoiler so yeah, spoilers up ahead in the next paragraph.\\nThe characters felt very disengaging because of the lack of condolence felt for them. The fact that they killed off Manato in just four episodes immediately created a plot hole because of the lack of profundity put into Manato. I didn’t get to know him as a character; we didn’t get in depth of him at all hence why I couldn’t empathise for him. The fact that the characters would consistently drag Manato throughout the plot and weep for him made me feel excluded. It’s as if the plot was trying to renounce me to comprehend them or empathise for them in the slightest.  They were trying to make Manato as pertinent to the story as possible because it’s the only thing they were dependable towards. Also the foreshadowing of Manato’s death was too heavy; which made his death very obvious, and yes, in a bad sense.\\nEnd of spoilers\\nGrimgar fails to give any cognizance or impression of the world the group of six are living within by constantly focusing on them and nothing outside of their party. We are not given an perception of how other parties evaluate and evolve in the world they are living within a.k.a the world we are being shown. When the group of six are struggling to kill goblins, how are another party handling this? How did they handle this when they were or are in their position? Sure, this anime is not deliberately trying to focus on other people but just by describing how other parties are doing within the narrative occasionally would have been justifiable. Also there’s no clarification as to why Haruhiro and the rest were chosen to be summoned within the world we are shown. Why is it that they are chosen but no one else?\\nThere were a very few illogical clarifications for the people’s amnesia. How is it that they are well efficient of remembering their names but nothing else? There’s something about that that is very impactful on the characters. Does anything remind them of their name or something? And how is it that they remember the particular words they use but nothing else? Does anything remind them of the words they use? Grimgar fails to justify this. But even then, Grimgar badly brings the significance of that if we’re not going to know about the life the characters had before they came into this world. It’s pretty obvious that the characters came from Earth but Grimgar doesn’t really make that transparent.\\nThe fan service within this show is what I’m truly dissatisfied about. At first, this anime gives you the intuition that it’s one of those soothe animes that seems to have some kind of abhorrence towards ecchi and all that sort, till you watch it, only to find that it adds a lot of unnecessary fan service itself. Oh but the art style of this anime definitely gives you a sense of suspicion. When it comes to wanting to be goofy and thrilling, Grimgar is very dependent with its fan service and jokes about Yume’s flat- chest for that, which it’s very subjective whenever you like it or not (Which I didn’t really) It’s just the fact that Grimgar would execute these at the wrong time, which is where the issue lies.\\nThe pacing of this anime felt like complete torture. Grimgar didn’t manage the time of the twelve episodes properly and just tried to slowly progress the anime, most of the time being way too sluggish. Grimgar was way too enthralled on developing the characters that they completely overlooked everything else, which is giving the plot a resolution and getting into depths of the characters perhaps?\\nThe amnesia concept completely stripped the opportunity to get in depth of the characters to begin with. However, even though the anime had the chance to tell us about the back-story of each character before they came within the world of Grimgar, something is telling me that that will barely bring any significance to the tables. Their amnesia gets in the way of getting in depth of the characters because there’s nothing to say about the characters within the party of six except Mary. The amnesia concept brought a huge plot hole among the characters at the very start. The characters only came off very one dimensional expect Mary, who was the only three dimensional character.\\nNo character within the show was likable. This is more of a personal preference, keep that in mind. Every character was just pure mediocre. Even their character design was so generic. Each character just had that stereotypical role of their own. With Mary being that cold one but really when you get to know her, her attitude is very justifiable, Yume being the flat chest yet humble, Shihoru being the shy one who always cries, always has the oppais, Manato being the “Justin bieber” a.k.a the perfect, Moguzo being the quiet, peaceful, Ranta being the obnoxious and the Haruhiro being “the MC”. Heck, even the outside characters had their own stereotypical roles etc, Barbara = Fan service, Renji = the brave, admired.\\nPositives\\nDespite Mary, Haruhiro was a well executed character regardless of his lack of back-story (Something good about Grimgar?) Haru was nicely done depiction of the current reputation of the group. Haru alternatively came crucial; I’m quite astonished to see how the anime was capable of making Haru essential to the plot and the group. He is what created the perception put into the party. Haruhiro claimed his own hindrance and concerns as much as he represented that of the whole group’s, and he overcame his own as much as the group did as a whole. Some of you may be thinking “What about Ranta?” Sure, I will applause Ranta for his mentality and perspective on the group and how he’s just doing his part, however because of how unlikable he is and how this mindset completely changes within episode twelve, Ranta is just as mediocre as a character could get within his type.\\nGrimgar had rather good characterization (Yes, finally, something positive about Grimgar again) Why is it that they have good characterization? Well, because the plot was much focused on this that they received good results. However, don’t get the wrong idea, it’s not really anything bewildering, it’s just that Grimgar was capable of handling this without any issue.  Grimgar was very victorious with what it wanted to do here and it’s very comprehensible with what they were trying to depict, how the struggling, amateurish and primitive managed to develop into a tactful and rational. Very simple and nicely exposed.\\nThe water colouring a.k.a art of this anime was very heart-warming and made me feel comfortable and pleasant. I could go on describing it. As an artist, it was very admirable and motivates me into doing some water colouring with its warm colours. I adored how the background was done as well. Little to no effort put into doing it but in a respectful way.\\nEven though the opening and ending song has a very tedious tune to it, it’s very memorable. It’s something I hum from time to time and I think that’s a good thing. Something about the opening and ending was very clingy and addictive to listen to. It’s even more memorable than the Erased opening and I love that opening more than the Grimgar opening. The first half or the series and the ending song has very lazily done visuals and the second half of the series opening has some effort put into it but I still find something indolent about it. I’m not really concerned about the OSTs; it’s okay.\\nWhat to expect in Grimgar of fantasy and ash and Personal enjoyment -\\nBut the real question is, is this anime enjoyable? Honestly, this may come off as anticipating but it depends. Yes, this is one of those “It depends” types of animes. If you enjoy looking at very slow progressive anime, this is the anime for you. However if you want a nicely done anime but it gets to the point and it has an objective, stay away from this anime.  Be bound to expect a very slow anime with very torturing pacing, one dimensional characters expect one, unsympathetic death (not telling who), nicely done MC, nothing happening between the episodes and much more!\\nWhat makes this anime special is how it’s very considerate with its development so kudos to that! “But Pramma, did you enjoy this anime?” Honestly, no. It was so boring and it wasn’t really convincing or motivating to make me binge it till the very end.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"--The review contains spoilers--\\nThe show of it's season that everybody likes despite it's pretty bad. We have a group of teens who gets into a world based on RPG ruleset and shortly after this, they forget their previous life... and that's all. We won't get to know who they are, why did they get there, what is that place anyways, why does it operates like a video game, what should they do there. They just live their everyday life, learning some new skills, killing the low level creatures for the loot which they use to cover their living expenses and equipment.\\nThere are some conflict, they\\nlose a teammate, hire a new one who lost her team and slowly move on after their loss, but this doesn't start a real character improvement. It's trying, but doesn't goes anywhere. During their fights, because of this is a team, we might expect it'll be shown from a strategic point of view. They build up the tactics of their ambushes, comment how the teammates use their class' special skills to effectively operate as a team, but no. They just show their newly learnt skills without any deeper concept. We could think that after these they focus on giving the world some depth, who are these goblins and kobolds, are there any relation between them, what kind of society do they live in, why must they fight with them, why are they hostile by nature, by the way what kind of society do humanity live in this world. But no, we wont get to know anything about these either. The main issue with this show is NOT the slow pacing. The slow pacing can not be an excuse for the lack of world building and plot improvement. At the end there were some improvement in the representation of characters and the fight choreography, then, SLIGHT SPOILER, it ended with a terrible plot armor execution, END SPOILER.\\nThe art design is correct. The character design follows the typical A1 Pictures design. One of the main characters looks exactly like a brown haired Kirito. Not quite unique. The environment and backgrounds are a bit better. With this sketchy looking, hand drawn like appearance it's easily distinguishable from the other series of the studio. It's a matter of taste if you like it or not, I found it a bit self-serving, but a creative way to work with low budget, the main issue isn't this. The animation seems really cheap. The fight scenes are dull, there isn't any tension in them at all. It's nowhere near UBW or even SAO. Oh, and SAO, do you all remember the fight against the first boss with Asuna and Kirito? It was a good fight, they were working together, they looked like a team. I'm not an SAO fan, but that scene was alright in concept and visuality. Don't expect anything even remotely like that from Grimgar.\\nTo summarize, when I've seen the first promotional image, I knew I have to have low expectations. And thus fortunately or more like sadly I couldn't get disappointed. Not even pleasantly though. It sticks out downwards from average quality. Maybe the light novel was decent, I didn't read it, but there never were a moment when I felt the anime could be any better than a mediocre fantasy shounen.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, I had some pretty mixed reactions and feelings with this series. It had its\\' moments in various episodes where character growth, or the story & plot would standout.. then a few moments later an episode it would do a 360. I don\\'t want to call the show a roller-coaster though because I do not think that is the right term to describe.\\nMoving on from that though, considering where the Light novel left off and where the anime stopped, I think that A-1 Picture\\'s team did a pretty good job with pacing. They were successfully able to cover\\nmaybe 94-97% of the original story which is great. Now the story, It had it\\'s moments. Feels, excitement, comedy etc, all of it was in between \"Great\" and \"Meh\" I honestly felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall feeling that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar gave off to me, felt like it had everything together, however when things unfolded or events would take place it just seemed like things needed a little extra boost. I felt like most of the times the producers made things feel slower rather than fast paced because they were trying to add a little more emotional elements and moments especially when Minato died.\\nI was really glad that most the characters personalities, were drastically changed. Well, to be honest, I\\'m glad that they changed Yume\\'s personality because I wanted to strangle her character in the novel. Her speech was so damn annoying \"Yume thinks\" \"Yume likes\" UGGGHh!! I am just so happy that they changed the way she speaks. Now, Haruhiro, I\\'m glad his profile was changed too because I hated his whiny, lazy, useless ass. Now he\\'s still a bit useless at times in the anime, however to be fair, he is changing, he\\'s finally going through that phase most characters go through.... \"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\"... OR \"CHARACTER GROWTH\" :) Which ever you prefer to call it. Compared to their original designs, I have to give A-1 major kudo\\'s. I love it when I look at the original illustration designs for either Manga\\'s or Light Novels, then look at the anime adaptions because they change so much to (In most cases) Look a lot better. This is one of the many cases where the anime adaption of the characters look far more superior than the original designs and illustrations. Overall in the characters department I actually wasn\\'t that impressed. I felt like even though most of the characters have potential to be greater than what they are, most of Haruhiro\\'s team was \"Non-assertive\" or they just had a hard time serious taking action. Except Ranta.. however he was just a reckless S.O.B.\\nNow with Grimgar, I did think it was worth watching however, I also think it was a title that didn\\'t need to be over-hyped. I felt like I expected too much out of it. In fact, I would say that, that was my biggest issue with the series. I kind of felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall animation, soundtrack, story/plot and character was lacking in various ways.\\nAnimation felt very lackluster. Background settings and quality didn\\'t stand out at all or too much. I feel like if the animators made things pop out and look more visually appealing then I would not have had an issue. However, I personally think with shows like these, background settings add more of a \"realistic\" type feeling. The terrible painted, water-coloring-ish background settings -practically faded, just didn\\'t work out for me. The ending song, with the water-color-ish animation, that looked great. Very beautiful, plus the song sort of complement the art used.\\nOverall I believe that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was overrated , not over-hyped, I take that back. If you\\'re going to watch it, do not expect nothing but great things because the series, like many before and after it, is full of disappointments or faults... I have to give this title an 8/10 because I really liked the story and plot. I am a sucker for adventure and fantasy anime so I love seeing titles like these get noticed and put in the spotlight.. but with Grimgar.. maybe not so much. I hope to see a season 2 later in the future.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1b5cc420df8c3e9469597b3bb2585ba2'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Mature version of any \"rpg like shows\" the done right.\\nI\\'ll keep this short but informaive as I can.\\nMany misunderstand what the show is really about and what it\\'s trying to be. They complain \"just when will they get over with this and go start adventuring?!\" and claim \"nothing is happening bs!\" what they didn\\'t know is it\\'s not aimed to be that. Grimgar is all about the group of people who have been thrown in a world they don\\'t know, adapting their new environment bit by a bit. So as you can see, action is not the highlight of the show. It\\'s how they adapt\\nthe world and how they do it is what makes the conflict. And that\\'s where the interestingness comes from.\\nThe idea of \"adapting the world\" seems so Log Horizon yet it\\'s far from being exactly the same with Grimgar. the reason why is because Grimgar has a mature theme mixed with. it\\'s realistic, more of portraying the struggle of being in that situation. the struggle of having no money to buy what you need, adjusting to the people you have no relation with and so on.\\nThough I kind of Implying the series is somewhat of a \"survival of the fittest\", an opposite side existed. It has a slice of life vibe that gives you this country side feeling. The way it\\'s done is just amazing! it doesn\\'t feel like out of the place and I even find it pretty relaxing to watch and with the the calming music that plays along with the heartwarming backgrounds even make it more refreshing. How the characters respond to this SoL part is just amazing as well. You can totally see what they do when they are not in a hunt or that how they do their personal lives. through this, it helps them flesh out their character and make it complex the way that even if you try to remove the conflict of the story the existence of characters won\\'t feel empty they would still have something in them.\\nAbout the characters, many find them boring. I kind of agree that they don\\'t have any interesting side but what makes up for it is their interaction and development(the strongest points of the series actually) and if I have to defend it more, my reason would be because they are not supposed to have an odd or a special personality. They\\'re designed to be realistic. To make you relate to them. Which explains why their team spends so many time to get stronger. Because no normal teenagers would desparetly want to fight for death. which is what I realy like from the series. you can just clearly see their growth. Of how at first they can\\'t kill a single goblin and becomes just like a murderer, the first time they face the act of killing they get nervous and tremble but the afterwards they loses their sense of guilt.\\nSpeaking of the character development greatness, it\\'s just really top notch. It\\'s realistic, way more believable than any shows does. It doesn\\'t happen right away making a huge jump, it\\'s carefully taking its time progressing their development to make sure it will look real and it doesn\\'t completely change their character which some shows or books seems to always get wrong. Their development to their friend\\'s death, is just so good! each of them shows different signs of reaction and develops differently according to how close they were to their friend. Which proves the uniqness of their character. It flows perfectly not missing any phases. From denial to mourning to acceptance and to learning and you can really see the changes of their actions, reactions, and interactions little by little as they repeat the same thing over and over(killing goblins). They start adjusting-- trying to adjust themselves more to each other.(Especially after Mary, the best girl, was introduced) their teamwork becomes better, they get stronger and their relationships gets tougher. It would just really surprise you that the boring characters you thought were actually complex. Just try to compare the whole character development of most of the show they always works the opposite always getting things wrong lmao.\\nOverall, instead of cool fantasy action shit, what you\\'re going to get in Grimgar is what I wrote above. It\\'s aimed for those people who wants to see something different. Just a reminder though, the series is so slow which most has a problem with. But it\\'s because it\\'s inteded to be that. Slow pacing doesnt really mean bad it depends if the show needs it or not. Like here in Grimgar it\\'s slow paced because the anime focuses at depicting the growth of a character which have to have long exploration. So if you\\'re the guy who would choose to fall asleep when traveling by a plane instead of enjoying a beautiful view then this might not be for you but if you\\'re that guy who would like to window watch to see that beautiful view you should probably try this.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4ade4e12f7f65eab7a206c8e63f60d48'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '[Spoiler Free Review}\\nStory (8):\\nHai to Gensou no Grimar tells the story of a group of people who all of the sudden see themselves in a completely strange and fantastic world, with no memories of where they come from, or who they where. The only thing they can do is try to survive by forming parties and hunt down monsters to gain enough money to get through the day. The anime shows the struggles of the group in this world. There is nothing really new to this kind of story, but what stands out is the way the story is told. Compared to the light novel\\nor the manga the director chose to produce a more slow paced anime. This resulted in a lot of slice of life/drama aspects that got to be explored more deeply. And also helped to get to know the characters better, seeing some things that usually are not shown at all in this kind of anime.\\nArt (8):\\nThe production was rushed and some times it gets pretty obvious. But overall the art is beautiful, the landscape looks a lot like paintings making it different and really stunning. The animation at the beginning was great, but as the anime progressed it started to show some flaws, but again, overall it is decent, and hopefully getting fixed in the blue-ray.\\nSound (8):\\nIts enjoyable, I liked the soundtrack, it gets the job done. It is pretty good.\\nCharacter (10):\\nIf the slow paced storytelling the director chose to follow helped something it was the character development. It is really great. You get to know the characters really well for a 12 episode anime. Character development is probably one of the strongest in the genre.\\nEnjoyment (10):\\nI rushed through this anime in about 2 or 3 days. It does not have cliff hangers but for me it made me want to watch the next episode just because it is good. Really enjoyed it.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Here I am writing my first review. I am not an expert with writing a review but I will try my best to depict the selling points of this anime. I always give every element a 10 and then take a point off along with any setback I find in each of these aspects.\\nStory: 9. The story would have been a masterpiece if the first three episodes have been squeezed into one. Nothing much happened. It should have dedicated the second and third episodes to explaining a bit more about the characters' past. However, from episode 4 onward the plot keeps up with the audience's\\nexpectation - those who still choose to give a chance to this anime up to the 4th episode will definitely finish it to the end. Although one might argue that the plot is very much cliched, it does a great job in bringing all those fun I had in the earlier years when I used to play MMORPG Game, Ragnarok, with my friends. The thrill of the battle from episode 4 onward will keep audience wanting to watch more. However, the anime does so without focusing much on the technicalities of gaming, unlike SAO, which preserves the beauty of the fantasy world.\\nArt: 10. Beautiful drawings on the background. The strokes and colours really brought up the laid-back fantasy setting to life. Attacks, being physical or magical, were excellently depicted.\\nSound: 9. Nice soundtracks. Peaceful music fits right into the laid-back setting of the fantasy world.\\nCharacter: 9. I took one point off from one of the characters who has been unnecessarily annoying. I did appreciate his presence as it stirs the conflict in the story but I would have appreciated it more if this character is that smart annoying guy. Otherwise, you have the Miss. Shy, Miss. Happy-go-lucky, Miss. Tsundere, Mr. Considerate, Mr. Perfect, Mr. Clueless Protagonist, and Mr. Annoying all in one bowl - just the right mix to keep the interactions among them interesting.\\nEnjoyment: 10. Reminds me of the teamwork and fun playing MMORPG with my friends. which is great. Unlike SAO, the anime brings the memories back without spoiling the beauty of the fantasy world by bringing up all the technicalities of gaming. Excellent job.\\nOverall:10/10.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Getting transported to a game world with fantasy elements. You’ve heard of these type of stories before in recent years. From Log Horizon to the infamous No Game No Life, it’s a recycled idea that has becoming a growing trend. What’s different about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Nothing really at first until you look a bit into the show. Well it’s not vastly different anyways. In essence, this series crafts a refreshing fantasy show with some intruding ideas but also ones that are unbecoming.\\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name, the series takes place in fantasy world of Grimgar. We don’t get\\nmuch inside scope on how the characters exactly arrived there but just the fact that they are now stuck in this world. Survival is what should be on the first thing on their minds as the party of strangers have to adapt with their newfound life. Consisting of a group of six members (Manato, Haruhiro, Ranta, Yume, Mogzo, and Shihoru), they are also told to be part of the Reserve Army forces and defend the world from monsters. I guess in a simpler way to say this, it’s their way of making a living and try to make the best of it in this new world.\\nI have to confess a few things though. First of all, the series’ focus on its world fiction is fantastic. By all means, it is rich in resources from the dense forests to the lush landscapes with a decent amount of wildlife. Plus, civilization is exactly what people may picture from a fantasy game. There’s old fashioned towns, rural caves, mountainous regions, and starry skies crafted with high fantasy elements in this imaginary world. Whatever the author was thinking at the time definitely got the general ideas right for the show. Secondly, the story is what I’d describe more as fusion of fantasy, action, adventure, but also feeling that borderlines slice of life. To sum it up clearly, the slice of life part depicts the every day adventures of the party. Of course, this includes forging new weapons, fighting new enemies, and unlocking new skills to survive. It also adapts character interactions which seems to be a pivotal part of the show. It’s easy to see that the party members become close as time passes on.\\nIn the beginning, they’re complete strangers with little memory about themselves besides their first name. After living in the new world for a few days, we can see the chemistry building between certain characters. Haruhiro’s relationship with Yume and Manato is prominent as they treat each other like close friends. Manato, the leader of the party is also a role model with his charismatic personality and is able to see the positives in people. Even Ranta seems to follow his lead despite being the hotheaded guy of the group, often known for causing troubles especially with Haruhiro and Yume. Speaking of which, Yume is the brave girl. She has confidence and builds a close friendship with Shihoru, a shy mage who struggles to open to others. Then there’s Mogzo, the silent giant who often supports the party in whatever means he can. See the diverse range of character personas here? It’s hard to imagine how they can all get along at first but as time passes, the show is able to capitalize on these characters both individually and collectively as a group. Later on, they even gains new member whom they have a hard time to accept at first but still welcomes her as a valuable member of the team especially upon learning their background story.\\nNow, the show is pretty repetitive with a sluggish pacing. It shouldn’t take long for anyone to recognize this especially with the nature of the story. The formulaic structure is basically the group learning new skills, occasionally gaining new equipment, while trying to improve their inner relationships. Sadly, monsters are limited to goblins and kobalds in the show and doesn’t get far in that territory. If you realized this and it’s not the type of feeling up your alley, then turn back now because this show will feel like a snoozefest to you. Otherwise for sheer entertainment value, it’s actually an emotional drive after the first half of the show. The concept of death becomes reality for a certain member of the party while the show exploits interpersonal conflicts. While the series does this well, I feel like it’s spending far too much time investing on certain plot mechanics at the expense of other potentials. Given the way this series is adapted (1 cour) and limited volumes, it’s not really impressive. Furthermore, the show‘s relationship dynamics can quickly become a bore once you see how much the show pushes that every episode. Don’t expect any legitimate romance to develop either despite some obvious hints. The show seems to tease that almost every episode especially between Haruhiro and Yume but nothing really comes into fruition. And if you’re not a fan of melancholic songs, then this show could be a nightmare. As a fantasy adventure, Grimgar often feels like a mixed bag; sometimes quite impressive while other times makes you wonder if it’s worth watching.\\nIn the meantime, the show does a fair job at demonstrating how a fantasy series should be about with its mechanics. There’s other adventurer guilds that looks credible, weapons that actually looks like it’s from a fictional world, and also various classes. (thief, mage, priest, etc) While the series isn’t like Sword Art Online with heavy game mechanics, it still knows how to execute some of them. However, the key keyword here is ‘some’. The mage class is one of the more underwhelming roles in the show with its limited spell set from what’s shown. From an objective point, I think the priest also plays an underwhelming role despite being invaluable for any party. Luckily, the action aspects saves that as it delivers some classic entertainment. It’s pretty fluid once you get used to it with a surprising amount of violence. On the other hand, the comedy is woodenly made. I forget the amount of time when the show makes lewd jokes (mostly because of Ranta). From extended dialogues about boobs to awkward misunderstandings, the show still falls into the formulaic light novel adaptations we see so often.\\nOne of the main highlights of the series is the fantastic artwork. It’s not just elegant but feels excitingly mythical that’s painted by colorful water paint. From mountainous landscapes to old fashioned towns, the show capitalizes every detail to precision. Even character designs looks vividly convincing as the guys and girls wear gear appropriate for their class. If you’re also familiar with shows like Aiura, then it’s recognizable at who worked on these designs. The show’s action is coordinated well with a nice amount of focus on teamwork and body movements. But like almost every light novel adaptations, it’s still vulnerable to some subtle fan service like Shirou.\\nMusic is one of the stronger dynamics of the series as well. While some say that the show’s tendency to constantly use insert songs can be an annoyance, it’s actually quite important to highlight the emotional values of the story. Character expressions matches in unison with the insert songs to show what they feel. This can be a hit or miss to viewers depending on how you take it by storytelling standards. Furthermore, character voice mannerisms aren’t too impressive in general. The most recognizable would be Yume though with her kansai-like dialect.\\nRyosuke Nakamura’s return to direct the show brings us this fantasy adventure, one that I can say is a good example of portraying an imaginative world. However, the overall storytelling isn’t too impressive while characterization is lacking t times. Still, I think it’s important to address that Grimgar isn’t about conquering the world. It’s quite simple really – just a party of members trying to make the best of their newfound life while trying to survive. If that isn’t your cup of tea, then it’ll be hardly enjoyable. In introspect, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a well-made show at what it is but not great.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a6bc79c9cb220fccddacb76dfd677358'}>,\n",

Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash may as well be the antithesis of RPG anime, which often depict their main characters as incredibly overpowered badasses.\\n(There are also some other things you can point out, like the hinted personalities of each character and the overall decent animation and insert song, but I wanted to point out its drama most of all.)\\nThe episode continues decently with some quieter scenes that introduce the characters better, and the interesting thing they throw at you is that Grimgar isn’t actually a game to the players, it’s real life. Through the flashback that happens right after, we see how this started: the characters simply appeared here with no recollection of their previous lives, but it’s evident they came from the normal world. Not a bad premise overall, though there’s one weakness to this that I’ll get into later. Anyway, there’s a pretty lengthy scene where the characters and a bunch of other players talk to some flamboyant guy. It’s a decent scene since it provides some info, but I’d like it more if this guy was around for longer than that one scene and if that random player didn’t grab his knife when threatened. WHO THE FUCK GRABS A KNIFE BY THE BLADE WITH THEIR BARE HANDS WHEN THREATENED???? WHAT THE FUCK???? THAT’S LITERALLY THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IN THIS SITUATION???????????????\\n*ahem*\\nWhile that scene and the one after are just passable, the rest of the episode hilariously tumbles down its own mountain of potential after only taking a few steps. Haruhiro, the main character, joins a guild like his teammates, deciding to become a thief. He meets Barbara, whose character design is about as subtle as a bomb in a nursery. Holy shit. I mean, being fanservicey is one thing, but this chick looks like someone made a simple thief-looking character, and then a nine-year-old pasted a pair of huge anime tits onto her in Paint. It’s absolutely hilarious! But beyond dumb fanservice, the show practically smacks the viewer in the face by COMPLETELY SKIPPING THE TRAINING. WHAT THE FUCK? This scene builds up what could be a pretty intense training montage, and Haruhiro even laments a little bit, but we never fucking see it. That’s bullshit. Even worse is that no progress seems to have been made afterwards because all six people as a group struggle to kill a single goblin. Noobs.\\nAfterwards, we’re “treated” to an utterly horrible scene where a running competitor for Largest Shitlord of 2016 complains about one of the girls in the party for having small tits, and praises the other girl for having oppai. tHIS SCENE GOES ON FOR FIVE MINUTES WHY DOES IT EXIST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ANIME. WHOOPS MY BAD FOR THINKING A-1 PICTURES COULD HAVE TWO GOOD ANIME IN ONE SEASON.\\nIt’s really sad, because while watching that scene, I turned into Shia Labeouf screaming “DO IT!!!!!!” when that archer chick who kinda looks like Whitney from Pokemon SoulSilver takes aim at Ranta. DO IT. JUST DO IT. NO ONE WILL MISS HIM. That would’ve made for such an interesting scenario and add more tension. Like, everyone wants to get through this, right? But no one trusts each other because someone’s crazy enough to kill another just for saying some bad things. ...but instead she decides to just rub her entire body on the oppai character for no reasON IS ANYONE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AT ALL??? GOD I’M PISSED.\\nAnyway, I explained the entire episode because it highlights everything that Grimgar does well. The protagonists are extremely weak, making each battle a struggle. The setting and the overall premise has some flaws, but they’re pretty good overall. But then you’ll be treated (read: tortured) by some scenes that just last way too long, contribute way too little to justify their length, and can often be just plain stupid.\\nThere’s also something that really needs to be said about Grimgar and its pacing. There are many, many times throughout the series where it is not moving at a slow pace, it’s moving at NO pace. All of these slower scenes that, at best, give a few minor details about the characters, can be done in half the time at most. Honestly, they could be removed altogether to make room for more important scenes. I mean, do we really need to watch Ranta argue with the other guys for five minutes because he wanted to spy on the girls in the bath? Do we need Haruhiro to walk around town for five minutes just to have a conversation with Mary about where they’re living?\\nGrimgar will manifest its current mood into a physical form so you can be bashed over the head with repeatedly until you get the point. Honestly, it comes off as pretentious. No, there’s no deeper layer of symbolism that requires a brainstorm to figure out, it just holds on to its “deep” atmosphere and asks you several times, “Are you absolutely sure you understand what’s going on here? GUYS, LOOK HOW COOL WE ARE!! LOOK AT US, WE HAVE FEELINGS!!! FEEL SOMETHING!! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?!?!?!?!?!” Fuck off, Grimgar. I don’t need to watch characters cry for eternity to figure out that something’s wrong. There is slow, and then there’s wasting time.\\nOkay, so it messes around with the themes too much. What else does Grimgar do in terms of story? Well… nothing. Grimgar manages to slightly outpace a half-melted snail covered in glue, but at the end of twelve episodes there’s still bugger all that they’ve accomplished. They got less shit at killing goblins. Okay. Great. If anything, the party loses their progress somehow (shh, spoilers) and much of the remainder of the season is spent on making that up. They spent twelve episodes going from 0 to 0.5. “But I thought you liked the fact that everyone sucks!” --possible argument. Yeah, for like two episodes. After a while, it got old, nothing happened, and I’m just sitting here wondering what the point of these twelve episodes were.\\nSpoiler alert! This happens pretty early but it’s still major, so I recommend skipping this next paragraph if you don’t want any spoilers at all.\\n- So, what do you think “ash” in the title ‘Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash’ implies? My patience? Good guess. Either way, it’s Manato. Manato dies and they cremate him. Ha ha ha. It’s pretty interesting that such a thing would happen early on, but the death is incredibly obvious. They keep hinting it’ll happen as if to say “Hey! You know what would really suck?! If this guy died right now!” Plus if anyone’s gonna die, it’ll obviously be him because he’s the least replaceable, most responsible, and the overall leader. His death would be the only impactful outcome. But him dying so early means that the audience doesn’t get to know him much, so I don’t really feel anything from this. Everyone crying about it until the episode ends doesn’t make it more meaningful, it feels more like a girlfriend crying over the death of her dad she didn’t actually know. Then they keep bringing him up at every waking moment. Shut up! I hardly knew the guy! Leave it alone! -\\n-end of spoiler-\\nAnd just a quick word about the action itself before moving onto the characters: the action in this anime is okay. It’s a little more cooperative, with the entire party being involved in a fight and playing different roles, but as you can guess by them fighting goblins most of the time, the fights are very basic and not exactly interesting. I can optimistically believe that Grimgar will evolve with its action as the characters get stronger and learn more interesting abilities, but for this season it isn’t much to talk about.\\nThis probably isn’t a surprise at this point, but I didn’t really care for any of the characters in the show. Mary is the best, I guess, because she had an actual backstory that explained her personality and actions well. But, was she an interesting character? No. She was simply a bitch, and it was obvious that her reasons were gonna be that someone close to her died. Hooray, friends dying! After getting to know the party more, she becomes less of a bitch and just a level-headed character.\\nRanta is an interesting one. He actually provides some needed internal conflict in the party. He does whatever he wants and doesn’t really care about what the others think, and rejects the party leader’s desires for everyone to be close and more cooperative. Basically “I’m doing my part, fuck off.” Except Ranta’s also the most punchable, arrogant, annoying piece of shit in the world of Grimgar. I understand his character, but he’s annoying and I cannot get myself to like or even connect with him. And that leads me to the next part…\\nThe players in Grimgar have no recollection of their lives before the “game”. This means that we can’t understand the characters and why they act the way they do. Ranta is an annoying bastard, yes, but WHY? Logically, he has no reason to be at odds with the rest of the party, but I’m sure that his reasons are because of something that happened in his actual life that may or may not be explained eighty light novel volumes (roughly 67,130 anime episodes by the sound of it) from now. How wonderful. Notice how I’m not bringing up the other characters because they’re about as flat as a cat that’s been run over by an 18-wheeler a good ninety-something times. Haruhiro is decent, since he feels conflicted with his role in the party, but his lack of initiative and confidence make him an absolute bore to watch.\\nThings get real interesting when you look at the art. Without a doubt, Grimgar’s biggest assets beyond Shihoru’s ass-ets are definitely the watercolored backgrounds. They’re stellar. Truly. But, I wish they had more depth. What do I mean? Well, the backgrounds are nice, and it goes beyond environments--even buildings and shops are styled the same way, but what about the monsters? You’ll see more than goblins in the final few episodes, but all monsters just look like they came from any other RPG. I can understand humans looking like regular humans because they probably didn’t actually come from this world, but the monsters should’ve looked more natural to the world. It would’ve at least made up for their incredibly generic designs. At least the humans are a step above totally generic, but not much higher up.\\nThe rest of the animation can hold up decently… some of the time. The fights look okay, but the budget for the softer scenes must’ve been spent on donuts for A-1’s staff meetings. There’s an incredibly hilarious scene where three characters walk down an alley… scratch that, they don’t walk, they fucking bob around hilariously like someone stuck their cut-outs onto a popsicle stick and moved them around on some watercolored painting. Thank you, A-1. Just, thank you. Many other scenes simply use little-to-no animation, often resorting to still frames. But, hey, have some more watercolors because that’s all we’re good for! Case-in-point, the OP.\\nThe opening theme quite literally has no animation. There’s maybe five seconds of it, and the rest is just panning shots of the characters. Did they seriously think they were making an ED? ...Well, I guess not, because the ED does the same thing as well! Funny enough, the OP actually was decent for a few episodes--not really stunning, honestly, but at least it was fucking animated. The song stayed the same, but they changed the visuals and just didn’t care enough. Maybe they thought no one would actually watch the OP that long because the song isn’t that great.\\nAlso, the OP song isn’t that great. Just gonna throw that out there. Generic rock track meets sharp violin and a pretty weak vocalist to bring you a pretty forgettable song. But, interestingly enough, much of the soundtrack is actually very good, including the emotional ending theme. The real keepers are the many insert songs used. Seriously, there’s probably at least one insert song in each episode, and all of them, with the exception of one or two, are pretty great. I’ll totally be looking forward to purchasing it in a very legal manner.\\nI wanted to like Grimgar. I really did. But it misunderstood itself very hard. When I wanted it to be serious, it tried being goofy. When I wanted things to progress, it insisted on being deep and thoughtful. Should a second season appear someday, I may come back to see if it’s improved, but it will be through a much less patient mindset.\\nStory - 5/10\\nArt - 7/10\\nSound - 9/10\\nCharacters - 3/10\\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\nPlayability - Youlostthegame/10\\nOverall - 4/10\\nFavorite character - Mary or Merry idk this website and the subs don't agree\\nFavorite episode - 1 because i yelled at it so much\\nRecommendation level - Medium\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '30ce972502517bbedb81b0fa83e94485'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'If I am being honest right now, I loved Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. To me, it was a fresh look into the Fantasy RPG genre, one which is overcrowded with absolutely god awful shows. It is one of the special shows in this genre in part due to its realism in storytelling in its genre and actual well developed characters.\\nStory: 8/10\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar tells the story of 7 characters in a world they have magically transported to. Many other characters have also been transported there for no apparent reason. This large group of people forms smaller groups to go and hunt\\nmonsters in the surrounding area for loot and to survive. Now you may be wondering to yourself, man this sounds a lot like everything else in this genre, why should I watch it? Well, this is because unlike many of the other shows in this series, Grimgar gives us weak characters that actually develop and grow unlike those Over-powered MCs (I’m looking at you Kirito). The characters have to develop to survive in this world, hone their skills, work on learning new skills, coordinate as a team, and many things you would expect to see in the survival of a group of people. Although the pacing of the story is really slow, it benefits this show helping to develop the characters more thoroughly. The story itself is great but with a generic start, and A-1 pictures being A-1 pictures, the story just fell short in the end not living up to my expectation of how the ending would play out.\\nArt: 10/10\\nNow if there is one thing that A-1 pictures can actually do good, it’s the art work of a series. This is some of the best art I’ve seen in a while from an anime. The background is wonderful. The water colored background really stands out to make it different from many other anime out there. There is little to no drop in quality throughout the series. Animation is smooth, clean, it looks wonderful.\\nSound: 9/10\\nThe sound is great in this series. It really lends itself to certain scenes. The opening and ending songs are all very beautiful and I really enjoyed them. The insert song “seeds” is also one of the best insert songs I’ve heard in a while. It’s wonderful to hear absolutely great to hear such amazing songs from (K)NoW_NAME.\\nCharacters: 10/10\\nThe characters are absolutely one of the best parts of the series. Most of the characters get great development. Almost all the main characters get a good amount of development and the development is actually very interesting. From tragic backstories in some, dealing with loss in all of them, and how they interact with each other all give us a good look into these characters. These characters also aren’t strong, they are weak, and grow as the story progresses. How they look at life, and what they do in the aftermath of some events really helps to give these characters a realistic feeling. Their reactions to everything feel so authentic. It’s not like watching Sword Art Online where character development is absolutely trash; this anime takes time to develop all its characters. This makes the series slow overall but makes it so much more enjoyable when you actually feel attached to the characters from their backstories and what happens to them. It’s an absolute masterpiece in terms of developing its characters to the fullest and has some of the best characters I have seen in an anime.\\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\nI loved this anime, it was an absolute blast to watch in part to its difference to other anime in this genre. It didn’t go through with many of the clichés and did things you would normally not expect in this genre. I really enjoyed that originality aspect of this series. The slow pacing rather than killing the experience for me, heightened it. This was what I though Sword Art Online should have been.\\nOverall: 9/10\\nSo do I recommend watching Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Yes, an absolute yes. You must watch this series if you like the Fantasy/RPG genre. This anime shows how good a fantasy anime can be after years of horrible fantasy anime. It brings out all the good points of what a fantasy anime should be. With absolutely amazing characters, sound and world-class art, this is definitely one anime I will come back to watch again.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6ea6e5a2c8815e084b8be942e2b59f18'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I\\'m honestly not comfortable with reviewing something like Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash because it\\'s one of those shows where every single one of my complaints can be countered with \"well that\\'s what the fans like about the show\". Which is true for a lot of bad anime in general, but Grimgar is one of those shows that\\'s specifically made to draw \"feels\" from the viewer without the structured story that ERASED used aka the main the reason why I cared for ERASED\\'s cliched \"feels drama\" in the first place. So me saying it doesn\\'t have a story as the main reason for not liking\\nit is the equivalent of me going on a rant about how much Uchouten Kazoku sucks because...oh wait, I did do that.\\nNevertheless, mood pieces just seem to exist in the same dimension as \"walking simulators\" in that they follow their own set of unique rules that most people would consider good, but I consider to be the equivalent of injecting myself with morphine. Forgive me if I was raised to believe that all stories were supposed to have actual story to them. But whatever, we\\'ll play it your way for now, fans. Anyways, Grimgar is another \"light novel adaptation about a bunch of teenagers being trapped in a video game fantasy world\" and comes with the usual baggage that comes with being based on a light novel. The terrible sexist jokes that add nothing to the product and should have been cut out completely. The large amounts of talking that get in the way of actual plot progression. The fact that certain plot turns are telegraphed from miles away. The fact that this is \"light watching\" in general, and I don\\'t enjoy light watching.\\nSimilar to Phantom World, Grimgar stands out a bit from the usual by-the-numbers dross that gets tossed our way by having an actually talented director onboard and after a bit of a rough start, it takes itself a lot more seriously. However, unlike KyoAni\\'s thing, Grimgar is first and foremost a drama with some (bad) comedic moments, which is probably why it got a much better reception since A-1\\'s heartstring tugging is something that anime fans love to eat up. But more than that, it actually takes its \"trapped in a video game world\" premise as something with actual stakes and underdog charm, right down to the characters being so bad that they can\\'t defeat a simple orc and having people actually die, thus causing them grief for a large amount of time. They don\\'t even explicitly state they\\'re in a video game, although the fantasy world is so RPG-like it doesn\\'t matter either way, and the road to forming bonds is a long but well-deserved one indeed - although the fact that the team members getting killed off are guys and the recruits they replace \\'em with are girls didn\\'t exactly miss my eye.\\nThis is all solid stuff to build a compelling narrative around, but Grimgar has about as much drive to do something with its edge as the seventh Harry Potter film, and is just content to let the stuff be the substance. You guys remember the complaint regarding how Deathly Hallows Part I was just a lot of running around without any real destination? Well that\\'s exactly what Grimgar lacks in regards to all of its elements: a destination. Ignoring the large amounts of time spent on building up its world and characters at the expense of plot, which quite frankly bored me so hard that I went surfing on the net whilst playing the episode in the background, I don\\'t understand what the end goal of this show is aside from being a more-realistic take on this RPG-genre. Bokurano is a more realistic take on the mecha genre, but it also had a destination for said take to work towards: fifteen kids have to destroy fifteen robots that will invade their world and only by defeating them can they prevent said world from becoming erased.\\nI mean do these kids even want to go back to the real world, assuming they have a real world to go back to? What\\'s the specific requirement to do so? Okay, they get strong to survive, but to what end? I\\'m not watching a sitcom here. I\\'m not even watching something where romance is the main focus - and incidentally, the romantic chemistry between any of the characters in this show is about as stale as Jerry Seinfeld\\'s stand-up these days. None of the characterization is particularly strong to begin with as most of the characters\\' flaws don\\'t really factor into what actually happens in this show, aside from Mary, who is distant from people because her team was wiped out in a tragic incident that wasn\\'t even her fault. Grimgar isn\\'t a character study. It\\'s some sort of drama I can\\'t place, and if I can\\'t find a good way to describe it, it\\'s kind of hard for me to join in on the feels train unless you guys don\\'t mind \"confusion\" on board.\\nYou know that post I wrote a few days ago, questioning how much good execution is allowed to carry a product on its own? Well Grimgar embodies that question more than ERASED - and to a lesser extent, Gate - ever could. I mean aside from the bad jokes, it has a serviceable if not outstanding attitude towards its premise, but is that really enough to carry it for twelve episodes (and probably more when the sequels inevitably get announced)?. I mean I\\'m sure there\\'s going to be people who like that upcoming Hardcore Henry film solely for the first-person gimmick, but that\\'s a two-hour movie. Imagine an entire series based solely on that. And I\\'m more of an action guy than a feels guy to begin with, so me being worried about enjoying that says a lot.\\nI know a lot of people already made their position before they even read this review and thus have already dismissed my points out of hand, but...ah I dunno. Maybe I should just avoid mood pieces if what\\'s supposed to be good about them is completely opposed to my own ideals, but I really don\\'t think belonging to a certain genre means you shouldn\\'t at least try to have some sort of end goal in mind. I mean it\\'s not like this thing was advertised as an atmospheric piece of entertainment - no more so than ERASED at least - and I\\'m still going to be somewhat positive of ERASED when it did this shit because quite frankly, it did it much better. I would have preferred it to not have put itself in a Catch-22 position in regards to using its plot in order to give the emotional moments weight, but that\\'s all done with now. And quite frankly, I and everyone else are getting tired of bringing that show up.\\nSo to sum up this review in a nutshell...if you haven\\'t seen Rakugo, then give it a try right after you close this thing. I\\'m pretty sure people who like this show\\'s feels will like the ones in that anime several times better.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '696effa4fbc34cbd648e1f244bf14a42'}>,\n",

The events that occurs in the anime are incredibly well-placed, showing how it affects the cast and depicting the characters emotion and what they would be thinking without you even needing to read the dialogue to know.\\nAnd let me tell you, the way the writer portray the Human emotion was spot-on.\\n*Slight spoiler*\\nThere was a scene where they had to kill their first goblin, normally in another anime, they'll just kill the monster and not feel anything at all. But, in this anime when they killed their first goblin, they felt both guilty and helpless to what they should really be doing in this kill or to be killed world. However, as the series go on, they stopped feeling that guilt because they were used to it and more importantly, felt that if they kept feeling that sort of emotion, they would be the one to die instead.\\nMoreover, during their fights, if you watched the anime, the formation of the team and their strategies are completely wrong, further showing to us how these people are novices and not veterans.\\n*Slight spoiler end*\\nI would really love to mention another point in this anime where the emotion showed was exactly on point, but I'll avoid it to prevent spoiling.\\nThe Art in the anime is amazing, I've watched many anime where if the art was consistent I would be satisfied. But no, this anime brought it to another level, the art was drawn with water paint, and it blended in so well with the fantasy-like atmosphere. Honestly, I wouldn't mind printing out a portrait of it and hanging it on my wall. The second part of the opening was drawn amazingly (dem curves), but that's not the point of course... btw just have to point this in here but, Mary is fucking gorgeous.\\nSound - Nothing really sounds out of place for me. Personally, I absolutely loved the opening Knew Day, it is a great song and I really enjoyed it.\\nThe ending was pretty good too, but I preferred the Opening much more.\\nOST were pretty normal, but the songs played at certain points in the anime were much better than the OST. Some scenes had no OST but that was because these scenes simply does not need them, and if OST were forcefully placed in them, it would only ruin the atmosphere. However, I would've preferred if they had played more acoustic styled music to instigate the audience with a feeling of themselves being in the Grimgar environment, but everything is still good as it is.\\nUltimately, it comes down to whether you enjoy the anime or didn't enjoy it. I enjoyed it a lot, and I wouldn't complain about it even if I discover flaws, like come on, some little flaws isn't going to stop me from enjoying a show.\\nI base my rating off how much I enjoyed the anime, so please do not come to me to forcefully point out flaws on how my rating was too high or anything like that. I wouldn't mind a nice discussion on the anime but really, please enjoy it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '13bd0a37d20bd50059ee289fbe4c756b'}>,\n",

Without further ado, let my explain why I think what I think about Grimgar.\\nWhen I initially started Grimgar, I thought to myself, this can either be another Sword Art Online/DanMachi repeat with a fresh coat of paint orrr... an actually entertaining MMO/RPG genre show with likable/relatable characters in a unique setting, intriguing story and great pacing.\\nBoy, let me tell you I was caught by surprise when it was neither.\\nTo try to make this as short and to the point as possible:\\nThis show is boring. So. Very. Boring.\\nSo boring that I wholeheartedly struggled to move on to each episode and continue through the current episode that I was watching because of how bland the story and the characters were, despite the characters being put in a \\'survival of the fittest\\' setting with no memories and little money or experience as soldiers of the Reserve Army. You\\'d think some heavy character development is coming in and some crazy drama and dope, action-packed fighting scenes are coming in, when in reality my child, you are getting something that will potentially, bore the hell outta you, sedate you like Bill Cosby at the bar. You won\\'t enjoy it, for the most part atleast.\\nThe entire show makes you feel like it\\'s based off of Haruhiro\\'s inner monologues that give pointless insight on situations and conversations he\\'s having with another party member, as if to remind the viewer two or three times that the current situation or conversation took place. When a show reminds it\\'s viewers of something that took place prior or of something that made the character feel a certain way to make them have the inner monologue in the first place, it isn\\'t initially a bad thing, because it\\'s used to remind the viewer of why the character is currently feeling the way they are or why those feelings/thoughts may change. It keeps the story fresh so that the viewer may tread along with that in mind. But Grimgar over uses it. Too much. To the extent to where the show will have you thinking, \\'I know already, I saw it and heard you talk about it the first 20 times\\' or \\'Will he ever fucking get over it?\\'. It\\'s things like this people will use as a counter-argument when the topic of character development comes around to show \"character depth\" or \"character growth\" when it in cases, such as this one, the character did absolutely nothing but literally explain what just happened, through thought. Not that the viewer needed to be reminded initially at all.\\nThat being said, Grimgar overall is slow paced. Unforgivably slow paced, to the point to where the show feels more like a slice of life anime or as if you\\'re watching a filler episode where nothing relevant to the story happens regarding the plot. I think in story execution, where Grimgar did wrong was that it tried to portray each party member\\'s life outside of the battlefield/missions and when they aren\\'t together and it failed miserably. Almost nothing I can deem noteworthy can be taken from these scenes, as most of the time all they show are the characters shopping or taking in the view somewhere or pondering about something pointless or even worse, when the show decides to turn half of the episode into an AMV with music that doesn\\'t fit the current scene with watercolor still-frames depicting the same 3 or 4 images in different times of the day.\\nGrimgar in appearance is actually quite appealing. The water color sort of background and display, when used in the correct situation, gave it a nice warm and cozy sort of \\'at home\\' feeling, as if nothing life threatening or dangerous is bound to take place anytime soon and boy, does this give the show a sort of double edged sword effect.\\nWhile the water color works for scenes where the background is being shown off or the characters are having a conversation, it\\'s just plain awful when it gets to a fighting scene. Since this show uses more water color-looking and bright color overlay animation for most of it\\'s scenes, the hand-drawn animations when fighting are dull and not very appealing.\\nThis show is the epitome of dullness and boredom. Not even the drama or fighting scenes can save it from being overrated drivel adapted from a light novel no one can stop pissing themselves about. So overall:\\nStory: 3\\nNothing new. Overdone concept with a boring, lame execution and pretty colors.\\nArt: 5\\nLike I said, nice colors sometimes used in the worst of situations but when used correctly, total eye candy for sure.\\nSound: 4\\nMeh. Generic, unmemorable fantasy anime (or fantasy genre anything for that matter) music. It only got bad when the AMV moments came around and you can totally tell they just picked any j-pop ballad from the radio and stuck it in there with nicely drawn still frames as if anyone asked for them.\\nCharacters: 3\\nBland af. I\\'ve drank tap water with more taste. All generic and boring. The only character I remember is Shihoru and that\\'s only because she got those big anime tidd- I mean, she got that plot y\\'know? That goooood plot? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  y\\'know, the good plot the rest of the show seemed to be lacking in?\\nEnjoyment: 2\\nI didn\\'t have fun. I didn\\'t enjoy it. I don\\'t absolutely hate this show, but god was I bored the whole time. I tend to give shows an \\'A\\' for effort if they make me laugh, looked nice, had a good soundtrack or had a good enough concept or characters to carry it, but this show literally had nothing, literally nothing worth mentioning. At all. I felt like the only thing keeping me interested was Shihoru\\'s...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) fuck it, not even that was enough fam. Seriously. Maybe. Idk.\\nOverall: 3\\nI know there are people that are into this whole \\'fantasy/mmorpg\\' type of thing and that are lenient with super slow snail pacing but I honestly wouldn\\'t even use this show as a weapon to torture my worst enemy with, it\\'d probably put his ass to sleep or something. Poorly thought up jokes aside, this show is pretty bad and I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. Though if you would like to give it a try, who am I to go against your wishes? Go for it fam.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'To summarise it simply, Hai to Gensou is basically a story that doesn\\'t know what audience it\\'s trying to target and what genre it\\'s trying to be in.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n*Spoilers henceforth*\\nStory: 2\\nFirst of all, if it wasn\\'t for all the combat and amount of fanservice I would have thought the story was targetted towards women, given the amount of emotional drama that keeps going on. People keep crying about the guy that died earlier throughout the series, along with all the whining about how incompetent they are, as well as some blame games going on. They don\\'t seem to properly resolve their emotional issues as they just\\nflip in and out of their emotional states like a switch, with us only knowing that they probably overcame their sadness because the guy is eventually mentioned very little.\\nNext. It\\'s yet again, an RPG theme, not that I particularly mind. However, it doesn\\'t seem to know whether it wants to be a fantasy RPG (like Log Horizon) or a real life RPG (like Danmachi). It seems to want to be a fantasy RPG because of stuff like classes and the characters waking up with amnesia. Yet it wants to be a real life RPG as well because of hunger, money management and actually dying.\\nBut the most striking thing is the lack of exploring the mechanics of the world. Why are there classes? There is a magic system in this world and it comes in the form of chanting, but we\\'re not explained how it works. Can only special people use it? And what does it run on? We don\\'t know, other than \"I can\\'t cast anymore\". If everyone has magic, then why can\\'t you just cross classes and have everyone learn a healing spell? Also, there\\'s nothing really stopping our protagonist, Haruhiro, from learning to use the bow as well to provide support from behind. Another thing is that goblins and kobolds (our introduced creatures) are treated like some sort of thoughtless grind mobs, even though we see a lot of what looks like human qualities.\\nThe third thing that irks me is the atrocious communication as a team. No one seems to know what their other party members are capable of doing or what their strengths and weaknesses are. They only have a vague idea and pretty much always just rush in and ad hoc it, yet they somehow manage to pull it off. But it\\'s not only just their dialogues which are horrible, it\\'s also their actions. So much of the time it\\'s as though they\\'re waiting for prompts from someone else before doing anything. An example is in Ep11 where Haruhiro just fell off a tower and gets grabbed by Ranta. Then silence... After which Ranta then immediately yells at Haruhiro to start climbing. Yep, you got that right, Haruhiro just starts AFKing or something after he gets caught and needed Ranta to wake him up.\\nAnother problem is their illogical decision making. They literally spent the first few eps trying to kill a goblin because everyone has to go in one at a time. The other plot device was basically going to the kobold mines. Now there\\'s a good reason why they shouldn\\'t go to the mines, which everyone already knows why, and what prompted them to need to change hunting grounds was because the original spot became too dangerous. Now, the reasoning for going to the kobold mines was literally \"I don\\'t know where else to go\".\\nThis had potential to be a decent slice-of-life or maybe even romance story given that those moments weren\\'t actually too bad. What ruined that potential was that the author wanted to write an RPG story but seems to have no basic concepts on how fantasies, let alone, RPGs work, while also wanting to include fanservice.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nArt: 8\\nI\\'m actually not too fond of the background art, yet it was pulled off quite nicely. The background art is some sort of watercolour, yet the typically drawn characters don\\'t actually stand out from the background, rather they actually blend in pretty well.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSound: 8\\nI actually like the OP and ED songs and the voice actors did a pretty good job distinguishing themselves as unique characters. Haruhiro has a pretty nice monologue voice and I liked Mary\\'s somewhat mature voice.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCharacter: 2\\nBasically, apart from Mary, everyone is just whiny. Everyone is always either complaining or moaning about something. There\\'s never actually any thought put into their occupation.\\nI feel that Manato was killed off because the author realised the imbalance of genders as he already wrote it, and needed to kill someone off so Mary would join, thus making it 3 girls 3 guys.\\nMary and Haruhiro seem to be getting pretty close, while Ranta and Yume might eventually, which leaves Moguzo and Shihoru.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEnjoyment: 2\\nEvery episode was basically me thinking: \"So... are they going to grow a brain now or is the plot armour going to wear off\".\\nBut then I was surprised and disappointed by the deus ex machina at the very last episode.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOverall: 2\\nEverything about this title feels half assed. It\\'s like the author only had nominal ideas in his mind then just wrote down what he learnt in drama school. Teamwork is non-existent, decision making skills are that of a toddler, and worst of all, the ending is deus ex machina.\\nAnd if I had to make a comparison. This story feels like it wants to be something like AnoHana, but the emotional side gets smudged out by people\\'s consistent whining of the same thing and stagnant fights.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4b9d52168610e169ac814b1b7a3ba3c9'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Oh, it\\'ll be a hell of a ride. So fasten your seatbelts and enjoy my review. This review may include some mild spoilers; be warned.\\n1. Concept\\nThe first thing must be said for Grimgar is it may be the best \"being thrown into a game\" story after good old Jumanji.  Grimgar nails on details no other anime series of the same concept didn\\'t even bother to mention. The best (in my opinion) detail Grimgar is the feel of being in an alien land. Our heroes and heroines have no idea about where they are and what they are supposed to do. They have no clue\\nabout their pasts except some bleak words whom they can\\'t remember their meanings. And after being guided to the start of their adventuring career this feeling of being in an alien land reflects itself as inexperience; they make fails, they have coordination problems when fighting as a party, they struggle to survive, they seriously live the stress of earning enough money to buy food (they even can\\'t buy new pairs of underwear for quite some time and had to wash their underwear every day), and hell; they even hesitate to kill a living being since THEY ARE TEENAGERS WHO HAVE NEVER SWUNG A SWORD, SHOT WITH A BOW AND ABSOLUTELY HAVE NEVER, EVER LIVED IN A HIGH FANTASY MEDIEVAL-ESQUE WORLD!  This amount of detail is so astonishing that with every passing second, you love this series more and more and more.\\n2. Story\\nAs I mentioned before, the story is about a group of teenagers struggling to survive in a \"land of ash and fantasy\".  They know nothing about their past lives except some bleak, distant words they use subconsciously (like \"phone\"), whom they can\\'t comprehend their meaning. So, we know that they are hailing from our world and from our time but their reason to be trapped in Grimgar remains a mystery to be revealed. In the first season, we won\\'t have much clue about it, though. The first season is about their struggle to survive in this world and being adapted to it. And this aspect of the story is handled amazingly well. We see some real struggle while they are trying to be the characters they\\'ve intended to be and failing at it, since it\\'s actually really difficult to survive in a world full of monsters and magical things (Tabletop RPG players will understand me and speaking of which, I salute all of you fellow Pen & Paper players!), especially if you are some teenagers from a high-tech world; ours, in particular. This level of authenticity is amazing. On the other hand, I don\\'t know how they will handle about the mystery part of the story but I\\'m sure that in next seasons (if there will be next seasons, of course) they\\'ll handle it as well as they did in the first season\\'s story.\\n3. Characters\\nThe number 1 reason I really like Log Horizon, another \"being trapped in an MMORPG\" anime, is the authenticity of its characters; we have some kids who have hard time to adapt, some adults who lost their sense of sanity because of the event and some other adults who try to stay calm and do something to prevent people from going mad. Grimgar\\'s characters side is also strong at the aspect of authenticity; we have a group of teenagers who have a hard time while trying to adapt to an alien world. The series lets us see clearly what characters think about the situation via dialogues and monologs. We see their doubts, fears, sorrow, sense of being lost and amnesiac. But on the other hand, they are still teenagers; they are exploring themselves like any teenager who hit the puberty. Boys, for example, make dirty jokes, make comments about the hotness of the girls in the party, they even subconsciously take a peek to their breasts.  The only one out of this puberty drama is Moguzō; the oldest guy of the party and he shines like a lighthouse of sense in a band of puberty hit teenagers, just as how it should be!\\n4. Gameplay Mechanics & Fights\\nAs I understood; Grimgar is a game closer to tabletop RPGs\\' style rather than MMOs\\'. In my opinion, it\\'s a huge upside. I like Tabletop RPGs\\' handling gameplay elements like spellcasting, fighting, adventuring,  leveling up etc.  I\\'ll mention some things about these. For example; in Grimgar, you need to pray for a spell if you are a priest or read invocations and make ritualistic movements if you are a sorcerer. If you want to make your characters stronger you need to find a trainer and spend some time with training.  You should allocate money to food, survival gear etc. (Also; you should wear your helmet if you have one since arrow shots to the head or head traumas are fatal things. :D ). \"Skills\" used in combat are not some flashy and non-practical moves but tricks and techniques derived from real medieval warfare (mostly, even though not completely).\\nAnd the last thing I\\'ve mentioned makes Grimgar\\'s fight scenes awesome. There are no flashy movements, melee fighters are careful about their footing (which is an important element of real life melee sword fighting), they  try to parry or dodge the attacks (since being hurt and in pain are huge disadvantages), ranged fighters and offensive casters tries to make their shots count via having the high ground and reading the battle carefully. And Haruhiro; the ace and the rogue of the party is always moving, seeking the weak points while staying in the shadows and protecting his friends\\' backs since they are busy with fighting the enemy. Now this is how fighting should be!\\n4. Art\\nArt is awesome. There\\'s not much to say; hand-painted backgrounds are awesome, character designs are awesome, almost completely authentic design of weapons and armours are awesome.\\n5. Final Words\\nGrimgar is not perfect, I know it but it still has the potential of being the best \"being trapped into an MMORPG\" anime ever. The story is not complete,  there\\'s only one season but I hope the sequels is going to be made. I trust this series\\' potential with my whole heart.

I simply say they\\'re morons who didn\\'t understand what they are watching.\\nNow with Hai to Gensou no Ketsu (no Yume) people immediately think action adventure and when they do they think the pacing is horridly slow.\\nHowever, too those who actually understood what Hai to Gensou no Ketsu is - which is a slice of life in a adventure fantasy setting btw - then this glaring problem is gone. Well in fact it didn\\'t exist in the first place, because again, if you think this is an\\naction anime you\\'re a moron. Again repeat after me. SLICE. OF.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash) is significantly different in comparison to other fantasy/action RPG-esque anime. Although at first glance it appears to be your generic \"trapped in a video game\" type premise with an either fresh out of the boat overpowered or limitless potential main character, the show strays away from the archetype and tells a different story based more upon it\\'s characters and how they react and change to certain situations, rather than using the \"action\" aspect as it\\'s focal point. It also has a genuine focus on telling a more \"realistic\" fantasy story by having our main characters\\nbattle the weakest monsters and still failing as the very first step, which is definitely scarce in the medium and is a welcome change of pace.\\n(8/10) The plot, while weak in general direction and lack of urgency at the start, is compelling when you grow attached to the characters, and begin to follow their motivations and goals. However, as I say this, it must be noted that this kind of story may not be for everyone. It\\'s rather slow at the beginning and may deter viewers from continuing due to the previously mentioned \"lack of urgency and no clear storyline\". However, the show certainly does pick up later on as the plot attains that \"urgency\" and action it had been previously missing. The pacing of the show is done well and there are no immediate time jumps or episode rushing.\\nFor those who find shows with rather slow moving episodes unbearable, I\\'d still give this a shot considering things start to get moving quite quickly. Also, if you absolutely hate the characters and don\\'t give a flying turd about their goals, I\\'d say avoid this one.\\n(7/10) Although the anime ventured into relatively creative territory with the fully watercolored backgrounds, the same couldn\\'t be said for the characters themselves. There are animation errors on multiple occasions, the animation itself was jerky and jittery at some points (notably the short action sequences), and it just felt drab and just plain average in general. Although this is an easy oversight, I kept finding myself noticing mistakes and frequent lacks of detail all throughout. The fact that this aspect of the show is lacking in comparison to the rest is certainly not a reason to not still watch and enjoy it though, as many could watch it and not even have noticed that the art was subpar.\\n(8/10) The sound and music throughout was done very well in my opinion, although there were a few very strange and hilariously out of place music choices later on. However, these choices didn\\'t take away from my enjoyment of the story at all. Sound design was done well and there were no immediate discrepancies to the casual viewer.\\n(9/10) The characters are where in my opinion the show really shines. There are a total of seven main characters, all refreshingly varied and didn\\'t seem to follow a particular immediately recognizable archetype.\\n- First, we have our super perfect gary-stu kind of leader character Manato, who, granted, isn\\'t our protagonist. While this might look like a huge red flag, this character isn\\'t just perfect for no reason. His involvement and impact on the story helps develop other characters to a great extent, and becomes an important symbol and inspiration towards the end. He displays constant heroism and bravery as a priest, being selfless and kind to his group members.\\n- Then we have our actual protagonist, Haruhiro, who at first appears to be the most average of the bunch and has no immediate quirk or interesting personality. However, as the show continues, Haruhiro himself develops largely as a character and soon learns that he has to change in order for himself and the rest of the group to stay together and survive. Although I want to say that I actually liked his character a lot at the beginning even though he was devoid of interesting qualities because of how laid back and cool he seemed. It was and continued to be a very human quality which I found captivating.\\n- Moguzo seems to follow a general \"gentle giant\" kind of stereotype, which is a reoccurring connection that can be made when looking at his personality as a whole. He\\'s caring, soft spoken or just quiet, good at cooking and wood carving, etc. Just by looking at these few points, it could be said that his character ain\\'t very interesting or have any real contribution to the plot. And I could agree with you, but I find that his character on multiple occasions redeems himself and really starts to improve in the latter half.\\n- Many could agree that Ranta is the worst character in the show by a landslide. I would beg to differ, simply because the character has a lot more depth than what is shown on the surface. He\\'s essentially a male tsundere, a very persistent one at that. Although he constantly makes fun of his group members, has a massive ego, and is generally a dick to everyone, it becomes increasingly evident that he genuinely cares about his friends but is simply too embarrassed to show it.\\n- Shihoru is a short, well endowed mage girl that is very shy and even more quiet and soft spoken than Moguzo. She seemed to be a somewhat hopeless and unorganized character at first, which was particularly evident in battle. Like all the other characters, she improves and opens up little by little to the group as the plot continued, which was rewarding to see through. I found her to be uninteresting as a whole but grew to like her much like I did with Moguzo.\\n- Yume is a great character that\\'s aloof and lovable. She brings a sense of peace and relaxed attitude to the group when they\\'re not in battle, and proves to be a valuable teammate when focused. She cares about her group members, which she makes evident quickly, and bonds with Shihoru as they are the only two female party members at the beginning of the show.\\n- Mary is a character that\\'s not introduced before later on but quickly joins the main cast as she becomes a necessity. She\\'s cold, distant, and just flat out mean when she joins the party at the start, but inevitably warms up as the plot reaches it\\'s conclusion. I think she\\'s a great character and develops at a realistic pace, which is evident by the lack of clear \"bonding\" situations that other anime use.\\nWithout having seen the show, it\\'s difficult to imagine the kind of relationship these characters would have, which is why you\\'d need to watch it in order to understand that there\\'s a real layer of realism and just general human quality that can be appreciated here.\\n(9/10) The conclusion was done well. It left with a satisfying and relatively conclusive note, while leaving the show very open for a second season. Considering there is a large amount of source material to go through, I\\'d say that a second season is very much welcomed and wouldn\\'t harm the show at any stretch. As for my overall enjoyment of the anime, I finished it having been thoroughly entertained by each episode, even the slow moving ones because I really loved the characters and their growing bonds and relationships, how they dealt with tragedy and desperation, and eventually how they learned to accept hardships and found ways to overcome them.\\nOverall, I\\'d say that you definitely need to check this one out if you\\'re a fantasy/action fan that enjoys a large amount of character building and deviation from the mainstream fantasy RPG style shows. In contrast with other popular fantasy anime, namely KonoSuba which was currently airing at the same time that Grimgar was, it has a much more serious tone that is easily appreciated when you need your fix.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '98fb6b10e81c399a3f373e9bdecb15c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I just finished this show and was immediately blown away by the amount of hatred and dismissals of mediocrity I saw online afterwards, so I felt compelled to write my first review. The general consensus here truly shines a spotlight on why isekai, and really any overly-saturated genre, tends to follow the same paths and eye-rolling tropes.\\nThis isn't your typical flashy fantasy show, it's more of a slice of life drama slapped with an isekai perspective – it's about groups of seemingly random people that are summoned for the purpose of becoming low-ranking, unskilled conscripts where many end up as little more than cannon\\nfodder. Their purpose is to take care of all the jobs that proper guild members are too busy to bother with. This show follows one such group, comprised of people that were too weak to be chosen by any respective guild; hopes and goals start off simply trying to maintain some sort of livelihood in a world they know absolutely nothing about.\\nMany seem to have issues with the pacing and I can respect that, as it really just comes down to personal taste in that regard. If you're the type that doesn't tend to enjoy more character study-based plots or find things slow when there aren't big fights and world-changing events being met then chances are you won't think much differently here. While there is progress throughout, there's not going to be an overpowered hero that looks as if they can sweep the evil out of this world with towns of people kissing the blood-soaked dirt they stand on. Progress also doesn't happen due to some forgotten secret or dormant god-tier ability within the characters, jettisoning them to the levels of the guild members within the first few episodes. It's slow-going, it's hard, requires forethought and planning, but most of all, it's actually dangerous and consequential – they need to be able to rely on one another.\\nThis show is a strangely grounded take on a high fantasy tale. One of the first things that stood out to me were the interactions with the goblins. The group decided early on that goblin hunting was their best, safest bet towards avoiding homelessness and starvation, but it wasn't only difficult for them due to their lack of training and skills. The goblins were portrayed as living creatures with some level of intellect, capable of feeling pain and having a sense of self-preservation. The group had to struggle with the idea of ending an intelligent lifeform that was screaming in agony and desperation, one that didn't want to be ended nor was there for simple sweeping plot points. This idea was carried throughout the show, and at times even made me question the perspectives of the creatures they attacked.\\nLater on, I noticed virtually none of the guild members or leaders in town were irrationally hostile towards the group. Nobody was attempting to plot and backstab them, none of the leaders refused to help, nobody was trying to rob them or get in the way of progress as everyone is essentially in this together – they're all dealing with the same old nonsense that comes with the lifestyle of hunting these creatures. This is especially highlighted in the pub that the group was fond of visiting, as there were multiple times I expected some arch-enemy to appear with nothing better to do or someone to challenge them for the sake of plot. In fact, it was the other way around, as the struggles of the group came from within rather than from any particular outside source. These little unexpected twists on such a cookie-cutter genre really made the show.\\nNow here I will say there is a lack of world-building and lore that may turn some off. As the viewer you basically only know what the group knows, and their first priority is learning how to survive not figure out the history of the town and befriend everyone in sight. That said, there were times where they could have easily avoided a situation or learned more about an enemy by asking around first, possibly utilized a wider net of contacts to rely on in general. This issue actually was addressed early on with one tragic, hard lesson; however towards the second half of the show it was if they put the blinders on again.\\nSomething else that bothered me was one particular trope that the show did fall into, the ecchi undertones. Too many times did a shot consist of some random tits 'n ass with maybe a sexual reference or two thrown in, really wasn't needed outside one episode if at all. Though to be fair most of it did stem from one character that had his own issues to deal with and the others in the group didn't appreciate it.\\nAnyway, overall what makes the show is the group cohesion within an unknown, unfamiliar, yet bizarrely grounded fantasy setting. Their survival isn't easy and it's not meant to be, as at the end of the day they're composed of multiple insignificant people only dragged to this world in order to take care of the small stuff.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b0422091e83a0c3ab15c68c2c782c8b2'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I really like this anime and while I agree that it has a couple flaws and is for certain people not everyone. It starts slow and keeps a mediocre pace so if you only watch the first few episodes you don\\'t get as much pay off. For example the first fight the characters have is against a goblin but they can\\'t kill it right away, which makes sense as the only had basic training and are teenagers that we just thrown into battle.The story itself takes a more serious turn on the RPG genre, a bit like Goblin Slayer but a lot less edge. It\\ntakes small insignificant fights that are usually brushed over in other stories of the same genre and shows the realism as the characters fight for survival just trying to meet ends meet to survive another day. The story focuses on 6 main characters each with different classes:The levelheaded priest (Manato), the hotheaded DreadKnight (Ranta), the cheerful Hunter (Yume), the gentle giant Warrior (Moguzo), the shy Mage (Shihiru), and the apathetic Main character/theif (Haruhiro)   The characters themselves while albeit generic at the start, you can sense true relationships form as they try to understand each others standing in the party inside and outside of fighting. Haruhiro is used as a narrator through the story tracking the teams progress and often times acting as the strightman of the group Ranta acting as the ladder.\\nSPOILER (Skip ahead or read I\\'m not your boss):\\nWhen Manato the leader of the party dies, the story has a big shift as the character have to find a new member to fill that Manatos place. This death in the family effects the characters through the rest of the anime especially Haruhiro as he takes the acting role of leadership and often times questioning himself in his role leaving him wondering \"what would Manato do?\". This topic is never taken lightly and is brought back many times thought the story, like when the kill their first goblin the death is not clean like in most RPGs it\\'s gritty you see the goblin struggle and try to run away before it is taken down by Ranta who deals the final blow taken aback at what he had just done in taking a life, and the rest of the party horrified of how brutal and senseless the death is. The death of Manto is taken in a similar manner the death is a symbol of how gritty the world truly is. Manto\\'s death makes Haruhiro more of a interesting character in the end as we see how he deals with leadership and the internal struggles he constantly has.\\nSPOILER END(You can read from here spoiler free):\\nThe art for this anime is truly one of its best features, it uses a more watercolor like style making it look like it come right out of a picture book. The settings of each part of the land our heros explore are realistic and breathtaking. The action sequences are very well choreographed as the take weight of weapons and class into consideration, for example the lightly gear Haruhiro being a Theif class can move fast and swing quickly weaving in and out of enemy attacks with light swipes while the heavily clad Warrior Moguzo has a more slow approach in battle however his attacks are very heavy and carry power behind them. This consideration of weight and other aspect in the fight make each battle interesting and fun to watch. Beyond the art the music is quite good the opening song is a 10/10 in my opinion as it has a kickass fiddle solo true to the whole medieval RPG setting. and the battle music takes many shapes, a more punk hard metal for serious intense moments in fights and a more light jazz tune for less high stakes battles, the contrast helps to understand the mood of the characters during each fight. The ending song felt a bit generic but it is all right in its own right 7/10.\\nOverall this anime was a solid 9 in my eyes, if you watch the anime and are thirsty for more the lightnovel is a great read as it goes into more detail and delves more into the mindset of Haruhiro making him a more interesting character as he deals with his internal struggles of being a leader. The manga was unfortunately discontinued, I myself am not much of a lightnovel reader but this story is super interesting to read and I highly encourage anyone who is interested in starting to read lightnovels start with this one.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bac19beb4b3e1325159fb01d1e5823ce'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Boring. No other word encompasses the entirety of Grimgar than this word, a show that is incredibly slow, full of dull characters, lacks any interesting world or mechanical exploration, and brings up nothing new in the MMORPG anime genre. It's quite unfortunate as the trailers and first impressions of the anime advertised the opposite.\\nGrimgar's story is the same as the other “trapped in an MMO” plotline that follows. A number of people are brought to the world of Grimgar with no memories of their previous lives and they are brought forward to become adventures to survive. The story promptly ends there as Grimgar then focuses\\non a party of characters, how they interact with one another, and how they cope with their sudden thrust in to hunting monsters to make a living. Unlike other shows that try to focus on a plot, game mechanics, and the world, Grimgar instead chooses to focus on the main characters and how the harshness of being thrown in to something you have no knowledge about.\\nThe idea is fine. There is no problem with the direction that Grimgar attempts to go. The reason why the focus falls apart is because the characters are excruciatingly plain and boring. The main characters have no defining personalities. They lack any depth to their characters. Even halfway in to the show I can barely explain a character to someone who asks me about main cast.\\n“Hey, can you tell me about that mage girl?”\\n“Err... Well, she's kind of shy. And uhh... Umm... Her name is Shihoru.”\\n“Okay, what about the the large guy with the big sword?”\\n“He's a warrior. He uhh... doesn't talk much. And I guess he likes to carve wood.”\\n“Well this is lousy. What about the MC? You should be able to tell me something about him right?”\\n“Err... He... Uhhh... is the MC. Yeah.”\\nThe characters of this show are like white paint drying on a wall. Even as tragedies befall them and they cry to show some semblance of emotion, you end up not caring for them nor do you really empathize. When they speak the dialogue that follows is a jumble of generic interactions. Even Ranta, the character that is suppose to be the loud high-energy guy with his perverted jokes and shouts ends up just being another obnoxious character you can't care for. The few words or tropes you can ascribe to them, and the few character development they go through are marked by cliches. I could go to a local coffee shop and listen in on to two people and their conversation would be more interesting than this show.\\nThe core problem of Grimgar is that it fails in what it tries and forgets about everything else. The story abruptly ends in the first episode, the skill system and game mechanics are only ever briefly mentioned, the characters never go out of the town they reside in and fight goblins for half of the show. The only praise that I can give Grimgar is the first party encounter against a goblin where the fight is executed well and manages to convey the difficulty of trying to kill a living being just to steal its loot.

Then slows down again and picks back up. This process repeats itself multiple times. If you can\\'t stand that, don\\'t bother with this anime. There\\'s no real end-goal or quest, and kind of wants you to take it as it is. But due to the ending, there\\'s a lot of open\\nquestions and some things aren\\'t wrapped up. Namely the entire beginning premise of the show hasn\\'t been addressed.\\nThe animation itself is kind of inconsistent. It tries to go with an untraditional art style for the background only to sometimes forget itself. It doesn\\'t come off as overwhelming or nice to look at at times, despite what the producers probably thought when making it. It just leaves an \"Eh,\" impression. Nothing special apart from looking slightly different background wise. And even then, the high-motion scenes are certainly interesting, but don\\'t come off as amazing when compared to even some other shows.\\nThe sound is debatable, for a couple of reasons. And this ties into story a bit. This show LOVES, montages, and I don\\'t mean just \"love\", I mean it will lick the sound bytes off the floor just to put one together and get its fix. While the songs were pretty nice to listen to, when there\\'s a montage or two EVERY EPISODE when someone or something dies or they have an emotional moment, it gets insanely repetitive and kind of forced. Hell, they even sometimes play for 3-4 minutes of straight montages, that\\'s forever in anime time considering they could be progressing in the story through dialogue.\\nCharacters are kind of cut and paste. None of them are noteworthy but three who have gone through a bit of development. Those three went from misunderstood or whiny little kids, into pretty recognizable characters. But its hard to say I will remember any of them after about a year after watching. They just don\\'t stand out.\\nOverall I\\'d say I enjoyed the show. The show definitely shined in some areas, especially presenting the life of monsters and what they will do to defend themselves. They use it as a way to establish an emotional connection to their actions and the actions are definitely conveyed to the viewer. It definitely helps give some variety and life in the world the show presents. And compared to other anime, it uses the monsters as somewhat of a moral \"wall\" rather than a physical one that the protagonist just has to mow through (looking at you Sword Art Online).', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1f8a06b9f5c1aa001d0a9ea9679740de'}>,\n",

Everything is 10/10.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is an anime adapted from the LN. It's about a number of people awakening into a fantasy type world, not remembering anything but their names. The strange red moon didn't help their uneasiness either. The rest of the synopsis speaks for itself.\\nHowever, as stated, the leftover team that was formed couldn't even defeat the weakest of monsters. Adapting to the world they were living in was a struggle as well.\\nBut that's what's so great about this anime. This anime greatly displays\\nrealistic interactions, the differences of each character, their strengths and weaknesses, etc. They take each character at the beginning and show you what they're like, then throughout the series you gradually see them improve and by the end they're a whole new person.\\nIt shows that not everyone agrees with each other, has a different view on things, and some may not like others. They're not going to be crazy strong in the beginning. They're not going to go along with everything.\\nAnother thing that this anime displays is that not everyone survives. I'm not going to go into detail about that since it would be a spoiler, but as I've kept saying so far, the great thing about this gem is that it's so realistic.\\nHowever, if you don't like slow-paced stories and would suit in for something more like SAO where the MC is overpowered in the beginning for no reason, then this anime isn't for you.\\nAnd for everyone that keeps saying that there is no ''point'' in this anime, well of course they're not going to have any sort of goal in the beginning. Their goals are thought of later on as they perserve through the world of Grimgar.\\nAnother good thing about this anime is the fights. It's not just them fucking people up for no reason. Each fight tells the ups and downs and the characters train of thought on how to deal with it, along with how they feel throughout the whole thing.\\nThe music is great. In episode 11, the music was one of the things that got me so hyped besides what was happening. The music is fitting in this anime and goes along well with the scenes.\\nOverall, this anime is quite enjoyable if you don't like bullshit reasoning and like slow-paced anime where the characters aren't some OP bad ass, but rather a human being that's trying their best to adapt after being thrown into a world with no memories of where they previously were, and how they deal with it along with what's to come and improve throughout it all.\\nStory: 10.\\nArt: 10.\\nSound: 10.\\nCharacter: 10.

It\\'s a valid complaint, and I can see why some people would be put off by it. However, I personally enjoy taking my time and being immersed in the atmosphere of the world of Grimgar, and it\\'s refreshing to be able to do this without having the plot constantly at the forefront of the episode the entire time.\\nThere are also a few continuity flaws, but the story is largely consistent and believable. In addition, the pace picked up considerably near the end in order to wrap up the season due to its 12 episode length. Whoever made this design decision needs to rethink their priorities, as an anime at such a slow pace coupled a short 1-cour season can never go well together.\\n9/10\\nART\\nThe watercolour art is superb, almost to the point where I find myself calling almost each scene in Grimgar a visual masterpiece. There is a lot of detail and foreshadowing behind the art, complementing well with the story and character development.\\n10/10\\nSOUND\\nNot much to say for this one. The soundtrack is amazing, and fits the show perfectly.\\n10/10\\nCHARACTER\\nA lot of emphasis is placed on character development in Grimgar. Each character is filled with personality, intrigue, strengths and flaws, and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar make an effort to show this, whether it be their hobbies, recreation, their likes/dislikes, their feelings etc.\\nCharacter development is very closely tied into the story, making Hai to Gensou no Grimgar not unlike the animes in the Slice of Life genre. This is not necessarily a bad thing.\\nHowever, I did find the characters\\' personalities hard to believe at times. Ranta, for example, should\\'ve been put in his place a lot more often. Shihoru, while not as bad, sometimes lacked reason behind his judgement. This is, of course my personal opinion and other people will probably think otherwise.\\n8/10\\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT\\nDespite some continuity flaws and a couple unrealistic characterisation, I largely enjoyed Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.\\nHowever, this is not everyone\\'s anime. If you enjoy instant gratification, action scenes and more traditional shounen anime, you probably won\\'t like this. But if you\\'re willing to take the time to immerse yourself and notice the finer details, this is a gem that you will appreciate.\\n9/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '371546a5ed9fa7ac933596c0b6cb844f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Fantasy is a genre that can take on a number of forms.  As fantasy can only be limited by the imagination, a whole variety of shows and mediums exist to satisfy the endless fantasy craze.  And so, to go back to the dungeons and dragons kind of fantasy, we have Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.  A show that would focus on the boring math and/or rules part of a D&D game more so than its actual fun, fantasy part.\\nStory:  The world of Grimgar is wrought with danger.  Upon being summoned to a a new world, a group of newcomers find\\nthemselves in a new world where goblins, dragons, and demons exist.  In order to survive in this world, they need money.  And to get money, they have to kill monsters.  These people are told to become part of the volunteer army to help aid in saving the town from monsters.  It is here where we meet Haruhiro, a young man who with the help of some other otherworlders, begin their quest to try and survive in this unforgiving world.\\nGreat setup, right?  Outsiders looking in, a story where we can see our main character grow and prosper?  Good stuff right?  Except we don\\'t get that.  Oh no, no we don\\'t.  At its core, grimgar is what I would describe as a story wrapped around style over substance.  While the story does follow the concept of \\'becoming an adventurer\\' like many similar stories of this nature, it has far too many problems with its execution to even make it seem worthwhile to even watch.\\nThe biggest culprit to the story is Grimgar\\'s complete and utter lack of proper pacing.  A story involving adventuring usually comes with a balance of reward and defeat.  Moments where the characters succeed and get rewarded for winning, as well as moments of defeat where the loss is so severe that it impacts the characters greatly.  Grimgar does one, but not the other.  The show has a lot of moments where we do get to see the characters fail.  Very often do these characters fail more than they succeed, and that really hammers in the point that they are beginners and are learning to survive in this society.  Personally, I find that to be a more realistic point of view, since generally, it is seen that you lose more than you succeed.  The problem is, we never GET to see them succeed.  Often times, the show uses monologues and montages to show that they\\'re doing well.  In total, this only takes up a small fraction of the runtime in comparison to the gigantic amount of suffering that these characters have to endure.  Because there is a lack of balance in this regard, it\\'s very hard to even sympathize with them because there\\'re no happy moments to relate to whenever things are going bad.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.  They\\'re always in this perpetual traumatic state and it just gets annoying.\\nPacing also has an impact on the overall structure of the anime.  Grimgar wastes a lot of time.  And I mean A LOT of time.  There are many cases where the anime runs circles around itself to keep shoving its philosophy and hardship of life down your throat constantly in addition to spending entire half episodes to show nothing but soundless moments where the characters do random shit around town with happy music in the background.  There are a few choice moments in the anime that I think really are great moments, but all of that glory is just wasted potential amidst a slew of the show constantly flitting away its runtime with worthless pieces of scenery.\\nAnother smaller, but still present aspect of the story is the supposed romance.  It\\'s a lot of back and forth with this topic and I personally would\\'ve preferred if they didn\\'t even try to hint at it altogether.  They showcase \\'feelings\\' from one character to another, and it really just doesn\\'t make any sense.  It\\'s subtle, but it\\'s still present, and I wish it wasn\\'t there.\\nAnd then we get to the philosophy.  God, it\\'s annoying.  Post episode four, the show really tries to drive home how important people are and how hard the idea of loss is.  The show wants you to pity these characters, and it\\'s understandable; they\\'ve been through a lot.  For the REST OF THE SERIES?!  The ending also doesn\\'t really do the anime many favors because the show just sort of gives up and makes these still would-be beginners, especially the main protagonist, into these plot armor covered characters where apparently, killing off more than one person in this series would be a sin.  In short, the story had a lot of potential, and had many different ways to go with it, as the series clearly had the \\'evil mobs\\' form their own societies, making you question the moral qualities of killing creatures that never hurt you, but no, it\\'s just trying to make you feel pity for these characters and that is just not good writing.\\nOverview:\\n+  Great story potential\\n-   Too much suffering, not enough reward.  (Even though it was clear that they were doing well, they just choose not to actively show it.)\\n-   Wasted too much time\\n-   Unneeded supposed romance aspect\\n-   Stop shoving your goddamn philosophy down our throats\\nCharacters:  Oh boy, where do I start?  The characters in Grimgar are made to never grow up.  From the very start of the series to the end, none of them really show any form of positive growth due to their inherent traits and constant turmoil of pity.\\nThis time, I\\'m going to group them all into one big pile.  Because honestly, there\\'s nothing really interesting about any of them.  Haruhiro is our protagonist with basically no qualities to him.  Yume is the ranger who\\'s half-tsun (sort of).  Shihoru is the busty shy girl whose timidness is infuriating to watch.  Ranta is that one asshole you want to beat the shit out of cause he thinks he\\'s better than anyone else.  Mogozu is the big teddy bear tank guy who lives carving wood and cooking.  And really...that\\'s about it.  All of these characters have some irritating trait about themselves that make them unlikable.  What\\'s even more annoying is the fact that the show doesn\\'t even try to break them out of their shell.  While there is still noticeable differences from the beginning to the end, they don\\'t grow out or move on with their lives, or even remotely change as characters.  More or less, they just know and/or tolerate each other more to the extent that they seem different, but they really don\\'t change overall.\\nThe people that do have special mention however, are the healers Manato and Mary.  These two are more or less the equivalent of plot devices for the series, as they are the causation for the irritating and constant philosophy and the person that they shove said philosophy onto later in the series.  They are more or less the reason as to why or how the series is the way it is, since the show puts far too much focus on them more than anyone, and as a result, takes away from what the show could\\'ve been.\\nThe side characters are pointless.  There are a very small amount of them, and none of them have any grave significance that makes the show better or worse.\\nOverview:\\n-  Completely unlikeable cast\\n-  Healer characters hinder the plot to become what it is\\n-  Side characters are completely pointless\\nArt:  Now the art...the art is something I can get behind.  Produced by A-1 Pictures, Grimgar has a much different style of art than most anime.  The characters are simple enough to look aesthetically pleasing but also detail who and what they are.  (I.E.  Who is the mage, the thief, etc.)  The effects and the overall fluidity of the animation is also relatively nice, so much so that I really don\\'t have any complaints to the series in that regard.\\nBut the one thing that stands out to me about the artstyle are the backgrounds.  The backgrounds are made out to be this beautiful watercolor style that just looks so stunning.  It made any moments where they wasted look SO much more worth to watch in comparison to the series\\'s complete lack of ANYTHING happening at times.  Overall, the art is by far the best part of this anime, just simply because of how unique and how well done it was made.\\nOverview:\\n+  Simple but well made character designs\\n+  Watercolor backgrounds\\nSound:  The sound is also an aesthetic that is worth mentioning.  The OP is a mixture of folk and action that...while sounds good, personally isn\\'t a kind of music or track that I would personally spend my time listening to.  It\\'s good, but not memorable.\\nThe ED is this slow song that spends more time focusing on the sad, more depressing side of Grimgar (which is everywhere), with a track that focuses more on vocals and sad guitar.  Like its OP, it\\'s a good track, but in retrospect, not a soundtrack that I found to be truly memorable or worth mentioning.\\nOverview:\\n+  Good OST\\n-   Not really that memorable\\nPersonal Enjoyment:  (Warning: Rant ahead)  Oh boy, Grimgar.  Where do I start with you?  I liked you.  I really...wanted to like you at the beginning.  But ever since Manato died...you have NEVER....STOPPED....TALKING....OR COMPLAINING...ABOUT...HIS GODDAMN...DEATH!  I have never been so annoyed with someone dying that I wanted to kill the characters within the show itself.  It is fine to mourn; I\\'d be heartless to say that you can\\'t.  But Grimgar spent so much time saying \"What would Manato do?\", \"How would Manato solve this issue?\"  Manato, Manato, MANATO, MANATO, GAH!!!  (Oh yeah, and you can go to hell too, Ranta.)\\nDid I like this anime?\\nJust like Manato, any respect I have for this anime is dead.\\nWhat didn\\'t I like about this anime?\\nThe characters and the story were insufferable.  The art and music...yeah, they\\'re ok.\\nWould I recommend this anime?\\nPersonally, I would suggest you stay away from this.  The show is slow to an extent that it hurts the show more than it helps.  With the show making us spend its entire runtime feeling pity on the characters, I couldn\\'t help but be annoyed and instead, want them to die rather than to live.  It sounds heartless, but when they\\'re characters that don\\'t exactly know how to move on from an event that happened ages ago, then you\\'ve got a problem.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '630c332b57c70fef170282f713e18f22'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I thought this anime was going to be like SAO, Log Horizon, Vanadis or some such. You know, like an RPGish anime with a fantasy setting? With lots of action, some laughs and some interesting background story.\\nBut what I got instead was a day time soap opera masquerading as anime.\\nNearly all the episodes in this anime revolves around these characters walking around and talking about their \"feelings\". I\\'m not kidding. You got one girl who cries all time, 2.5 people playing tsundere (1.5 too many) and a main character who\\'s got a whinny \\'woe is me attitude\\' all day long.\\nAnother thing is that\\nthe characters are all pretty stupid.

Does this sound like something you want to watch? No, at least it wasn\\'t for me.\\nAnother thing I should mention is the story. Or rather the total lack of it. In the beginning it seems all the characters was transported from the modern world into this fantasy setting world. Right that could be interesting.... But then it\\'s never mentioned again. WTF is that all about huh? You might as well have them be born in the fantasy world to begin with! Then the characters just grind goblins til the end of the anime.

       "  <Document: {'content': '\"I pity the fool...\"\\nThis quote encapsulates everything Grimgar is about. It\\'s a poor attempt at engaging an audience with oversaturated \"emotions.\" Anime as a medium is known to depict emotions that otherwise would be impossible in live action series or tv shows. It\\'s through the artwork and animation that gets through to the viewer, not overly dense scenes. Dense is somewhat of an understatement for this series, as EVERY scene seems to take AGES for it to progress because a group of what I assume to be adults can\\'t move on from a certain scene. It\\'s incredibly cumbersome to have everything revolve around this one\\nscene and doesn\\'t improve the characters or the story. Actually it stagnates the story while keeping the characters as bland as ever. There are some ill advised scenes too, that are so boring to watch that you may finish a game of solitaire before the scene comes back to characters interacting. An incredibly poor attempt at creating a mellow atmosphere and setting. Pity is a strong word for this series, mainly because if the viewer either feels this or doesn\\'t will change everything.\\nOne of the many problems with Grimgar is it\\'s point of origin. Y\\'know it\\'s common for MMORPG settings for anime to create a how and why for characters in a brand new world. Here everything is wonky and decides we\\'re here because. Cool? Then it decides to have INCREDIBLY slow pacing. Scenes that are meant to develop the world e.g boring music playing in a slide show do not develop it. Showing different parts of the city doesn\\'t help with knowing what it is sorry to break it to ya A-1. While the story moves on slowly, so do the characters. Grimgar has the slowest first two episodes I\\'ve seen to date. Unfortunately, the main cast of characters can\\'t seem to move along the story because every interaction is one looking at another for 20 seconds thinking about what to say, and then \"never mind.\"\\nAs if the story couldn\\'t be slower, one scene comes through and everything falls apart from there. Characters become awkward and stiff, interactions are at a standstill, story goes nowhere, and all the viewer can do is either pity the characters or shrug it off. Whether you fall into one or the other will determine how you feel about the series in general. The show tries to hard to get the viewer to make you feel some type a way. To center the story around emotions is NOT how you grab and maintain a viewer\\'s attention. To make it worse, the introduction of a character increases the slow pacing, with trying to you guessed it, create a sad backstory that makes us pity the character. There really is no plot so to speak, more like separate character arcs that take time to solve. Time is Grimgar\\'s biggest enemy, and I mean it\\'s allocated time to certain scenes, certain arcs, and the uneven screen time of it\\'s main cast of characters.\\nOn the surface level, the characters of Grimgar have good characterization and distinct personalities, but the way they mesh together is awful. I mean there is a hole between the male and females that they can\\'t even interact with each other because their some uncomfortable. \"but it\\'s realistic\" may seem like an argument for this, but when the story takes itself seriously with the kill or be killed aspect of the world, having these failing relations is not very feasible in these circumstances. But anime fans are weird, whenever heart wrenching scenes happen, they eat it up and claim that the respective anime is great. These poor character relationships continue until the very end of the show, so expect a lot of arguing, disagreeing and trying to solve a problem that doesn\\'t exist. Everyone has a chip in their shoulder and everything comes back to \"the scene.\" Ultimately, characters depend far too much on one character and everything is stagnant until the final arc, where the characters take a 180 degree turn in terms of resolve and personality. Essentially, the pacing is the issue which hinder the characters from being good.\\nThe animation is good, action scenes aren\\'t so abundant but they are nice choreographed and smooth. Transitions are good, settings are vibrant, gore is okay, and they add to the tension whenever there is. More often than not, there was no music playing but when there was it\\'s okay. Nothing good, nothing bad per se but again, there were lackluster scenes with just music playing that tried to create a calm atmosphere.\\nGrimgar was a boring watch. It didn\\'t have anything going for it besides a few characters and it was a mix bag even then. One could argue half the cast is good, the whole cast is good or bad, but ultimately the stagnant nature of the story and characters creates no attachment to them. Their dependence on one character stopped them from passing the threshold of good. Emotions also doesn\\'t make a show good, it\\'s okay to make the viewers feel bad for the characters, but doing it the point where it stunts the growth of them is a poor way to handle them. Deus Ex Machina doesn\\'t help the show either. It may have been foreshadowed, but it was a weak attempt at it and the conclusion was ultimately a let down. It\\'s just another one of the \"MC is super awesome\" moments where apparently the conflict is solved due to some BS nature of the MC. Overall, I didn\\'t feel any pity towards the characters due to their lackluster interactions and thought process, none towards the \"sad\" story of Grimgar, and none towards whoever likes this.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd6b11835bbfc26fb67e8f9b0c7d941db'}>,\n",

For example, aiming for wrist, grappling is something sword fighters do, it\\'s not just grand scale battles or flashy sword moves that makes intriguing battles.

Nowadays, there are a lot of viewers who dislike the isekai premise that is set in a MMORPG world since it\\'s everyone is familiar with at least one of those games and wish to be in it. In other words, isekai is fan-service in term of worldbuilding because the author doesn\\'t actually need to create a fictional world from the ground up and majority of the audience relate to that wish-fulfilling premise. Expositions are also given an easy way out since the main character have a reason to ask everything in a boring tavern/coffee shop conversation.

The approach it took with telling the story made it slightly different than other shows in its caliber. Grimgar's take on the fantasy-adventure genre was quite serious and down to how real it could possibly get. You only get once chance in life. There are no checkpoints. There are no re-dos. And you are not Natsuki Subaru.\\nWith a lot of other shows exaggerating the durability of their characters, it's refreshing to see how the story gives emphasis to the frailness of life despite the fact it is an issekai anime. Real world concepts and rules being applied to the world of Grimgar made it so much more relatable and personal. The characters don't have plot convenience and plot armor backing them up. Their world relies on chance and wits. Their thrill and fear, you can feel and sympathize. The story telling and character development worked so well together that it made its cliche story, good.\\nArt (5/10):\\nThe emphasis and detail was consumed by the characters. Character development was really important with how the story progressed. Character expressions were smooth and very expressive. If the character art was all I that I would rate, it would get a 9/10. But, taking into account the background art... well...\\nThe background was lackluster. There was so little detail given to it that it got to the point where it was distracting and clearly on a lower level with the characters' animation. There were certain parts in the story where the background clearly mattered but the art did not match its importance.\\nSound (8/10):\\nThe music was good. The background music was also notable. There were however, certain scenes where it wouldn't hurt to add some background music.\\nCharacter (9/10):\\nCharacter development was on par with its story. These two elements complemented each other and would be the greatest strength this anime had. I admired how every character in the main group was unique and how they were each given enough time to develop.\\nTheir motif was not spoon fed to the viewers. And in the end, I wasn't still sure as to what a couple of characters were trying to do but the show left it open for interpretation. I kinda just wished that they didn't do that.\\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\nOverall (8/10):\\nThe show didn't end on a high note but it was satisfying. I was a little bothered with the pacing but, I also didn't feel that it deserved to be dragged on any longer or to get another season. What it gave me right now was enough but not enough for me to fawn over it. For a personal preference, I would've wanted more of the protagonist's love interest to bloom.\\nThis show is a more serious take on the issekai genre and I would recommend anyone interested in such to watch it. Gore and violence are kept to a minimum and over bearing characters are nowhere to be found (sort of).\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '786360b2d9e25d9c52b6c340ec03a718'}>,\n",

Also, Shiharu is the only actually boring character aside from her thiccness.\\nToken meat stick I guess.\\nBut yea, They honestly were nuanced in certain ways and felt like they got overlooked, 9/10.\\nStory: I think I like it, But I have the most issues with this.\\nThe world is fun enough, The background that makes the town seem like they just built houses wherever they would fit and to many people were there for them to change it so it just kinda stayed clustered was really fun and Japanese esque while being fantasy as fu*k, And how leveling is based primarily on silver and how they give it just enough attention to seem feasible but not quite enough to get trite and overcomplicated. And how everyone\\'s guild experience aside from Haruhiro\\'s is implied rather than spoken which leads to some really natural and fun dialogue.\\nNow there are also things I don\\'t like. Manato\\'s death is shoved down your throat for the entire show when we didn\\'t have enough time with him to care that much, And it goes on till way after they are adequately independent and eeking out a living. And when they fight Mary\\'s friends, That was poorly choreographed and poorly animated in comparison to the rest of the world, They all come out in a group of 3 and get into stance despite being zombies yatta yatta complaint complaint the scene was trash moving on.\\nIn all honestly, the point of the story to me, Was different then to other people. To me it represented young adults trying to find their place in a confusing world, I relate to it even more than when I first watched it as I\\'m 18 now, And I find the concept of going out into the real world right after coming to the conclusion that my role-models are still just as lost as I am despite being twice my age, Kind of like everything familiar just... Vanished.\\nThe characters in this show are in the same predicament, However, they don\\'t writhe, They struggle, They cry, But they have hobbies, Laugh, Work with people they don\\'t like, Deal with depressing moments and try their best, They aren\\'t revolutionary characters who will change the world, And they don\\'t need to be, Cause that\\'s not the point to me or them, It\\'s watching them struggle but enjoy doing it despite the tribulations, The unimportance to some is the show\\'s the biggest flaw, But to me its the show\\'s biggest strength.\\nOverall, 8/10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '18ca60df68da3b99cc86e764042d963e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, my pleasant surprise of the winter season; nice, thoughtful and... weird. It's hard to not make comparisons when we speak about an anime like this, but Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is, without any doubt, a good example of how SAO should have been: much more leisurely, natural and realistic. The peculiarity of the anime is, above all, the way it shows such a typical theme as adventures in a fantasy world (we have already seen it in lots of books, movies...). This time, it is focused on the process, the bad and good little moments, the progressive adaptation in\\na new and unknown world, the friendship, born by the need to survive, work together and  go to the dungeon  just because you need to earn some money to eat.\\nGrimgar is not trying to tell you about the adventures of a knight in epic battles facing legendary beasts; it aims to take you on the role of a group of teenagers: normal people, like us, dragged by force to an unknown world where they are forced to kill to survive, where adventure and fantasy became less important when you realized that, either a goblin or a human, you have to take another life to save yours. It's you or him, natural selection.\\nThe unpleasant feeling of cutting a bone, murdering asleep enemies in cold blood, the tension of a real battle in which you are aware that it might be the last one. Grimgar wants you to empathize with the characters, to identify yourself with them; it wants you to know how it feels to be in that situation. Its interest in the life and emotions of the main characters is, above adventure and action, what characterizes Grimgar.\\nI cannot finish without mentioning its artistic section, its drawings, its great animation, the watercolor-painted scenes, its limited but beautiful soundtrack used to present the different places... Grimgar is, above all, a beautiful and artistic anime, which uses its music and designs to create scenes that, sometimes, are just trying to make you think and stay gawking at the screen when there is nothing really happening; maybe that is its main fault and also its great virtue: its slow pace and the daily situations that can make some people get bored and some people get wonder.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Ever since SAO there has been many trapped-in-an-MMO spawned as a result in recent years. The main appeal of these type of shows comes in the form of high stakes.  A death in-game is equivalent to dying in real life.\\nFrom episode one this show sets itself apart from it\\'s spiritual predecessors. The cast of characters are afraid of their environment but are also incompetent in fending for themselves. They fail at killing a low-class goblin multiple times! This works insofar as character deaths are logically believable because the protagonist and his group of friends have no idea what they are doing.\\nTo be honest,\\nI usually wouldn\\'t watch a show like this of my own volition. I was sold on the series when I heard it was \"gritty\". If I had to describe this series, gritty, is the last word I would use. I will not hold it against the series just because it did not hold true to my expectations. What I can hold against it, is that the conflict of this series is incredibly repetitive. The characters level up, fight stronger monsters, and surprise surprise find themselves in a dangerous situation where they may or may not live.\\nAs far as the characters... flat anime tropes done a million times before( and probably better). The show tries to flesh out all of these characters, so an A for effort I guess. There is one character worth noting. That character is Ranta, the hotheaded side character who comes across as cynical and confrontational. I wish the series went farther with his character, he is so confrontational it borders on psychopathic and I wanted the show to explore him in detail. Nope! Turns out he is just passionate with a heart of gold... Sigh\\nI did enjoy this show. It serves as a solid action adventure. The only problem is that it also wants to pack an emotional wallop and has way too much cliche drama. The music sounded similar to Kozue Takada( sadly it was not). Although it was not it still sounded easy on the ears.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'No Spoilers...\\nFirst of all this is the only reason why I have registered and signed up to this site, simply to write a review on this anime.\\nS T O R Y: 10/10\\nMy pet peeve from Anime is rushed, unrealistic meaningless plots with no build ups. However \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" doesn\\'t do this. To be honest at first I felt it was so slow because of the level of excellence they were putting into the story build up. This is definitely a risk competing in the market of quick profitable \\'B\\' grade animes with a lot of fan service. I guess I was\\nso conformed to this style of anime that I was at first bothered by the slow story line.\\nAfter SAO Ive been pretty much watching every single RPG type anime. I do like the idea of certain ways of doing things, but by far I found this one the most original. It had the values of a RPG but it is within the setting of real life consequences. For example: typical RPG anime tends to get the main character OP, or they some how posses a ridiculous rare item or weapon of some sort which gives them an advantage. Also they are teamed with probably the strongest or unique individuals in the game. Everything is efficient, such as spoils you win from battle somehow goes straight to your invisible inventory. The beasts/ enemies you fight distribute no real consequences. In \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" you see non of that. Its like living a non-fictional concept in a fictional setting. Such as a single arrow can actually kill someone (which is relatively true in the real world). A sharp weapon is as strong as any cool looking rare legendary swords, meaning they can both kill. I also appreciated how they incorporated the level of reality in a daily persons life in this. For example, they portrayed the reality of providing food for the table takes work and effort. You have to go kill goblins or wild beasts. However the beast dont just die from a slash. They would start running away if they get scared or injured, thus you have the chance of loosing your bounty. Also they carry emotion and they too show the complex personality as any other individual creature and not a simple AI. They show hate, fear, horror, sorrow, joy, excitement and they too don\\'t want to die! These all play into account to stimulate the complexity of life for the audience to contemplate as they are put in the lenses of the characters.\\nAnother thing I really enjoyed was how real relationship was portrayed in this anime. What I mean by this is that \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" really emphasize how hard it is working with real people and building relationships, just like it would be in the real world. Misunderstandings, assumptions, expectations, responsibilities, lack of character, personality types and there clashes, being introverted vs extraverted, being patient, when to speak when not to speak, believing the best for one another regardless the situation, the importance of clear and integral communication, the list goes on. It really showed the realness of hardship and the beauty of working with other people.\\nA R T: 10/10\\nI believe Anime in general should be pleasing to the eye. What I mean by this is that anime in general should carry out the form of art that can not be manufactured in any other film hence we turn to Anime to receive this satisfaction. \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" does just this with one of the most unique style of anime art I have seen. Its simply beautiful. Of course by no means I\\'m saying that it is THE best, because styles of art can differ in categories, such as Hayao Miyazaki works! However the quality of each background, character movements to the natural lightings sets this anime apart from many others.\\nO V E R A L L: 9.5/10\\nThe reason why I\\'m giving 9.5 instead of a 10 is because the anime was so short. 12 episode is definitely not enough nor justice to the level of potential this anime carries. There is so much unanswered questions. Its almost just barely the tip of the iceberg.

Before you decide to not watch this anime, I would like to tell you why you should watch this!\\nI shall start off with the low-down of my review, and if you are interested in the general (hopefully spoiler-free) reasons why I like this, please do so. :)\\nReview Summary:\\nI enjoyed this anime because I liked seeing the changes the characters go through.\\nI enjoyed the ending of the anime. It really had a good ending, and it just warms my heart.\\nThe action scenes were pretty sweet!\\nAnd the art is beautiful.\\nAnd now for the longer, but hopefully quick breakdown of my rating:\\nStory: 8/10\\nWe find our protagonists\\nin a strange situation. Unlike some other similar anime, this one has a different take on it. There is a focus on the mental processes of the characters, and also on action scenes. Okay, the story does get sentimental, and you may cry a bit. But please watch through the entire series. It's a bit slow for me, and it's not entirely original, but it's still well thought out.\\nArt: 10/10\\nCharacters are well designed, and each has a unique look to them. The watercolours used in the setting are stunning. It's like a watercolour anime. The colours used seem to be of a lighter palette, but there are a lot of darker colours in certain scenes to match the mood.\\nSound: 10/10\\nThe OP, ED, and ambient music are soothing vocals. I could listen to both the OP and ED for a long time...\\nCharacter: 10/10\\nIf you like dynamic characters, there is so much character growth, it's like watching real people grow. Oh. Well hopefully this isn't a spoiler, but there is growth. Growth is good. I also mentioned the character designs are pretty cool. Even the side characters are pretty interesting!\\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\nSo at first I would give this anime a low rating, but after watching the whole series, it's definitely a 10. The emotions and action both sweep me off my feet!\\nOverall: 10/10\\nOkay, this anime has to be between 9 and 10 out of ten. Considering I rated 4 out of 5 of the other catagories 10/10... This anime is definitely one of those anime where you either love it or hate it.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'It should go without saying that “trapped-in-another-world” anime are pretty common these days. Most of them tend to focus on the protagonist becoming either the savior of the world or some awesome badass gifted by the gods with a unique power. It makes sense, given that they were pulled into this world for some reason, but it tends to become easily predictable and formulaic.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash), which aired in January of 2016, is different in that it follows the ordinary young men and women that end up trapped in their world, without the skills or anything special going\\nfor them (in the beginning at least). The grounded setting that follows their daily life as they work to make a living has made it one of my favorite anime this year.\\nThe foundation of the story is your stock and standard “trapped-in-another-world” plot that is all too common. However, in this case the time-tested foundation is used to build a rather solid and intriguing story that explores how ordinary people would slowly adapt to their setting by showing us just how glamorous that sort of life is if you only have ten silvers to your name, a week of training under a guild, and no way to return home, in a more cynical setting without getting too grim-dark.\\nThe setting is fairly firmly set in a fantasy world, it’s even in the name of the show. However, unlike most shows of this nature, it does a fantastic job of establishing early on that life is rather hard for those that live in it. The people aren’t exactly friendly and virtually everything costs money, meaning that if you want to live you have to work.\\nThe characters are unabashedly human in how they behave. They’re not just archetypes that spout out heroic lines and do things for the sake of justice. They do what they have to in order to live, while sharing different opinions on it.\\nThe animation is fluid, watercolor backgrounds, the fight scenes are done quite well when they don’t just show a still of the characters performing a technique and giving a lecture on it in the narration, and you can feel just how clumsy they are at first. There are some scenes that could be better, but it’s nothing horrible. And the music carries the tone of the show, a somber tune during the depressing moment and a placid tone during their valued downtime.\\nOverall, Grimgar is a Fantasy anime that has many things that I love. It is a story with a rather simple and narrow plot, people who land in a new world and adapt to it over the course of a few months. The wheels that turn the world, overarching debates on morals, and grand battles are left out of the equations to give it a more grounded exploration of these characters and the immediate setting they live in, but doesn’t shy away from the very real, very human consequences of their mistakes and actions.\\nIf you’ve got a free day, go out and watch it where you can.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'fd2aaf9f62b2d77a466cc41c9b6fb3b4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I\\'ll start off by saying this anime is slow, I\\'m talking crippled snail kind of slow. So if you can\\'t deal with slow anime, then you\\'re best making a U turn and leaving, this anime is not for you.\\nNow onto the actual review.\\nStory:\\nThe story is a fairly standard \"Stranded in a fantasy world, we must survive.\", however there is a lot of time where nothing happens to drive the plot forward, but instead shows the daily lives of the characters. There are of course action sequences, the killing of orcs and goblins and such, much like you\\'ve come to expect from any kind of action/fantasy\\nanime. The overall story seems to be mainly driven by the characters, with the overarcing story taking a back seat in order for the characters to take the spotlight.\\nArt:\\nThe art is phenomenal. If you were to completely disregard the story and characters, and you just watched this for the landscape shots I think it\\'d be worth your time. The backdrops all seems to have been domne in water colour or a similar medium which is very interesting.\\nSound:\\nI had to go back and watch a few episodes to get a feel for the audio since nothing stuck out for me, but going back and purposefully listening out for the sound made me realise that everythingthat needed to be there was there. The audio for armour pieces clinking together was there, the audio for chess pieces being moved and so on, attention to detail was everywhere with audio. The background music was also good and built on the athmosphere of wthe scenes where it was used.\\nCharacters:(This will be split into two parts, Visual character design and character design.)\\nVisually, the characters are all well designed, each having thier own style and quirks. Most of the gear used by the characters isn\\'t hugely outlandish and unwieldable. A little thing I liked was that they actually carry their gear, for example Moguzo carries a large backpack while the party is out adventuring, it\\'s a small thing but it shows that they\\'re out in the wilds for a few days at least. There are no fairly generic cut\\'n\\'paste secondary characters either, even the secondary characters have been drawn well, with them all also having their own styles of gear and clothing.\\nCharacter development and the design of the personalities for the character is hands down the best part of this series. The characters are very well developed, even down to things that they do in their spare time. All the characters feel rather unique too, while watching I never thought \"Oh look, another Kirito.\" or \"That guy reminds me of Naruto.\", all the characters have very definite edges to their personalities and habits.\\nYou spend so much time with the main party, just seeing them do the menial everyday tasks people do that you can\\'t help but connect with them, even though you\\'re just seeing Moguzo buy a helmet or seeing Ranta fishing, you start to realise that these people have lives besides going out and killing orcs and dragons and this series does an excellent job of building them in that way.\\nYou also see how the characters emotionally develop as the series progresses, alongside their abilities as adventurers this really drew me in since with other \"Trapped in a fantasy world.\" anime that I\\'ve seen I didn\\'t see a whole lot of development, so this was a nice change. Our protagonist also has a pretty interesting way of looking at things, so his internal monologue has some good moments of sarcasm.\\nSomething that particularly made me happy with the characters is that a \\'small cut\\' will seriously hurt, and put them out of action, and losing blood is a somethig that can incapacitate them ((Looking at you Bleach)), and that the main party has no idea how to fight when they first enterthis fantasy world, as most of us wouldn\\'t have any idea with how to start with magic or sword play except \\'Hit them with the sharp bit\\'.\\nEnjoyment:\\nAs mentioned earlier, if you don\\'t like slow anime then you won\\'t enjoy the story progression, as whole episodes pass by with nothing happening; if however you like slice of life, and you enjoy seeing the characters go about their lives in this new fantasy world they\\'re in, then you will really enjoy this anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a5c64ff77ddc73d289ad5de4cd2014cf'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'From what I\\'ve seen, it\\'s pretty obligatory to say that this is my first review, and with that said, take into account that my review isn\\'t necessarily indicative of how you may feel, and at the end of the day it\\'s all entirely subjective.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, or Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a tough anime to review, because on one hand it does a lot of great things that you don\\'t see very often in the medium, especially within the fantasy-RPG genre, but on the other hand, it\\'s definitely not something I could recommend to absolutely everyone. So to really kick things\\noff, I want to start with what, in my opinion, are the positives.\\nPROS:\\nAt first glance, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is seemingly yet another fantasy based anime, borrowing elements from well established MMO mechanics such as partying up, completing dungeons, learning skills, and having specific class roles. So in the anime spectrum, this isn\\'t anything new, we\\'ve seen this all before from shows such as Sword Art, Log Horizon, and many others, but luckily for the viewer, this is essentially where the similarities end.\\nThe anime is heavily character driven, and I mean heavily, almost to the point where each episode more-or-less focuses entirely on diving into the psyche of our main protagonist Haruhiro, and if you\\'re reading this review, I\\'ve come to assume you\\'ve already read the synopsis so for the sake of being slightly less tangential I\\'ll spare you the details. Anyway, now this can be viewed as a good or bad thing depending on whether or not you find complex stories and or characters more preferable within what you watch. Now obviously we would prefer to have both, but if we are talking strengths, the fact that this anime not only has a main character that feels human and relatable, but also has a cast of supporting characters that are all memorable and enjoyable at least on some level is one aspect that the anime succeeded in; and trust me, in a world where you\\'ve seen hundreds of anime, it\\'s a breathe of fresh air being able to list characters off the top of my head with ease.\\nThe second aspect that Grimgar succeeds in is showing struggle. This is emphasized heavily within the first couple of episodes. This anime doesn\\'t play by the typical rules of the established shounen genre, there is no over-powered main character, and the motto of this one in-particular could be summed up with \"one mistake could get you or someone else killed.\" This constant fear and struggle that is portrayed gives the viewer a sense of suspense, you\\'re constantly critiquing every mistake that the group makes, often getting frustrated, and even a little worried about the group\\'s survival. Nothing is ever easy for them, and in the brief moments that it seems to be, we are quickly reminded by the harsh reality of this fictional universe, a reality that one mistake will essentially snow ball into another.\\nThe fact that you can visually see the growth that each character goes through, even if it\\'s simply in terms of fighting is just really enjoyable to watch. This is an aspect that makes it so heavily relatable, all of the characters start off absolutely terrible at everything, and I mean terrible. They are uncoordinated, hesitant, often stumbling over each other, and even having quite a few communication issues. As the show goes on though, little by little, these issues disappear, or become at least less obvious. It feels like you\\'re there right with them, following their journey and many failures, and also being there to see the accomplishments that they work so hard to achieve. The anime also focuses on little things, such as mannerisms, body language, and so on to subtly show change without necessarily throwing it in the viewers face, and I\\'d like to think that many people prefer this method of \"show don\\'t tell.\"\\nCONS:\\nNow with the not-so-positive. With an anime that\\'s dependent on it\\'s characters and their development to keep the viewer interested, it is slightly disappointing to see only half of the cast get any real, personalized development that dives into their personalities and why they are the way they are. What\\'s even more disappointing is that even with half of the cast somewhat developed, we only get to view these characters from a first person narrative perspective, thus limiting the possibilities of really ever fleshing them out as much as they possibly could. Now to give a slightly positive retort to that though, I would say that experiencing things through Haruhiro\\'s thoughts is a great way to develop the protagonist well enough to make the audience like him, and it also gives a great psychological feel to it all.\\nThe anime is slow. Now I wouldn’t put this in the cons if it were a 24 episode series, but because of the fact that it has really prioritized the concept of gradual growth, the story suffers because of it. It’s absolutely a blast to see the characters change over time and become better, but with only 12 episodes, the story itself becomes less clear because of this. Obviously the main focus is on the characters, and I would even argue to say that this is a slice of life, but because there is no overarching theme otherwise, this could turn a lot of viewers off.\\nThere are some quirky animation issues. While some of the episodes you won’t really notice them, there are quite a few situations where characters will lose a helmet or something, and then they will magically have it again briefly, only for it to disappear once more like it should have originally. These things aren’t enough to take away from my enjoyment, but little things such as my example really shouldn’t be happening. i get that there are deadlines, people are drawing quickly, and so on, but it’s something that people will be critical of when they see it.\\nSTORY - 6\\nIf you can get past the fact that there isn’t really a world-building-grand-scheme-point to this story thus far, then it’s reasonably enjoyable. At least from the perspective of just viewing it as a simple coming of age story, but nothing that will blow you away.\\nCHARACTERS - 8\\nThis would be rated higher if they were all developed, but because it’s only half the cast, I have to dock points. The main character is great, he’s relatable, and his internal struggle feels very real. Mary and Ranta were also great, but unfortunately the rest of the cast didn’t really get the same treatment. That being said though, because they did the “show don’t tell” style for the rest of the cast, I’m willing to let some of it slide since we can experience their changes, even though there isn’t quite as much context for them compared to the primary 3 I spoke of.\\nSOUND - 7\\nNot much to say here, The opening and ending were very catchy, the voice acting seemed pretty solid, and I liked the fact that Haruhiro had a more realistic and less typical shounen protagonist voice. Otherwise, there aren’t really any songs or tunes within the show that really stood out to me.\\nART - 9\\nThe water color backgrounds were all very aesthetically pleasing, making the world deceivingly vibrant and very unique looking. Character designs, while not breaking much of the mold for the norm in terms of style, still looked great and it was nice seeing their gradual change in attire. Plus all of the characters felt very individualistic because of some subtle creative choices.\\nENJOYMENT - 9\\nI’m personally an avid fan of slow, character driven stories, and even more-so a fan of stories that have a psychological aspect to them. I liked seeing their team dynamic slowly evolve, as well as their personal interactions. The fight scenes were great to watch even with some of the animation flaws, and overall it was one of the few anime this season that I really looked forward to each week.\\nOVERALL - 8\\nEven with the issues I talked about, and others that I may have not listed, I think Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is at least something I feel everyone should give a shot. It’s simple, has a really great focus on realistic human interaction, as well as the fact that it dives into themes such as grief and how people all react differently to such hardships. The story is nothing groundbreaking, and if you can get passed the slow pace, Grimgar offers a very unique experience we don’t get too often with anime, and especially with anime within the fantasy-RPG genre.\\nThere’s so much more I could say, but hopefully this does all right for my first review.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd672688d0dfd7d254b2514e8d11aabbe'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Just a heads up, there may be some spoilers so read at your own discretion.\\nHaving finished the series completely, I noticed that there were a lot of unfair treatment to this show. To answer some of the more common complaints; Yes, it was a slow show. Yes, the characters seem a bit generic, and Yes, this show is not as flashy as we\\'d all hope in this genre. Despite all of these, I knew from the start that this was a show that I could finally appreciate. Very seldom do we see a show that actually takes the point of view of an unwilling person\\nsuddenly thrown into a completely different life style in a blink of an eye. If we compare it to say... Sword Art.. we have the main hero literally cutting through everything and just owning the scene. Here, our main character acted as if anyone one of us would if we were suddenly thrown into a \"fantasy\" world living a game-like life. I like that aspect of this show, taking the steps slowly to understand where they are and let their reality finally sink in (given the first few episodes were repeated grind on goblins).\\nMany of us if not all, have played a MMO before, and we all know that in these games, there are parts where we have to grind out experience to level up. To finally have a show break down the actual parts of leveling up, I will have to admit, it does remind me of the hours I\\'d had to put in, in order to gain a skill or level up to access the next part of the world. The pacing in this show is slow, but it\\'s slow because we see more or less the same thing over and over again. What I do appreciate, is the development of our characters as they become more comfortable with actually killing a living creature than what they felt from the start. I know for sure if I were suddenly forced to kill someone to live, I\\'d be taken aback slightly and would be hesitant. As the show went on, we actually do see the transition of what appears to be a person who has never experienced killing, or partaken in some sort of leadership role, into someone who has become dedicated to improving themselves and taking on tasks they themselves wouldn\\'t normally do.\\nBeginning with the general story line, I applaud the directors and the author of this anime/manga for taking a route that is generally less taken. Instead of rushing from one end to the other, we are taken on a path that shows the beginning or rather the creation of the \"hero\". We are on a road that shows each step by step development and eventually leading to their own triumphant goal, if only a short one. It did a solid job leading into the next episode making me wonder what\\'ll happen next.\\nSound? The music was done in a way it should be done; complimenting the scene. Granted the music may not be as memorable as some blockbuster movies or anime may be, it none the less worked out for the better.\\nThat being said, the art shown here in this show, was unique in its own aspect and was rather very soothing. To be able to look at a painting and imagine it being played in the background as part of the scenery to create the mood. The drawing of the characters were well done, and worked well with the artistic style of the background.\\nThe characters felt a bit lacking or boring, however as the show went on, we started to see slowly what is on the mind of these characters. We see transformation of each character going from being clueless to a sense of determination and growth both physically and mentally. None the less, there weren\\'t any characters that flashed out as the perfect poster child, but they did an adequate job fulfilling their role as part of the anime.\\nDespite what many may say about this show, I thought it did a great job doing progressing the story well. It\\'s not your typical hack and slash show, nor is it your typical romantic love show, but a rare breed of showing how one must adjust to an abnormal lifestyle previous of their experiences. I would have to say... a beginning of any hero in any story will always have some sort of hard upbringing, and here we see a normal group of people become a party of inseparable friends who depend on each other and look out for each other as anyone would in a violent world.\\nI\\'d like to give this show a fair 7.5/10 but to round up, it\\'ll have to be an 8 on MAL.\\nThanks for reading and do check this show out if you haven\\'t yet.\\nEdit: forgot to mention, that like most anime, it is made to sell the manga. I say it\\'s fair that this show has peeked my interest to want to know what\\'ll happen next by reading the manga aka it did it\\'s job selling the manga to me.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '59e6935f16f03634c6d18bf544309826'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Sorry for the length of this review. I tried to be concise but I had a lot to say. So, here we go ...\\nGrimgar, Ashes and Illusions [English Dub - Funimation]\\nStory [3/10]\\nThe first thing that people will tell you about this show, whether to praise or criticize it, is its pace. To say that Grimgar’s story moves slowly would be a massive understatement. At times it can feel like trying to melt a glacier with a Zippo lighter. I was reminded of the 2003 adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist while watching this show. Much like the original FMA anime in comparison to Brotherhood, Grimgar functions more\\nlike a character study rather than a conventional action (or in this case, fantasy) series. A lot of time is dedicated to evaluating how characters respond to certain events and the impact those events have on their mental and emotional wellbeing rather than focusing on the events themselves. This isn’t inherently a problem as it helps this series stand out from its contemporaries, especially in the isekai genre. The difference is that FMA had over 50 episodes to dissect its main cast while also providing a satisfying (or mostly satisfying, depending on your preference) story for those characters to operate in. Grimgar has 12. As a result, the “story” is very barebones while certain elements, like character backstories and the initial mysteries set up in the beginning of the show, are cut entirely. Our characters, along with a handful of other people, mysteriously wake up in a fantasy world with no memory as to who they are or the lives they had before. They head down to the nearest town where they are told they must fight and kill monsters as volunteer soldiers in order to make a living. They form into parties, choose a class, and with that the show hits the ground running (or casually strolling, rather). Who were they before? Where did they came from? How did they get here? What was the purpose of the tower they suddenly appeared in? Not only are none of these questions answered but the series (and characters, for that matter) don’t seem to be particularly concerned with them in the first place. If this was an element that was going to be entirely omitted and not explored in the slightest, I don’t understand why this story wasn’t a straight up fantasy.  It’s not like the isekai genre is being underrepresented at this time. Other aspects of the show, like the schools the characters got to learn skills for their class, wasn't really explored either. Neither was the town they stay in or the monsters they are fighting. In fact, once the cast accomplishes their initial goal half-way through the series, I'm not sure what the goal was after that. If I were to write out the events of the series, surprisingly not a lot actually happens. The positive thing is that each plot point is given room to breath and feels significant in the lives of the characters. The negative thing is that there just isn’t enough run-time for the series to give those characters much to do.\\nArt [8/10]\\nWhile I can definitely state that the series’ art style is one of its greatest aspects, it wasn’t something that I was sold on when I first started watching it. At first, I viewed the water-colored backgrounds in a negative light. I figured they were just a lazy way for the artists to get around making detailed backdrops and vistas. But as I thought about it more, it gives the series a similar look to how artwork is painted in fairytale books. In a way, the imagery makes it appear more fantasy than most series and it helps Grimgar carve out its own space, visually, from the rest of the series in either the iseaki or fantasy genres. There is no other show that looks just like it, and over the course of the series it grew on me to the point where I appreciate it more than any other facet of the show. The colors used are also on the lighter end of the spectrum and are very washed out. This reflects the show’s tone which is somber and melancholy without delving into the dark and disturbing esthetic that you would get from Berserk or Claymore. It’s a nice balance that few series in the fantasy genre are able to find and it’s reflected perfectly just by how the series is visually presented in practically every frame.\\nSound [6/10]\\nThe music in the show is also very melancholy, reflecting the series’ artistic style. Well, expect for the OP. I usually don’t really comment on ‘OP’s or ‘ED’s. A show’s opening and closing credits mean very little to me when it comes to a series’ overall quality, so I could care less as to whether or not I think they’re good, or the songs are catchy, or they leave a lasting impression. Therefore, I usually don’t ever mention them. But I feel like I have to mention the OP here just because of how odd it is. The song itself is fine, I guess. Perhaps maybe a little too upbeat and cheery sounding for the show’s overall tone. But the visuals are a different story. The entire OP cuts between still, water-painted pin-ups of the main cast and marbles (like the game). At first, I thought that the creators didn’t really want to waste time on an OP—hence the still images, which may have just come from leftover design sketches. But it looks like they spent a decent amount of time making some of those marble shots look really good. So … I don’t get it. It doesn’t have anything to do with the plot of the show. Maybe it’s a cultural thing that’s going completely over my head? I don’t know but, like I said, a bad (or strange in this case) OP isn’t a factor for me so I’m not going to dock the show points for that. What I absolutely am going to dock points for is the incessant monologuing. I don’t mind monologues to the audience when they are used for world building or helping the plot move along at a comfortable pace. But the main character will start spouting exposition to the audience what feels like every 2 minutes. I could understand if there needed to be a lot of exposition within the first few episodes to set up the events of the show, but 10 episodes in and he still won’t shut up. In a weird way I almost find this amusingly ironic. With how little the show focuses on a constant progression of events and the almost complete absence of backstory for the main cast, you would think that this would be the last series which would need excessive exposition. Even things that are obvious, stuff that is blatantly shown instead of stated, will still be reiterated almost as if the writers of this series are petrified that we will get lost unless we are led by the hand through the story. It’s a shame because at times it can undercut the subtleties of the show’s character building.\\nCharacters [9/10]\\nThe sacrifices the show makes to its plot and world building pay off here. Each member of the main cast is given time to develop beyond being one-dimensional (admittingly, some are given more screen time than others). However, the cast still falls within pretty well-defined archetypes that we have seen many, many times before. That being said, the entirety of the cast is likable (to an extent) save for one particular member that doesn’t stick around for very long. This member is also the only one whose voice actor gave a vocal performance that was less than stellar. Which, in a way, was the saving grace of the show. After all, if I had to sit through that much monologue with a point-of-view character whose voice was subpar, I might’ve dropped the series pretty early on. The cast also share a very solid chemistry with each other which is something that a lot of other shows seem to struggle with. Lastly, the characters take full advantage of the slower pace of the show by portraying their growth into their abilities in a more realistic and believable way. Their first encounter with a basic goblin is a real struggle for them. Many of them got hurt, one of them almost died, and it took every single bit of their energy and bravery just to kill one single low-level enemy. By the end, they are carving their way through a fair number of monsters. The series gave these characters the time to grow into warriors from nothing with the feeling like they had earned their place at the top rather than giving a hand-wave explanation that they are just naturals at monster slaying.\\nEnjoyment [5/10]\\nI love that this show was able to have a serious take on the fantasy genre, with an emphasis on the personal trauma and psychological baggage of its characters, without feeling the need to go Goblin Slayer levels of dark. While the show did ultimately suffer in some crucial ways because of it, the slow pace was a breath of fresh air compared to other series lately that rush through events without ever stopping to allow the audience to absorb it or evaluate how it is affecting the cast of the show. I enjoyed the characters, I grew fond of the art style, and just when things really started to get going … it ended. And that’s the major fault of this series. In today’s age of seasonal anime, where no matter how popular or how critically well-received your show is you may not get a second season, each series has to be able to stand on its own. For all of Grimgar’s strengths, it does not. This feels like the first act to a series that may very well never come. This review is being written 3 years after the series finished airing. There is a very good chance that this is all that we will get from this world and this cast. And, if that is the case, I cannot help but feel sorely disappointed because I know that this could have been so much better and could have offered so much more.\\nOverall [6/10]\\nAt the very least, this show is unique; which is much more than I can say for many series out there—especially those in the realm of isekai. If you are looking for more of a “character focused” series and grow tired of how stale the fantasy genre has been as of late, you will have a good time with Grimgar. But if you’ve already got better shows on your backlog that are still waiting to be watched, you can afford to give this one a pass … at least for now.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '278d6208322ddafdfdf44a1238a90923'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Reviews from me are rare, but I felt that this show was greatly underappreciated and thus deserved a positive review from me.\\nFirst off, I went into this show for reasons beyond the norm.  Usually I choose what to watch in a season based on the seiyuu involved (typically male) and then gravitate to a couple more when a friend of mine says it's good.  Grimgar however I picked up for the simple reason that it was pretty.   I was drawn to the watercolor backdrops and the simplistic character designs that weren't flashy and remained down to earth, especially for a fantasy\\nanime.\\nSecondly, I'm a fantasy fan, and usually I find most fantasy anime lacking in something.  Yes we all know how much the world loves SAO but to be honest, I wasn't that keen on it.  So when we get dropped into Grimgar, I'm praying that it doesn't turn out to be some sort of parallel world where you die in the game, you die in life.\\nThird... I actually gave up this anime after episode four because I was... attached.  Those who see the series will understand what I mean without spoiling it... but let's just say I was ticked off and put off by the series.  A few months went by, I cooled off, and I started watching it again.\\nTo be honest, by the time I had finished the series, I felt refreshed.  This wasn't a show about a group of kids saving the whole entire world (like so many anime are) and this wasn't a show about unraveling a fantasy world's mysteries and how it connects to the real world (like SAO).\\nThis was a story with very deep themes including how to deal with loss, survival at it's base level, how to communicate and understand those around you, and about growing to find yourself through adversary and tragedy.  Now, maybe some people don't like deep stories... but I did.  By the time you're towards the end of the series, you too have forgotten that these people are from somewhere else and you really no longer care how they got there, much like the characters themselves.  This series was about the small struggles of day to day life set with a backdrop of fantasy and magic.  Tragedy and Triumph go hand in hand with Grimgar and the stark gravity of reality in that we are all destined, one day, to be but ash, resonates to the heart and soul.\\nSo if you're looking for something thought provoking with a dunk in the deep end of the pool... watch Grimgar.

As the characters continue to grow, it is definitely refreshing to see an anime in this genre that focuses on character development.  Keep in mind that this show has no comedy value in it.  However, it compensates greatly on the psychological aspect.  Each episode has its own deep meaning and conveys the feeling of each character to the viewer.

But for me personally, this work is absolutely gorgeous and enjoyable, but you have to stick with it.\\nStory 9/10\\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this anime's story. The beginning started slow, and continued to creep along. Then all of sudden, BAM! An unexpected twist that just comes out of the blue. It was like someone slamming the accelerator down in a car, but then just as fast hitting the brakes. The writers skillfully had you relax and watch without expectation. Then proceeded to delivered a sucker punch and I don't think anyone saw it coming. Some people would argue that the character was unimportant and lame etc. But, his....fate helped to develop the other characters substantially.\\nThe story then takes a slowish/medium pacing whilest a new character is introduced. Again, this anime is very much so focused on character development, which can take time. It continues this pace until the last episodes where they face their biggest fears and obstacles. I, once again, believe that the finale, and build up to it, were executed in a thrilling and exciting way.\\nThe story can be slow. Some might consider it to drag at points. However I believe it to be enjoyable, always looking forward for the next episode.\\nCharacters 9/10\\nCharacter development is the center of this anime. That being said, in the beginning they are all weak and somewhat fickle. Many people thought some of the characters were uninteresting, bland, and illogical at the start. However, at the end, the characters had grown strong and dependable. They somehow made you want to root for them. One of the coolest things is how the characters behave in a way that is somehow more human than other anime. They mourn when they should mourn. They're scared when it's appropriate to be scared. They are happy when times are good, but still have that gloominess that is comparable to when you have something you must do but you keep pushing it off. Most anime characters seem to be based off ideals rather than reality. I believe the characters here have a human like quality that many anime lack.\\nArt 10/10\\nThis anime is freaking gorgeous imo. It looks like it was colored with Copic markers and colored pencils. The backgrounds have a sketchy quality to them which gives it a more human feel. You would usually expect perfect straight lines which seem more computer generated than normal. The characters clothes change many times which is unusual for anime or animation in general. I found that once again, gives it that more personal feeling. The great animation is combined with great camera angles during fighting scenes makes it a joy to watch. tl;dr It looks awesome.\\nSound 9/10\\nThe soundtrack along with the voice is just amazing. The voices are again, more human-like than other anime. No ultra high pitched voices or over masculine sounding ones. They sound just..normal. The music is amazing as well. I like the calm guitar parts during dialog and whatnot which are contrasted by the fast paced rock pieces during the fight scenes. The opening and ending songs are awesome too. I especially enjoy the opening with the cool violin (probably more appropriate to call fiddle in the case) in the intro of the opening. I don't have much more to say than that I can't wait till the OST comes out :3\\nConclusion:\\nI have very much so enjoyed the ride. The story pacing was just right for the job. The characters slowly build themselves into strong ones. The art is amazing and the music is to die for. Some might find the slowness to be annoying and boring. But, you know, if everyone had the same tastes, likes or interests, it be a boring world.\\nI gave this anime a 10 because I enjoyed it so much and it really struck a chord with me and I hope it can do the same for you.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '405bc33db93862d293b7b92dc4ce6477'}>,\n",

It was a take on a fantasy world one might find in a game, but shows it from the character's perspective as a real world experience.  Imagine what it would be like to really be in a world with goblins and other gargantuan creatures like in video games with their video game powers?  Imagine that but without the possibility of being revived or being able to restart?  Thats some scary stuff.  To me, the\\ngreatest part of the anime was the ability to capture real life thoughts and feelings in a survival situation and present it in this format.  I felt compelled to finish this anime and there are many I give up on within 4 epsiodes if it develops slowly, but this is one anime of which I do not regret finishing and waiting for the climax.  The art was unique and lovely.  It showed a medival world in a style I can only word as similar to studio ghibli.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is not your typical \"Action\" and \"Adventure\" anime. This anime is a whole lot more than just \"A person getting transported into a fantasy world\" because it explored realistic themes such as poverty, survival, coping with death and etc. This show will also test your patience and I don\\'t mean that in a good way.\\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\\n[Story]: (7.5/10)\\nA group of people have been unknowingly transported into an unknown world and 6 people from the group formed a party together to survive this world where death is a high possibility and the chances of being brought\\nback to life is non-existent.\\nYou know how many times I dropped this show? Two.times. I gave this show 2 chances just so I can finish this show from start to end which is going to be the first show that I managed to finish after giving it 2 chances. Now, how is this relevant to my review, you ask? Here\\'s your answer. The reason why I dropped this show two times is that god-forsaken horrible f*cking pacing for the first 4-5 episodes. It was unbearable and and I was literally forcing myself to stay awake because my eye kept closing every minute. If you take a look at my list, you can see that I have a good track record of watching slow pacing animes and giving them a score of 9 (even Fate UBW) but Grimgar is not one of them. I understand that what Grimgar was trying to do was show how a beginner like them will do against a Goblin and what they\\'ll do to overcome that weakness but they did not do it right.\\nI can summarize to you what\\'s going to happen in the first 5 episodes. The characters have a conversation, they go out, fight a goblin, they either win or lose and they walk around the village until the episode finishes. The latter was just so badly done because what you\\'re seeing is literally just a slideshow of them walking around the village and an out-of-place insert song playing in the background. I\\'m not saying the insert song was horrible or anything..In fact, it was a great song but it was so out of place. For a dramatic song like that, I expect them to use it when someone dies but no one died in that scene. Therefor, to me, it was out-of-place.\\nRanting aside, one of the reasons why I liked about Grimgar is its realism..Even though I didn\\'t like the pacing, what I did like is how the characters don\\'t go all \"super saiyan\" mode and they don\\'t suddenly turn overpowered just for the sake of advancing the plot. Fighting in this world is extremely dangerous and characters can get hurt or die any time, no matter how important they are to the story. We see the characters planning out on how to kill the Goblins and executing said plans to achieve it and just like how life won\\'t always go the way you planned it out, the same thing happens here. Their plans can fail at any time. It\\'s also refreshing to see the characters struggling to kill a single Goblin (one of the most weakest enemies) which is a rarity in the medium. It shows us that killing a living being is not that easy. Also, just because Grimgar has similar resemblance to a RPG world doesn\\'t mean that death can be taken lightly. In Grimgar, death is final. Once they\\'re dead, they stay permanently dead with absolutely no chance of being revived.\\nAs I said above, Grimgar did a great job exploring realistic themes such as poverty, coping with death and survival. Since I already talked about the latter, I\\'ll only talk about the first two. For the first one, I never expected an anime to explore such theme. I mean, I was very surprised when I saw the characters not only struggling to fight a weak enemy due to their lack of fighting experience but to also struggle just to meet their necessities. At the end though, we see them overcome this issue by working hard, just like real life. You don\\'t just get whatever you want by doing nothing. The 2nd one is coping with death which is the main focus in the 2nd half. When Manato died in the first half, he wasn\\'t just swept out of the show just because he\\'s gone. He still played a huge role in the 2nd half, either by the way he affected the party\\'s performance or by appearing in Haruhiro\\'s imagination. It tells us that he still lives on even though he\\'s gone. The coping with death and many more aspects like the character development (which I\\'ll explain down below) was so well done that the 2nd half made me forgive the flaws that the first half had and bumped my score from 6 to 8.\\n\"Bring ooonn the fanservice!\" /sarcasm\\nThere really isn\\'t a lot of fanservice in the show but there\\'s still a few fanservice throughout the show. Half of them used as comedy and half of them focusing on Yume\\'s ass. What is it with A-1 Pictures and ass shots? In SAO II (Another show by A-1 Pictures), Sinon\\'s ass shots dominated the show and in here, Yume\\'s ass shots can be seen in almost every episode. I guess I have a new name for this show.. \"Grimgar of Yume and her Ass\".......No? I\\'ll stop.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n[Art/Animation]: (7/10)\\nThe character design may be great and the art style may be unique but this is one of A-1 Picture\\'s inconsistent animation I have ever seen. The action scenes are sometimes a pain to watch because of their use of still shots and there was one scene where the characters\\' legs weren\\'t animated and the characters looked like a bunch of cardboard cut-out going up and down to make them move.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n[Sound]: (8.5/10)\\nThere is a lot of out-of-place insert songs in this show which would explain why the animation was so inconsistent and the constant use of still shots in action scenes. They most likely blew all their budget so they could pay that girl ( (K)NoW_NAME ) who sung all of the insert songs, including the OP and ED theme songs. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\nThe OP theme song is Knew day by (K)NoW_NAME and the ED theme song is \"Harvest\" by (K)NoW_NAME. The OP theme song, for me, is just average and I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever listen to again. On the other hand, the ED theme song is one of the best dramatic song that I have ever heard. If A-1 Pictures is going to make another anime that will make people cry, they better hire (K)NoW_NAME because she can do a dramatic song that can make people cry.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\nGrimgar\\'s character growth can be explained in one word..Amazing! Unlike SAO or any other Action/Adventure Fantasy shows out there, the characters literally start out as a bunch of weak party who can\\'t even defeat one of the weakest monsters ever. As you watch the show from start all the way to the end, you\\'ll notice how much these characters have grown and it\\'s making a guy like me cry for weird and unknown reasons. It\\'s like watching your kid who can\\'t do shit to a person who can take care of himself.\\nManato\\'s death also contributed to the party\\'s growth. That is so wrong for me to say but that\\'s what happened in the 2nd half if you watch closely on how this party grew from a bunch of incompetent f*cks who can\\'t even defeat one goblin to a competent party who works together to defeat multiple goblins. That\\'s not to say they\\'ve become an overpowered party though. They just learned how to work together and how to get stronger.\\nWhen Mary joined the party, she turned out to be one of the worst characters I have ever seen.....or so I thought. I guess that\\'s what character development does to you. It explains why Mary was so cold towards her party members and why she\\'s so stubborn when it comes to healing her party members. It was a rather depressing flashback if I say so myself. Mary eventually got along with Haruhiro and his party because the party understood what was going through her mind and they helped her overcome whatever her problem is. She turned out to be one of the best and fleshed out characters I have ever seen.\\nSame goes for Haruhiro. He started out as a bland protagonist but when Manato died, it affected him greatly because he was the best leader the party had and this inspired Haruhiro to become a great leader for the party because he knows that only he can do it. He also cares about other characters\\' feelings and when Mary joined the party, it became even more noticeable that his character has great leadership skills because he cared about Mary\\'s feelings and he did everything he could to help a party member, which in this case, is Mary.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\nGrimgar pissed me off in the first 5 episodes because of how poorly the pacing is handled. By the way, this is coming from a guy who watched a lot of slow pacing animes. After 5 episodes though, the show gets a lot better and it turned out to be a good show but not the greatest.\\n______________________________________________________________\\n[VERDICT]\\n\"Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash\" managed to dug itself out of the grave after the 5th episode and turned out to be a good show out at the end. However, if you can manage to ignore the infuriating pacing at the first 5 episodes then this might be one of the best A-1 Pictures anime for you because while the story may be decent, Grimgar has one of the best character developments I have ever seen. There\\'s also Grimgar\\'s realism which is the first ever realistic Action/Adventure Fantasy anime as far as I know. If you\\'re looking for a show that has a similar premise to SAO but done better then this is the show for you.\\n[OVERALL]: (8/10)\\nPros:\\n+Grimgar\\'s realism in so many aspects\\n+Show explored realistic themes such as poverty, survival, coping with death and etc.\\n+Unique Art style and Great Character Design\\n+Amazing Character Development\\nCons:\\n-Infuriating Pacing at the first 5 episodes\\n-Out-of-place insert songs in the first half', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '216191e4a9b0165fc2635c46a5d3faf0'}>,\n",

Since the enormous success of that particular anime almost every major studio has tried to put their own spin on being trapped in an unknown world (or video game) with RPG like elements. Most of these studio's were rewarded handsomely for doing so, and thus every anime season we are now assaulted with an endless slew of MMORPG animes. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is yet another part of this tired genre, yet it contains an\\noddly fresh prospective that was refreshing, and quite frankly needed.\\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar decided to take the road untraveled in the MMORPG genre. What looks like an action, fantasy anime manifested itself in an unusually realistic and very human way. The action, and the setting are not the main story here, it is the characters, and their daily struggles. The main characters are not demi-gods out to save the world, they are weak, insecure, and are just trying to get by the best they can in a new world that they know little about. The feelings they feel, the tribulations that they face are all too real feeling. These characters felt like real, like somebody you have met, and know in real life. The pain, loss, happiness, joy and conflict that each character faces is all very real, and genuine feeling.\\nThis anime is very intimate, it is not an epic -- it is smaller in scale than any other genre of this type of anime that I have ever seen. If you're looking for fast paced action, this is not the anime for you. It is slow, and every little decision or indecision has ripple effects throughout the entire casts lives.

Which leads to the characters having to realize how they should fulfill their role in the party or what the role they are meant to fill is in the first place.\\nCharacter's physical development\\nThe character development physically is great, it's not that the characters get some over the top powerful unique skill accustomed only to them giving them the power to trounce all foes in 1 mighty blow, but instead it's moves which can be physically learnt by the more adept role carriers and actually make sense. This also leads to the point of taking damage, one thing I love about this anime is when a character is cut, stabbed or hurt, they feel it and show it, they don't ignore it like it's nothing but they have the more appropriate reactions of actually staring at the wound and looking like they're going to scream in pain or actually do scream in pain.\\nArt Style\\nThe art style differs from other animes too, it uses a nice colour pallete blend to get many different tones and shades for different scenes, and when showing the scenes themselves, they look like very nicely painted pieces of art, then adding the characters and the events of the anime gives a refined touch.\\nDeveloped design of enemies/character\\nThe enemies so far have been nicely designed and the characters get their goals and priorities about them which feels nice, some characters grow onto you while others seem to do things which you question.\\nPossible Pros/Cons\\nPros\\nAn anime with an unforgiving environment\\nParty isn't instant masters\\nCharacters learn skills logically\\nNicely animated (IMO)\\nVery noticable character development\\nCharacter's weaknesses and strengths are well portrayed.\\nAmazing soundtrack\\nCons\\nSome might not like the art style\\nThe characters might come across as annoying to some\\nCharacters won't fulfill all of the viewers expectations at every turn\\nDevelopment is slowly paced\\nCharacters don't start off with big goals\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c5001e0e1d03680cc4ac76e4c7c3b397'}>,\n",

Combined with the RPG approach of figuring things by yourselves unlike being given a target of reaching the top level of a certain floating fortress or defeating a demon king, this anime is going to deliver itself in a more of a slice-of-life type pacing.\\nSo what would the plot of a slice-of-life living in a fantasy world anime be like? You\\'ve guessed it! Most of it are character development, both from fighting monsters and the interactions between each party member.

In multiple episodes, they add a lenghty song while showing not much activities from any of the characters.\\nThose of you who have read the LN, you might go on a rage on why they omit a big event while deciding to show watercolor painting with music that does not do any justice to the LN.

The art itself isn\\'t super HD beautiful works, but rather they look like water-color hand painted backgrounds; it\\'s very refreshing. It\\'s like they used the really great concept art for the show, and just said, \"hey this is good enough just use this\", and it is!\\n-Sound 9/10 : Another high point for this show.

The action has rock, the fun even has some rap, and the beautiful and emotional moments have calm and soothing songs.\\n-Characters 8/10: The characters in this show are very easy to like or even fall in love with. The main party feels simple to relate to, you grow and progress with them.

The story is more one of survival than anything.\\nAlmost like a slice of life but with people being sucked into a fantasy world with no memory of where and when they came from. It has the perfect amount of love story in it.

Grimgar tries to copy Mushishi, Angel Beats, and other trapped and fight in some world anime like Sword Art Online, mix them together, and utterly fails. Here are the things.\\nBoring......the interactions between the characters are horribly boring and unnatural. No introductions, no explanations. And anime is trying to be all Mushishi, exploring and living the wonders of this fantasy world when there is nothing special worth living about this fantasy world, your usual rivers, nature scenery, towns, and their life is on the line? What kind\\nof mood setting is this?\\nCharacters act like scared idiots when they out to hunt and it's being scared to a stupid level. Again, your life is on the line? I cannot sympathize with it, if you're gonna be that scared don't hunt, and sell all the nice gears and weps you somehow have, better yet sell off the girls for money, why not? hahaha. They couldn't even 7 vs. 1 a single goblin that bothered nobody without looking pathetic. Then when they get injured, like it matters, they have that magic healing spell......oh goody!\\nTheir hunts ahead came with a certain tragic event that was bound to happen at their rate, but really just came with laughable cringey drama that sets them off to adapt into more drama idiots. The story tries to make us feel emotionally connected to the characters like Angel Beats, but I didn't feel a thing. The characters realize how much they need each other, stays boring and annoying with the added drama, and figures out how to slay some more goblins.\\nThen it's back to paragraph 2 and repeat.....Rinse and repeat!\\nUntil finally, they go and take on the wolf bosses. The action wasn't all that exciting and was underwhelming, but at least they break through and didn't break down even through trouble.

Where as Sword Art Online explained for its anime. Good for them they finally find home in Grimgar.....\\nI was disappointed by Grimgar, the quality of the anime, story, character was pretty bad and failed to improve much. Their insert songs were just bad too.

       "  <Document: {'content': '\"Ichigo Mahimaro Encore\" takes us back to the world of the five Ichigo girls!\\nStory: 8/10\\nAs with many \"slice of life\" anime titles, the story doesn’t really have any real place in the time line. It could happen pretty much at any time during the girls childhood. However, with this series it’s all about comedy and cuteness. So does it have both of them once again? You bet! From watching Miu have an \"after-life\" experience, to the girls trying to figure out whom of which can be considered best friends, to gags that seem to come out of nowhere. Each episode showcases a different style of\\nidea or situation for the girls. Just about all of the episodes revolve around Miu (who is the one responsible for 90% of the gags again), which may in turn disappoint fans of the other girls. Still, each of them is shown in good equality with her, and the gags and laughs that you have come to expect from the anime, are all present and accounted for. In fact I would go on record of saying that episode 2 of Encore, is by far one of the funniest I have seen for the entire anime. Now since none of the stories really ever have an overall goal in mind (this version being no exception), viewers who couldn’t stand the series for it’s cuteness factor or pointless story, should avoid this one as well. Since nothing new has been added to the series (other than a tweak in the art department), and sadly there are only 2 episodes with this version. Overall though, fans of the anime won\\'t be dissapointed! The OVA manages to capture the charm of the show to a \"T.\" So grab a nice bucket of popcorn, site back, relax and get ready for some good cute fun!\\nArt: 7/10\\nFor me this was one of the hardest things to get use to. For some odd reason \"DAUME\" decided to tweak the art style for the characters in this version, and now all the girls look slightly older and much more...round? It would almost appear that they have been packing away a dozen doughnuts everyday since we saw them last. Other than that however it all stays the same. Backgrounds remain pretty washed out, the color is still soft, and the character design remains cute and fluffy. If you can make it past the new looking character design, then the art style shouldn\\'t hinder your enjoyment.\\nSound 8/10\\nAs expected we get a new opening and ending theme, made solely for this OVA. Once again the opening is cute with a high beat party pitch with the actual voice cast singing. The ending is much more calmer sincere pitched. The series\\' strong point in the audio department has never really been with the actual music, as most of it can be considered nothing if not \"appropriate.\" Where the series shines in this department is with it\\'s voice cast. All the Japanese voice actors have returned to fill their roles to each character, and pull it off great! I especially enjoyed the part where Miu inmates the other girls, you can tell that Fumiko Orikasa (her voice actress) is a very talented individual, because she does a good job of actually sounding like them!\\nCharacters: 9/10\\nThe girls retain their cuteness, charm and innocent ways. From Nobue\\'s lazy carefree attitude, to Matsuri\\'s timid personality. It really feels like not a moment has past since we last left them. No new characters have been added, and the cast remains as small as it ever did, and thus only shows the actual five girls. Which might disappoint some viewers. It shouldn\\'t be much of a problem since this version is only 2 episodes long. The cast doesn\\'t really have a large amount of depth to them, but they do compliment each other very well! Bottomline, they remain the same characters you have grown to either love or hate. Fans of the series will no doubt be pleased though!\\nOverall: 8/10\\n\"Ichigo Mashimaro Encore\" remains true to the series! Art style aside, it\\'s the same kind of charm and comedy fans of the anime have grown to love over the years. If you didn\\'t care for the anime before, then this one won\\'t make you change your mind. If you\\'re a fan of the series, or just like a good amount of cuteness to go along with your viewings. Then I highly recommend this version.

It kinda melds together with the OVA and they came in the same DVD set that my sister bought for us to watch. The first episode had Miu taking a trip to the afterlife, which was in some ways hysterical, and in others pretty discomforting. Miu\\'s one-liners were hilarious (\"Taxi!!\"), but lifting up Ana\\'s skirt was NOT. It\\'s a common theme with the show, very funny and cute stuff with\\nreally disturbing lolicon crap added too. Just look the other way...these episodes felt more original and unique than the OVA did though.\\nArt was done differently, just didn\\'t look as sharp or well done as the original or OVA. Ranked it lower because of that.\\nVoice acting was fine, but the theme songs weren\\'t that great. Lower score because of that too.\\nCharacters were themselves and then some, really kept it true to the original series. On this part, they will not disappoint!!\\nIt was enjoyable, but you have to sit through the lolicon stuff that makes you really uncomfortable. It\\'s a shame too,the entire series would be so cute and still very funny without all of that crap.\\nStill a decent \"2nd season\" to the show and worth watching if you liked the first.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Hey, can I say something amazing right now?\\nThis anime is, that's what.\\nJoshikousei no Mudazukai was the one show above all which throughout the season I genuinely didn't understand why it didn't have a higher score on MAL. Me and many of my friends were in agreement that it's probably been the best comedy of the season, and it almost always manages to be entertaining.\\nBy design it's nothing out of the ordinary. Just another high school comedy starring a bunch of girls. However, what truly makes it shine is the character cast and the dynamic between them. Mudazukai is very self-aware and every girl in the\\nshow is primarily referred to by some stupid nickname that the main character Tanaka has thought up. Tanaka herself, more commonly known as Baka, is as her name suggests an absolute moron. I can't stress enough just how stupid she is, but her stone-faced and deadly serious way of approaching the most ridiculous ideas she thinks up and then promptly forcing them on her friends is probably the core of what makes the show so funny. It's like a domino effect where her antics spread to everyone around her almost as if infecting them with her stupidity which in turn causes them to bring out their own abundance of great comedic interaction. All the characters are basically forced to accept and embrace their own quirks as a result, which effectively turns their own tropes into their advantage instead.\\nIf you want to draw some parallels then Joshikousei no Mudazukai can be compared to the likes of Nichijou, Aho Girl or Asobi Asobase with similar kinds of over-the-top, meme-like and really stupid comedic scenarios, but thanks to the character cast it all works out really well. Obviously comedy is still very subjective so it's difficult to really critique it, but if you enjoyed any of those anime then I would definitely recommend checking this one out too.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '181743fb91380ad7439f3e9950d837d8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Sometimes I question myself why I continue to watch such a stupid ammount of anime each season. I know I like to keep up with the conversation, but I obsess over it and because of that I end up dropping half of the shows I initially started watching. But watching this anime reminded me of a second reason why I continue my watching: It is to find hidden gems. Last season Choukadou Girl ⅙ was my hidden gem and this season it is Joshikousei no Mudazukai. But while Choukadou Girl ⅙ was a short anime poking fun at the otaku culture, Joshikousei no Mudazukai is\\nanother beast. And I mean, ANOTHER beast. You know why?\\nJoshikousei no Mudazukai is my comedy of the year. And here is why.\\nWhen it comes to comedies the cast is very important. Konosuba, Nichijou, you can't have a good comedy without a good cast. And Joshikousei luckily has one. First we have the red girl (sorry I forgot all the names of the cast. give me a break there are like 10 shows I am watching right now and mal took no effort to fill in the characters section). The red girl is incredibly cynical around his group of friends, often making snarky comments around brown haired happy girl, but at home she is a big otaku who has a passion for manga drawing. Then we have the brown haired happy girl who is incredibly energetic but constantly gets herself into problems. And then we have the third main character. Get this: she is a black haired girl with a blank expression, is a genius and is incredible unpredictable, often doing outlandish things you wouldn't expect out of a school girl like her. Now where have I heard that before….\\nOkay I am not gonna hide the Obvious comparisons to Nichijou. The black haired girl is basically a copy of Mai, the unpredictable humor are the same with both, the wild type of characters are the same with both, but honestly Joshikousei is more similar to Asobi Asobase of last year with the more structured scenarios instead of the skit-based nature of Nichijou. That's why I have the perfect description of this anime:\\nJoshikousei no Mudazukai is as if Asobi Asobase had the characters of Nichijou.\\nAnd I think that combination works wonderfully. The character interactions are all either charming or hilarious, the surprising punchlines keep me off-guard, the pacing (the one similar to Asobi Asobase) is great… yeah this anime is absolutely amazing. I know this anime is not for everyone, but if you love either Asobi Asobase or Nichijou you will love this anime.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ba043b87db74c052f651b081615eb3b8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '\"Hey, can I say something amazing?\" - Baka\\n\"OH HOLY $H!T, why is this show SOOOO criminally underrated!?\" - The minority of people watching this (including yours truly)\\nThis show is comedy gold that we\\'ve been seeking since recent times, and as it goes for a stupidly, insanely great premise for a school comedy, something along the lines of last Summer\\'s Asobi Asobase, but fusing with the characters from Nichijou and Daily Lives Of High School Boys, girls\\' edition. At first, I thought it was like some mindless random high school JKs just lamenting their lives in school trying to make their own mark everywhere they go,\\nbeing friends and strangers, all within the space of their own perceptions that looked like a bad premise. But as we all know, it isn\\'t so as time progresses and seeing the character cast of their troupes and cliches that we have come to know and accept their randomness with the endless amount of gags that keeps us on our toes for both the expected and unexpected. That\\'s a punchline!\\nBeing a full-on comedic series, you would want the character cast to be as dynamic and unique as possible, as how we\\'ve seen with both said series before. And this series did illustrate each and every character to the fullest \"potential\". More than just being the group of generic \"meh\" girls with only their unique \"quirks\" to offer in the midst of jokes that hold up hits and misses at times, mangaka Bino ACTUALLY referenced the names of the character casts to the puns and illusions of their own personalities. And with that being said, let\\'s throw the story out completely and bring on the characters!\\nThe trio of same-class classmates: Tanaka \"Baka\" Nozomu, Akane \"Wota\" Kikuchi and Shiori \"Robo\" Saginomiya.\\nAt first glance, these 3 girls look like your average school clique of friends. HOWEVER, look past the first impressions and you\\'d have a group of girls who does the EXACT same thing over and over again, so much so that it transforms the initial annoyance to a gem of classic comedy that\\'s tried-and-truely done impressively well.\\nBaka is the constant being of an incredibly stupid and senseless girl, so much so that nobody wants to retaliate her annoying criticisms about everything that is randomized, plus her opening catchphrase.\\nWota, on the other hand, is aspiring to be a BL mangaka due in part of her being a fan of BL. Moreover, her heart cries out for Vocaloid Teishotoku P as both a fan and crush...but there\\'s a plot twist to it (that we\\'ll see later)!\\nRobo is the type of girl who is emotionless at everything, from her figure of speech to her interest being experiments on biological stuff, so much so that Tanaka calls her \"Robo\" due to her no-note talking, as if to mimic a robot.\\nThe \"Filler\" classmayes: Saku \"Loli\" Momoi, Yamamoto \"Yamai\" Minami, Ninomae \"Majime\" Kanade, Kujou \"Majo\" Hisui and Lily Someya.\\nDue to her physique and appearance being one very similar to an (loli) elemntary school kid, don\\'t ever look down upon this childhood innocence of a high school girl, because she wears kindness over her life due to her upbringing with her granny in Japan while parents are away (well duh, of course). Plus, being tormented by everyone with \"adult\" misunderstandings meant that Loli could not grasp situations well that pertains to the adult mindset. we must protecc Loli!\\nYamamoto is your typical average chuunibyou that expunges the daily life with her fix of chuunibyou stuff, so much so that their homeroom teacher is SO irritated by it, he counsels her to insanity.\\nMajime is the sort of character where I would call the \"aloof\" human, due to her tomboyish character notes while not being a social butterfly. And it is this case where she stalks Robo to no end, admiring her smart intelligence all her life.\\nMajo is the group\\'s occult lead, so much so that nobody would want to go near her as she can chant spells that affect the mundaneness that is the human life.\\nPlus, with Lily Someya transferring into the school (and getting acquainted with Tanaka and Co.), she is (naturally) the school\\'s bishoujo, but her anchor lies in her phobia of men (which Tanaka flinches everytime), and with her character design being a parody of lesbian characters, it\\'s not hard to see striking similarities.\\nLast but not least, the homeroom teacher Masataka \"Waseda\" Sawatari. Despite his quirky appearance, he holds 2 positions: One, to disperse Yamamoto\\'s chuunibyou habits, and two, act as Wota\\'s secret musical artist admirer. Remember what I said about Teishotoku P? If you\\'re wondering who he is, Waseda IS THE ONE. WOW, WHAT A PLOT TWIST!\\nAll the characters here, be it working for or against one another, has always had that magical mystery of clicking together for some insane reason or whatnot, it will always stand to be as the highlight of the series by a long shot due to how much the character interactions become the main crux that plays to release all that pent-up frustration of wasting lives away like it\\'s nothing. Plus, a shout-out to the 9 student-ladies crew of VAs who worked tirelessly on this show to give us an overwhelming positive experience!\\nIf there is one person to thank for this marvelous setpiece, it is chief director Takeo Takahashi, who has directed the infamous Aki Sora, the incredible Spice and Wolf, the divisive Yosuga no Sora, and now with studio Passione as studio director. It\\'s by far none his best recent directorial work to date. As with studio Passione doing the art and animation, it\\'s pretty average to say the least, or at least on what the studio has been doing for the last 2 years of decent levelling. Particularly, nothing really stands out other than insane scenarios that had me wailing so hard I got bored and yawned at times.\\nHOWEVER...*OP plays*\\n\"YO...Mic Check...JK! Wa! Moon! Dass! Cry! Everyday!\"\\nWhile the OST too is very lacking in expressions, at least it somewhat redeems it based on the OP and ED alone. I hate to say it, but while the ED was fine by any usual standards, the OP...like WHAT THE HELL! It went from being SOOOO \"meh\" to singing \"Uuu~~~~ Wa! Moon! Dass! Cry! Everyday!\" every episode, at least it is for me! Now THIS is an OP I can share around with friends and marvel at the visuals and technicals about it, plus the crazy (in)sanity at how this simple song was so damn catchy and knows its shtick very well, it may just be one of (if not) the best and unique OPs of the season due to the amount of creativity that is put forth onto it. And now that song is stuck in my head, singing \"Wa! Moon! Dass! Cry! Everyday!\"...you know it when the GOAT music director Jin Aketagawa is at the helm.\\nWhile I\\'d like to re-watch this sometime in the future, the only gripe I had with this show is that more often than not, as stupid as they seem and sound, the jokes either don\\'t land or have less of an eventful impact, so much that it detracts any fun had with this show. With that being said, that is just my nitpick, but if you like full-on comedy that is satisfying at every nook and cranny, this is the show for you.\\nIf only Nichijou and Daily Lives of High School Boys had birthed a child, Joshikousei no Mudazukai is a DAMN GOOD (no pun intended) waste of time, wasting our days as high school JKs recreate those moments for the students in us.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '740dd78c0f8ea386546ac45cbcfac134'}>,\n",

Tons of Sol anime already exists so you need to be as creative as possible\\nto actually survive in this genre, that in itself is the reason it is the most explored genre in anime because you either push yourself to create an extremely good show or you fail from the start.\\nThankfully, all that helps produce better anime and as a Sol fan, this helps me find new great stuff to watch like this one for example.\\nJoshikause no Mudazukai is a great anime for lots of reasons but I personally think the balance it found is its greatest charm, the anime was able to create a great atmosphere with 3 main characters without ever seeing one of them being pushed out like it happened in Daily lives of highschool boys. It was able to create around them lots of interesting and funny ideas while still exploring different stories with the other side characters. It never gets boring and that is why I found it to be so entertaining.\\nThe characters are great as well, each one has her hown unique characteristics and tho the character I dislike the most out of them all is Lily, she isn\\'t made to be a horny lesbian and that\\'s it like lots of characters in other Sol anime, she actually has a personality and for a character I think is the worst one in the show I would give her an 7/10. When your most hated character gets a 7/10, it shows how good they are.\\nThe comedy was great, it was never repetitive and there were different types of jokes throughout the whole anime, I enjoyed myself and laughed a lot in most of the episodes.\\nThe art, animation were amazing, The OSTs, Op, Ed were amazing and the voice acting was perfect. Also Waseda best girl 10/10.\\nThe only downfall for me was episode 9, The whole episode was Lily feeling up Majime because Lily knows that Majime doesn\\'t know she is a lesbian so she won\\'t suspect anything. That was pretty much the whole episode, it was so bad tbh and the reason that made me dislike Lily the most.\\nOverall I would give the anime a 9/10, would have given it a 10/10 specially after how great the last 2 episodes were but episode 9 is the reason I didn\\'t tbh.\\nWould recommend it to anyone wanting to have a fun time and laugh a lot.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9d19ab5500fc8f9faa506e02c69e00dc'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '(This is my first review ever sorry if its bad)\\nThis anime flew completely under the radar of this seasons shows. Granted, so do a lot of other great shows but this particular one kind of made me mad at the majority of people who look for the first show in the shounen genre, or the first show to come up as the most popular by majority. I wish people would pay more attention to great and humorous shows like these.\\nOur three main characters are, Nozomu \"Baka\" Tanaka, Akane \"Wota\" Kikuchi, and Shiori \"Robo\" Saginomiya.\\nWhat I noticed right off the bat is that the characters\\nare basically more or less are exactly the same characters as Yuuko, Mio, and Mai from Nichijou. A quick run down of the characters:\\nNozomu, aka \"Baka\", gained this nickname for giving all her friends equally stupid names, hence, \"Baka\". She constantly likes to ask dumb questions (without knowing it), never does her homework, and amuses her friend(s), although its mostly Robo/Shiori.\\nAkane, aka \"Wota\" gained this nickname for being an Otaku, in her spare time she likes to draw BL/manga, kind of secretive about it, and is pretty much the only normal person in this series.\\nAnd then we have Shiori, aka \"Robo\", because she hardly expresses any emotions at all, She is very smart, somewhat strange, and gets a kick out of talking to Nozomu/Baka.\\nAs I mentioned before, the characters show almost identical characteristics to those of our MCs in Nichijou. (Yuuko=Nozomu \"Baka\", Mio=Akane \"Wota\", and Mai=Shiori \"Robo\".)\\nAnd do I have a problem with this? Nope. The show has many more characters along side our MCs and shares a very similar feel to Asobi Asobase, which personally I think is a good thing. Humor is Humor and I really cant get enough of it. This show has its fair share of snide remarks, some form of meta jokes, awesome character interaction, and quite a lot more but my break is almost over and I don\\'t have enough time for that. I really do get the feeling that we are watching the characters in their day to day life, instead of the characters living for the camera, which makes it all the more hilarious, considering basically no one is going to act like that in real life. Although the art is pretty, well, meh, without any other way to put it, its still averageish and I can let it slide.\\nSo overall, I recommend this show along side any other golden comedy shows you can get your hands on, but none will be exactly the same as the other, which is good when it comes to comedy because originality is much needed so we can laugh at snide remarks all over again. We need much more shows like these, but please, when you have some time on your hands, go take a look at this show.

That itself is a feat to\\nwithhold considering that moe culture is a staple on every show with high school girls on it which gives this show an edge.\\nArt - 9\\nI\\'m glad they made the art as close to the source material as possible.\\nSound - 9\\nOne of the best OP I\\'ve heard of so far. I really love the trio\\'s voice spouting random stuffs at different pitch.\\nCharacters - 9\\nThe trio has a very good balance. The idiotic MC that is basically chaos itself laying waste to the other girls\\' lives, the awkward otaku who tries her best to tolerate said MC, and the cool beauty with lots of weird hobbies. Then there\\'s these other characters such as the delusional girl which I think has the funniest scenes and the college girl-loving teacher who tries his best to maintain order in the class despite the amount of weirdos he has to deal with.\\nEnjoyment - 10\\nI\\'ll give this part a perfect score after watching episode 5. The interaction between the teacher and the delusional girl is just hilarious.\\nOverall - 9\\nAll in all it\\'s a very nice, relaxing show. A breath of fresh air from all fantasies (I\\'m looking at the Isekai \"genre\") and drama recently. And a someone who started reading the source material (manga) before the adaptation, I sure am looking forward for more episodes because I am waiting for some other scenes and I know that it\\'ll just keep getting better.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3efd6d3087e2bad2bbdf7d1578a6543c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I think I'm wasting time here as most people actually enjoy this kind of anime, but I'd like to point out at least one thing, even if by stating my own opinion I will be most likely ignored.\\nThis anime thrives by 'not being normal'. And that's it. The plot, the characters, the unfolding events, everything is mostly connected to being the opposite to normal. Stupidity brought to the banana girl level, useless infatuation alongside procrastination and a passive genius that is supposed to be a comic relief through absurdity and irony.\\nI repeat, this is my own opinion, but this anime is TRASH.\\nIf you started anime and went chronologically you can remember many example of anime that tried to use the abnormal factor as the theme. But most of them had some advantages. This one does not have such a thing. You can't think to enjoy this anime. You just need to accept the absurdity and laugh. Think, you who watched a lot of anime, how many times did it happen that in a rock,paper,scissor to make something funny the creator added a new move? Or how many times did it use a loli that hates being made fun of? Or how many times ... did you get a shitload of cliches?\\nLastly, this is a waste of time, I'm dropping it. I just wanted to write my opinion even if its a waste of time as I can't stand seeing this shit being ignored as a problem when the 'isekai' genre is considered a plague. They are both in the same category, a freaking curse.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '241722dc08be368eae2782ea26241d69'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"This show is a hilarious look at the lives of highschool girls, with an interesting cast and naturally-flowing humor.\\nThe strong point of the show is definitely its characters. First there’s Baka, the idiot of the group who’s always going on random ramblings thinking she’s being insightful. If there’s a heartfelt moment, you can count on Baka to ruin it by saying something inappropriate - she’s not being malicious though, she’s just chaotically stupid. This also makes her the butt-end of the others’ insults, but naturally she’s too stupid to realize she’s being insulted.\\nThen there’s Wota, arguably the most normal girl in the main trio\\nwho’s actually a major otaku. She has a thing for boys-love and the slightest hint of men interacting will make her totally lose it. Finally there’s Robo, the intelligent but expressionless member of the group who gives deadpan retorts. She knows how to manage the others' antics, and actually cares a lot for her friends.\\nWhat’s great though is that all the side characters are interesting and given depth. We have Loli, a tiny girl who tries to act mature, only to immediately talk about Santa and ask how babies are made. There’s also Lily, a beautiful lesbian who is allergic to men (and allergic to Baka, much to Baka’s offence), and Majo, an occult fanatic with a twin sister who’s always trying to help her make friends (including baiting her with the ghost of Michael Jackson). The list goes on, but the great thing is that despite the large cast, every character is likable.\\nThe humor mostly comes from character interactions, as their unique personalities play-off each other flawlessly and they all react differently to situations. One of my favorite skits is when Lily mentions the “Five ‘S’s of attracting boys”, to which all the other girls in class come up with completely different sets of “Five ‘S’s” based on their absurd quirks. Many of the jokes are also built up over several episodes, so you need to stick around for this one.\\nThis show is really self-aware and often makes fun of anime cliches. There’s a part where the trio want to go to a beach/hot spring, but they can’t find a rich girl in class whose family owns a villa, so they try going to the shopping district to win the raffle instead. Baka’s fantasies about finding romance also end up being hilarious parodies of girls manga – she always wins over men by acting weird to make them think she’s “an interesting woman” (apparently she has enough self-awareness to know she can’t get guys off of her looks or talents).\\nThere are also little things that make this show that much better. Side characters usually do funny things in the background which really shows attention to detail. Another example is when Baka runs off to be a pig farmer and names her pigs after her former classmates. I burst out laughing when I realized the pig squeals were voiced by the same voice actors as the classmates with the same names. There was also an episode where I noticed Baka’s breasts seemed to be animated bigger, and at the end of the episode it was revealed to be Baka telling the story lol.\\nWasteful Days was just an all-round enjoyable experience, and if you enjoy shows of highschoolers doing wacky things like Nichijou, Daily Lives of Highschool Boys, Chio’s School Road and Asobi Asobase, then you should give this one a watch.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '218eb0c107d32a165e8b3ffdaa24c21c'}>,\n",

The same warning goes to you too, Asobi Asobase.\\nAlready being the finest --and sneakiest-- anime of the season, Joshikousei no Mudazukai takes no prisoners starting from its bop-pop OP and the spot-on depiction of the first days of school-- when innocent daydreams get crushed easily by a bitter-and-a-bit-perverted homeroom teacher. It is refreshing to see three heroines who are not\\nimmediately close friends from the get-go-- therefore saving up a promising investment for character development on future episodes. Each episode serves as a centerpiece for different characters with our main heroine, fondly nicknamed \\'Baka\\', as the glue that holds everything together. Every single character is adorably inexplicable and that\\'s where the gold mine is. While Daily Lives of High School Boys and Asobi Asobase rely more on their comedic antics, Joshikousei no Mudazukai relies more on the weirdness of each character and the chemistry that unfolds.\\nThe character highlights (so far) are definitely Yamai, who is probably the first-ever female depiction of Eight Grade Syndrome in anime, and Wota, who constantly fails to hide her hunger for all things BL. Nonetheless, it is still Baka who becomes the true gem of the story. Is 16\\'15\" to 20\\'25\\'\\' of Episode 1 officially the funniest four minutes (and ten seconds) of 2019 in anime? Well, we need to wait until December to find out but nonetheless, that would be the candidate to beat for sure.\\nTentative conclusion?

The other girls in the class are all equally as dull, but since they are given less screen time overall, it\\'s much less noticeable. The teacher is the only character consistently fun to watch.\\nThere is very little effort put in to exploring the characters or developing them. In fact, the only character that got any sort of meaningful development was Wota, and that episode was the best of the show.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'A surprisingly fun to watch anime\\nFilling in part the emptiness that left Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, Joshikousei no Mudazukai (Wasteful Days of High School Girl) comes to present a slice of life comedy about a group of peculiar friends and how they spend their daily lives doing ridiculous stuff.\\nOne day, out of boredom, Tanaka decided to give her classmates a nickname based on their peculiarities. Her friend Sakuchi became \"Ota\" given her otaku interests, and her other friend Saginomiya became \"Robo” due to her inexpressive personality. In retaliation, her friends decided to nickname her \"Baka\" for her notorious idiocy. From this event will begin this\\nridiculous story of three friends and their classmates who claim (but do not prove) to live up to the maturity of youth.\\nBeing one of those titles that I really did not expect or know anything before its premiere, Joshikousei no Mudazukai has ended up being, at least for me, one of the surprises of the past summer season, a work that from the outside would seem to be just another anime of cute girls doing cute things, but that already entering into it, proves to be a really competent comedy, being within this genre one of the most entertaining works with which I have had the opportunity to run into during the year of its broadcast.\\nThe anime is simply a school comedy, which leads us to witness the daily life of a picturesque and disparate group of young students from a high school for girls only. The work then has as its main protagonists a triad of friends conformed by Tanaka, an absolute idiot from head to toes full of energy that wants a boyfriend without trying anything to get it, Kikuchi, a future mangaka and fanatic of the yaoi, and Saginomiya, an inexpressive and intelligent young woman with great interest in the world of microorganisms.\\nThe anime then goes on how the relationship between these three friends and the conversations and situations unfolds, in many irrelevant and absurd cases that they end up constantly having, as well as their interactions with their teacher, a declared fan of university girls, and their others classmates, among which we find an innocent and short loli tsundere, a blonde with a serious case of chuunibyou, a mature and smart tomboy girl list somewhat obsessed with Robo, a beautiful student transferred with lesbian tendencies, and an adorable and shy fan of occultism and dark things, which together will give way to diverse and entertaining situations and interactions that will keep more than one entertained.\\nAlthough I could not catalog the series in any way as an original work, since premises and characters of this style can be found in many other titles of the same tonic, that does not take away from the anime that it is a quite entertaining series and fun to follow, whose chemistry and interactions between its characters is its greatest strength, and which is seen inmediatly, being a very light title whose chapters passes quick before you know it.\\nVisually speaking the series is competent but little else, the anime is not that it looks bad but it does not impress in any way, delivering a correct animation, attractive but not very striking character designs, and a background work that goes quite unnoticed.\\nLikewise, its soundtrack is not that it attracts a lot of attention, passing under the radar and barely noticing that it is there, but I must comment that its opening song entitled, “Wa! Moon! Dass! Cry!” Turns out to be a song quite lively and visually appealing, in addition to being a total nonsense that has no meaningful lyrics, meanwhile the ending theme entitled \"Seishun no Reverb\", although much less striking is also quite pleasant to the ear.\\nA work not too prominent and one could say that even inconsequential, but which definitely turns out to be an entertaining anime, which is perfect to spend a pleasant time without throwing a lot of brain. It is not the best school comedy out there, and it is one of those works that you will most likely forget within a few weeks or days of seeing it, but it is a fun title worth checking out, especially if you like seeing high school girls doing nonsense.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'If I could rename this show, it would be \"Joshikousei no Nichijou\".\\nThese aren\\'t your average everyday memes, these are ADVANCED memes. I wouldn\\'t expect the average anime otaku to understand Joshikousei no Mudazukai. You would have to have very high IQ to understand it. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of DAIBUTSU or WASEDA most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\\'s head. There\\'s also Tanaka\\'s AHO outlook, which is deftly woven into her charaterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from OMOSHIREONNA, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths\\nof these jokes, to realise that they\\'re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Joshimuda truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\\'t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Tanaka\\'s existential nickname \"BAKA\" which in itself is a cryptic reference to an Ancient Chinese Proverb of calling a deer the same as a horse. I\\'m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as ビーノ\\'s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. I pity them. 😂\\nIn all seriousness though, one of the best comedies I\\'ve seen in a long time. Joshimuda does everything it can to destroy the image of japanese highschool girls being shy, delicate flowers. If you\\'re ever tired of watching girls acting girly, this is probably the show for you. In this show you can find not just one character, but an entire cast of the weirdest most unusual cases of joshikousei in their natural habitat. Often times, observing natural joshikousei is a very rare chance, because they\\'re quick to hide themselves behind a facade of cute phrases or dazzling cosmetics, distracting the male predator in order to buy time to escape into their safe space. Here, we have rare footage of them acting as naturally as any human being would: quirky, full of faults and, with lack of a better term, simply human. I\\'d be lying if I said I never liked any pandering moe shows. But in all fairness, joshimuda\\'s portrayal of joshikousei is probably the most realistic in a weird way, and I think that\\'s what makes it funny.\\nStory - 7\\nThe series is quite episodic, usually focusing on a character at a time or playing out a skit involving a few characters. Similar to Nichijou or Danshikoukousei no Nichijou, all three shows follow this skit-like pattern (and coincidentally have 3 main characters). The main character \"BAKA\" is usually involved, but the show focuses on the side characters quite a lot as well.\\nArt - 7\\nNo, it doesn\\'t have gorgeous backdrops, nor does it have breathtaking animation. But I think the art of the show perfectly fits the theme of the show. It\\'s simple and that\\'s all it needs since the focus is not really the art, it\\'s the comedy.\\nSound - 6\\nDon\\'t expect any catchy tunes either. Although the opening is really good, the show itself doesn\\'t have much to go for in terms of soundtrack. There was a special song episode but that\\'s pretty much it. However what it lacks in BGM it makes up for in dialogue and voice acting. Japanese voice acting has always been known for its high quality and this is no exception.\\nCharacter - 10\\nEach character basically represents a different stereotype of a japanese highschooler. And you may think: Can people like this actually exist? And you might be surprised to find out that they\\'re really not that uncommon. In the prodigality of highschool youth, people can act in the most unusual ways. I\\'m sure everyone has acted strangely in one way or another during their youth. Adoloscence is one of life\\'s greatest mysteries and watching people act as strangely as they do is what I think makes these characters very interesting and fun to watch.\\nEnjoyment - 10\\nI found it funny, and does a comedy really need to be anything more? If it can make you laugh, smile or maybe even just a smirk, then I say it\\'s a good comedy.\\nOverall - 8\\nAll in all, a series I would totally recommend 100% for any slice-of-life aficionado. A bit unfortunate that not many people are picking it up but in my list, it\\'s up there as one of the best SOL/comedy shows of all time.\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Joshimuda tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\\'s for the ladies\\' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\\'re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Okay...the show isn\\'t bad per say, but it\\'s also something that I\\'m not largely fond for. There is no big story, of course at it just revolves around the titular girls\\' every day high school lives so nothing overall amazing. The show also suffers from repetition. Each episode goes like this: Tanaka tells her friends that she was going to tell them something amazing much to their annoyance; the \"amazing fact\" is wholly nonsensical; Tanaka does something stupid often at the expense of other characters...rinse and repeat. But I would give that a pass because some of the characters are enjoyable. Scratch that: some are.\\nThe animation is average but unimpressive, befitting the series. Voice work is again decent in some areas. My only issue is that the subtitles would often then to go through to quickly for me to read, but that\\'s more of a minor gripe. The opening is very catchy, I\\'ll give it that.\\nAs for characters, it\\'s a mixed bag. Starting with Tanaka. Tanaka is an idiot who does idiotic things and whose seeming only reason to exist is to be an utter nuisance to the other characters. And that is what she is. Tanaka is probably the worst character I have ever had the misfortune of being introduced to. Her voice is annoying; she acts like a total douchebag for no other reason than for amusement; and she never changes for the better. While annoying characters can be funny, here, there is nothing endearing about Tanaka. She is that bad of a character. I don\\'t even begin to fathom why Ota and Robo have anything to do with her. Worse, I feel that one of the reasons as to why this show often varies is because it\\'s being weighed down by Tanaka\\'s presence. There are such things as lovable idiots, but this is not one of them.\\nOta is slightly better. She is a level-headed otaku who tries to also be a manga author, and she also is deeply into BL. But that\\'s mostly it. Robo funnily enough is probably one of my favorites of the show thus far but I can\\'t really say why. Maybe it\\'s her stoicness; or that she is some kind of mad scientist who\\'s head is perpetually in the clouds. Or how she tends to be the deadpan snarker of the trio. Whatever the case, she is the best out of them both. As the series continued onward, you get introduced to more characters like Saku \"Loli\" Monoi who is unfortunately nicknamed that because she looks like a primary school student. Worse, she acts the part as the innocent child unintentionally such as still believing in Santa Claus or that babies were born when the parents to be write to the country\\'s court to grant them one. She also lives with her grandmother of her own volition. It\\'s...really touching. Hits really close to home for me.\\nOr there\\'s Minami \"Yamai\" Yamamoto, the resident chunnbiyou with delusions of grandeur and royally sucks at her academics. She is also pretty hilarious with how she uses this level of escapism to explain her poor performances in her grades and classwork. Kanade Ninomae is the boyish girl who finds herself unwittingly popular with the ladies and possesses a deep admiration for Robo. Lily Someya is the foreign exchange student and token lesbian of the setting who breaks out in allergic welts whenever she\\'s around men, but somehow, Tanaka has the same effect on her. But my other favorite character of the series has to be Masataka Sawatari, the teacher of the trio of misfits. His funniest moment is when he introduces himself to his students and then bluntly explains that he was into college girls and then goes on a tirade about Japan\\'s legal system. But I swear that I give this guy the upmost of respect. I mean, having to deal with bad students like Tanaka or Minami or all of the shenanigans that happen on a daily basis, and somehow not break down mentally...that takes some balls of steel.\\nSo, with that being said, my final thoughts on the show? The show is not perfect as it has many problems that I feel keep it from being largely enjoyable such as with Tanaka herself, or how the comedy doesn\\'t always hit. The show runs on a formula where you know that if you have X then Y must come afterwards. It can sometimes feel like an obnoxious watch, which is why I can\\'t really recommend it. But the show did remind me of a few school animes like Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, among others, so if you like those slice of life shows, then by all means,', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '609c949271c379259db0673723c4ffa1'}>,\n",

On a whim after listening to the immensely catchy OP, I decided to pick this up. And by doing so I narrowly avoided missing one of the best comedies of the year.\\nFrom the moment I saw that the OP credits were diegetic I knew I was in for something special. Indeed, everything from the direction, editing, comedic timing, jokes, everything was somehow executed to a mirror polish. Having each episode rotate\\nthe spotlight between the various characters also did wonders in letting each and every character shine, not just by themselves, but with other characters, creating several character dynamics and chemistry that very few other comedies can pull off. There is a good balance of screentime and prominence for the main trio and the side characters, lending the show a greater sense of scale and truly makes the world feel alive without being bloated by one-note one-scene characters. The show is also extremely consistent in terms of quality, a rarity considering most comedies tend to dip in quality after the first few episodes once familiar territory sets in. And the fact that it managed to be surprisingly heartwarming near the tail end of the series is a testament to good writing and directing.\\nI usually don't single this out, but the voice acting is absolutely superb in this. Everyone delivers a stellar performance that really sells the character they are portraying. Baka and Wota are absolutely the highlights of the series, with Baka's obnoxious idiot tomboy voice and Wota's dipping in and out of her tomboy voice and her girlier voice really demonstrating the vocal range of their seiyuu. It truly is spectacular just having a scene with either of these two in.\\nI missed this show because a few other shows with a similar style and setting (JKs) were airing and my mind assumed they were all similar. Don't do that. Go and watch this gem of a show. The humor is wacky yet grounded without being too over-the-top and the voice acting truly elevates this beyond its source material.

This was another anime that surprised me this Summer season. I added it to my Plan to Watch rather late, maybe a week before the first episodes of Summer started, and I\\'m super glad I did. This anime, had me laughing out loud an awful lot, and it\\'s always a nice change of pace, to have something just goofy every once in a while.\\nStory: Well, this is a slice of life, following a classroom of an all girls school, when our main hero, Tanaka, decides that\\neveryone needs a nickname in the class. Wota, Robo, Baka, Loli, Yamai, Majime, Majo, and even their professor, \"Waseda\". The story more or less, doesn\\'t carry over between episodes, and generally is a different adventure for the group with each episode, not that it takes away from how damn funny it is.\\nArt: The art is okay, nothing too crazy, the characters have their own unique personality, even if they aren\\'t overly detailed, or crazy looking. Same goes for the animation. It\\'s there, it gets the job done, but nothing too outlandish there.\\nSound: Uuuuwa! Moon! Das! Cry! I love the OP for this. I love how the characters of the classroom are the ones singing, and any time they provided english subtitles for the OP, I found myself musing over how ridiculous they were. That aside. The voice acting was solid. Robo was emotionless, Baka sounded look a goofball and a moron, Loli sounded like a child, and Wota, sounded normal- with a hint of boylove addiction.\\nCharacters: This was the strongest point of the anime for me. I loved each and every character. They steadily introduced new ones throughout the anime, each with their own unique personalities. Whether it was Lily, who was allergic to boys (and Tanaka), or Majo and her witchcraft, there was always a quirk. Not to mention Yamamoto, who, for a lack of better terms, is the princess of the dragon clan, or somethin like that.\\nEnjoyment: This was a refreshing anime. I enjoyed it thoroughly, for multiple reasons. My Fridays this season were loaded with big-name super serious animes, and it was always nice to end it off, with something light hearted like this, where I could just laugh, and smile.\\nOverall: 8/10. Was struggling to decide between 7 or 8, because of the fact that it does indeed lack seriousness, but, I came back to thinking about how much I actually enjoyed it, and looked forward to it, and that gave it the bump to an 8 for me.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '26d56deb86586962190f0e05ceb40859'}>,\n",

I am really going to miss these girls if they don\\'t come out with a season 2.\\nIf you enjoyed anime like Nichijou, Setokai Yakuindomo or Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, you more than likely will really enjoy this anime.  As the title suggests, it\\njust follows the random happenings of high school girls.  The trio of stars here are the aspiring BL Mangaka, Wota (Akane), The stoic and almost android like Robo (Shiori), and the mentally retarded goofball, Tanaka (Baka). These three have some of the best comedic chemistry I\\'ve seen together as MC\\'s in a while.  But, far and away, the best character was Baka (Tanaka).  She was just stone cold hilarious.  She\\'s the funniest idiot I\\'ve seen since Yoshiko Hanabatake from Aho-Girl.  (Another anime you should check out. Criminally underrated for how funny it is.).\\nSurrounding them are your usual cast of weirdos.  The Tomboy (Kanade), the Occult Hikki (Hisui), The Grade-Schooler (Saku), The Chuunibyou (Yamamoto), The beautiful foreign transfer student, (Lily) and the teacher that tries to keep them all under control. (Masataka).  Of this cast of supporting characters, Lily and Yamamoto stand out the most.  They were the funniest characters behind Baka.  (If you don\\'t watch this anime for anything else, watch it for the moment when Lily meets Kanade\\'s mom. I laughed for 5 minutes straight.) But the entire cast is solid. They\\'re all funny and likable. I particularly loved Yamamoto\\'s interactions with Masataka.\\nThe anime is a sketch comedy format, that just follows them from gag to gag, doing random things that high school girls do. Hanging out, shopping, going to the movies, studying, etc... And you would think that sounds boring, but it is most certainly not.  The level of comedic dialogue is top notch, and keeps everything extremely entertaining, because very few of the jokes do you see coming.  The writing is fantastic in that while using a lot of cliched character archetypes, they took great care not to rehash all of the same jokes you find in other anime of its ilk. (There are a few, but not many. You don\\'t find yourself watching a carbon copy of Zetsubou Sayonara Sensei or Haganai, even though a lot of the same character types are used there.).\\nSharp writing, great cast chemistry, fantastic comedic timing, and absolutely no poorly executed melodrama to drag it down at the end, makes this a wonderful anime to check out.

OP and ED are also enjoyable, and I found Teishoku-P to be pretty good, it was probably the least expected place I thought Volcaloid would be played, honestly.\\nI\\'d say that the story arcs and dialogue are well constructed, and carry the anime to great heights. None\\nof them are particularly bad, and the interactions are quite well made and pique your interest, even though the situations are typical slice of life.\\nThat being said, the reason why this is an 8, and not, lets say, a 9 out of 10 is because of the characters. The main cast is amazing, but some of the side cast and characters are really gimmicky and one dimensional. Robo, Baka, Ninomae, Wota, Yamai, and Waseda are fun characters to watch in action. While you wouldn\\'t call them extremely unique, they fit in their niches and aren\\'t characters you can predict to what they would say, and they can fit in a lot of different dialogues, environments, and interactions with other characters. Then you have Saku, Lily, and Majo, on the other hand, are pretty much one-liner characters. They\\'re pretty predictable, it even shows with how they interact with in terms of the rest of the cast. They are restricted to talking to a few select people, and how they even became on talking terms is also not exactly established either. It\\'s a hit or miss when those characters are part of the focal point in the \"skits,\" stories, whatever you want to call them. On the other hand, what I would consider the \"good\" cast usually won\\'t disappoint.\\nI think it is a little nitpicky, because I still enjoy more than half the cast, but I just wish that there were less archetypal characters. Yamai is enjoyable because of the way the author presents herself in situations, but she too, is quite a trope in these types of shows. I wished that the cast was smaller, and focused on the main cast. I mean, Asobi Asobase had only 3 main cast and few side characters, yet it managed to pull it off brilliantly. While I wouldn\\'t just want 3 characters in Joshikousei, I would want a more concentrated focus.\\nOverall, a great show for comedy and laughs.

Better than Yuyushiki, and slightly weaker than Azumanga.\\nLong story short rather than being a direct adaptation/transfer of manga material into anime, it is sorta of re-imagining and re-telling of the source material. They didn't transfer every story, only some, picking the better ones, and they tried to improve upon source materials. The characters are the same, some stories repeat, manga has more, but anime has upper hand in many moments. It is a good work and this is\\nhow those things should be done.\\nStory: 7/10.\\nRetelling of the source material, very well done. They picked best stories, tried to build upon the manga foundation and improve and largely succeeded. There's one rock paper scissor joke that fell flat in the anime but was hilarious in source material, but aside from that the story is enjoyable and improves upon manga in many aspects. Transition is very well handled.\\nArt: 6/10.\\nThe original manga has somewhat simplistic, but unique look that is somewhat flat. The artists did a great job transferring it into the anime, keeping characters simple. They look more 3-dimensional now too, but original quality remains, in a sense it is somewhat similar to mob psycho 100, even though art quality in mudazukai is better than in mob psycho.\\nHowever, the animation is really good. There movements, although they don't happen that often (as it is slice of life) are fluid, backgrounds are detailed, there aren't cost-cutting attempts to turn people into chibi and the like. Well done.\\nSound: 7/10.\\nStellar work by voice actresses, and amazing intro.\\nCharacter: 6/10.\\nThe original manga characters were mostly archetypes, the anime improves on them and makes them more life-like and human-like. However, this is still no seinen and the characters while having (somewhat?) complex motivations and personalities are not like real people. They're likable, sympathetic, but you remember at all times that this is still a comedy.\\nThe strongest characters in the series are a bit unexpected - they're Waseda and Yamai, followed by Baka. I do wish they could spend more time showing/introducing the characters, as manga spent more time on them. However result is still quite good.\\nEnjoyment: 7/10.\\nLiked it.\\nOVerall: 7/10.\\nIf you watched Azumanga and like comedies about school girls you should definitely check this one out.

I went through 9 episodes and had never laughed at any of it. And the rest of the episode is for sure chaotic but still unfunny. The comedy of this anime is hopeless. The jokes are not slapstick, well done. But even so, they try to be intelligent with their jokes in the most normal and predictable way which makes it unfunny.

I\\'ve seen a lot of Chuunibs in anime and none of them disappointed me. The Chuunib in this anime is very weak. And I didn\\'t mean physically weak.

She\\'s just there wearing bandages, sitting on trees, telling everyone that she\\'s a dragon knight from another world etc. She\\'s just there to exist.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I’ve always enjoyed watching cute girls doing cute things (looking at you, Houkago Tea Time), but derpy girls doing derpy things have stolen a piece of my heart. From the main trio to the supporting cast and all the social webs spun in between, Joshikousei no Mudazukai is something special.\\nIndeed, the girls of class 1-2 have a surprising amount of depth to their characters. I found myself particularly drawn to Robo and Lily.\\n-Robo is an apathetic genius with a passion for microbiology. Beyond that, she can compose haiku on the spot using whatever source material her friends give her, and she enjoys modeling Japanese monuments\\nusing mikan (oranges). Truly, she is in a class of her own. But, on a softer note, Robo is deeply attached to her best friends. And, if I may make an assumption, she’s also deeply afraid of being alone. Through flashbacks, we saw a younger Robo lash out at Wota and Baka for suggesting that she attend a different high school than them because of her academic prowess. For a person normally so fish-eyed and composed, this moment was telling.\\n-Lily, on the other hand, is a socially observant pretty girl with pervy lesbian tendencies. So yeah.\\nFor shows like JoshiMuda, it’s also fun to keep track of the different dynamics amongst the supporting characters and the interactions between them and the main cast.\\n-For example, there is often a central pillar connecting all the dots, and in this show, it’s Baka. She was the first point of contact for Loli, Majo and Lily. Baka was also the intermediate between Majime and her crush, Robo.\\n-Other social groupings to watch out for in the series is the Loli + Lily + Majime trio and the Loli + Majo duo.\\nFurthermore, the main premise of the show may be slap-stick comedy, but in a way reminiscent of Gintama, it’s balanced out by serious/heartfelt moments. These scenes end up being unexpectedly impactful.\\n-Take the boy-meets-girl moments, for instance, between Takahashi and Robo. Takahashi fumbles around conversation-wise and ends up talking about weird nonsense, but that ends up leaving a positive impression on Robo. It’s just another example of the cyclical power this show has where nonsense goes full-circle and somehow works out.\\n-Secondly, Wota and Waseda. The show built up the “dramatic” climax between Wota and Waseda-sensei over the course of multiple episodes. For those unaware, it’s nothing inappropriate, but the resolution to this little saga was definitely fulfilling.\\nThere’s not much to say in terms of over-arching plot development, this being a character-driven anime, but I did like how the creative team didn’t gloss over the practical consequences of Baka being an idiot. And I’ve also become somewhat invested in unraveling the whole story of the main trio’s past.\\nAs a final note, how about that intro? It’s been a while since I’ve found myself not skipping the opening 90 seconds, even halfway through the cour/season.\\nTo sum, I honestly didn’t expect much from this show, but looks, as per usual, can be deceiving.

I\\'ve tried the most notable ones like Nichijou and Nichibros for a few episodes, but they just\\xa0weren\\'t my cup of tea. Typically, the Japanese style of comedic\\xa0delivery isn\\'t all that great: there\\'s often overuse of a straight man who\\'s always compelled to explain the joke, drawing out a joke\\'s length for too long, or over-the-top reactions and shouting. Either the joke is ruined, or it probably wasn\\'t funny to begin with.\\nJoshikousei no Mudazukai (Wasteful Days of High School Girls), or \"JK\" for short, does a better job at joke delivery than most other\\ncomedy anime simply because it generally doesn\\'t incorporate any of the norms that I\\'ve described. And there\\'s more than just that: there\\'s character development, heartwarming moments speckled here and there, as well as relatable times when you\\'d think, \"That\\'s literally me.\"\\nJK generally revolves around a main trio: Akane (\"Wota\"), Shiori (\"Robo\"), and Tanaka (\"Baka\"). Their chemistry together is wonderful: they frequently argue and mess with each other, but the understanding and commitment that they share makes them inseparable. In addition, the show manages to juggle with a wide variety of lovable\\xa0side characters quite well: each has plenty of screentime, is unique\\xa0in personality, and has every chance to interact with all\\xa0the others.\\nDespite being mostly a comedy, JK likes to stop abruptly with its shenanigans and keep it real for a few seconds. Sometimes we get a glimpse of Yamamoto wasting away in her room. Whenever Akane\\'s passion for writing manga is brought up, Shiori and Tanaka chime in with their support. And\\xa0Saku is seen crying into her grandma\\'s lap after failing every attempt to look more mature. I applaud these moments, as it\\'s always great to remind ourselves of the important, meaningful things in life. Fortunately, these moments aren\\'t intrusive at all, and the jokes always roll in at a good rate.\\nWith that said, there are some hefty complaints I have with JK, which have to do with the last two episodes, where the usual high ratio of comedic to serious tones is flipped.\\xa0 Apparently, in episode 11, the author of the manga felt the need to represent her relationship with her husband, and it ended up feeling shoehorned. As for episode 12,\\xa0there was plenty of unfunny/recycled jokes,\\xa0 as well as\\xa0times where I simply wasn\\'t sure if I was supposed to be laughing or not. Both episodes don\\'t have enough prior build-up for the drama to be effective, and the attempt to mix in some comedy with the drama doesn\\'t help either -- it only undermines.\\nThe rest of the show, however, is consistently hilarious and cute, and not much else can be said without spoiling any of the jokes. You\\'ll just have to\\xa0see JK for yourself.\\n8/10. Also, I can guarantee that you\\'ll never skip the OP.

It takes what we often take for granted, puts a nice metaphorical spin on it, and connects to us on a deep and heartwarming level that you would never expect in a million years.\\nKanojo (or Miyu), the main character of Everything Flows, is a college student who is just beginning to face the real world. As with many other independent college students, she is facing some tough times, but what makes her situation all the more interesting is how she is being bombarded with incessant change. She just recently moved\\nout of her childhood home, her friend/roommate recently left the apartment that the two of them split the rent for, and she’s had her applications rejected in her endless search to get a job. Needless to say, things are not looking too bright for Kanojo.\\nThe only one thing that has remained steady and consistent in Kanojo’s life is her cat, Daru. Kanojo’s mother found Daru when Kanojo was still a young child, and, although initially rejecting Daru, she learns to tolerate him. Over time, they grow together and form a deep relationship with each other. Their relationship has now developed up to a point now where Daru recognizes the hardship that Kanojo has to endure. Although there is not much that Daru can physically do, it is clear that he empathizes with her deeply.\\nIt should be noted that the entire storyline is told from Daru’s point of view, but it isn’t isolated to just that. By incorporating a number of flashbacks and cleverly integrated metaphors throughout the story, the screenwriters of this 4 episode series have created something that has just enough impact to leave an impression yet still not sound overly sappy. It’s truly just right: a masterfully crafted balance, as I would say.\\nAs for the art and sound, they are both well done. An easy, breezy OP & ED and well-timed music to leave an emotional impact – what’s there not to like? The animation and art are very consistent and does the trick for this show.\\nOverall, it’s a great watch. 28 minutes in total may not seem like much, but it does the trick for the context of this show. The simplicity of this show is its strongest selling point, and after watching this I’m sure that it’ll leave you thinking about your own life too.\\nOverall Grade: A-\\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'The mere minutes I\\'ve spent watching this short series was invaluable. Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows earned the utmost of my appreciation and respect for being able to make me cry in only roughly about 30 minutes. Only fewer anime can pull this off. And what\\'s more surprising is the fact that each episode from this series is only about 7 minutes long.\\nA certain someone once said that \"When you enjoy something, time pushes ahead quickly.\" . I unquestionably concur with this statement. When I play games, I sometimes become happy. And when I become happy, time moves forward swiftly without me\\nrealizing it. This also applies to when I watch anime, when I swim, and when I do other activities that makes me feel happy. However, this anime is so short. To such an extent that it\\'s illegal. It could\\'ve gotten a higher rating if it had at least 12 episodes. The story is solid, the art is stunning, the sound is beautiful, the characters are likable, and I enjoyed watching this series from start to end.\\nStory : 10/10\\nHave you ever wondered what animals think of us, humans? Nerds, Scientists, and Professionals had been arguing and debating about this particular subject for such a long time now. Why? Because we don\\'t know how they feel. We don\\'t have their mind, their body, their eyes, or their soul. We do not possess the technology to \"knows thoughts\" nor were we born with telekinesis, because such thing does not exist.\\nFormerly created by Shinkai Makoto, a man who is quite famous for his work : Kimi No Nawa, Kotonoha no Niwa, Tenki no Ko, Byousoku 5 Centimeter, etc.. Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows used to be aired in 2002, but was later on remade in winter 2016 by LIDENFILMS. This anime is an outlook of what a simple, black, and adorable cat think of his female owner as they grew up together. The story is quite simple. You could even say that you\\'re watching an anime version of an episode from \"Animal Planet\" or \"The Dodo\". However, the concept behind the story of Everything Flows is heart-touching and really shows how a simple story could become something so sentimental and worth contemplating.\\nWhen I began this series. My expectations were very low. Because this series is an anime. I feel insecure and paranoid of the ideology of \"anything is possible in anime\". This made me overthink about what this series would be like. Up until the point where I thought that the black cat in this show would engage in a sexual intercourse with the female protagonist.. ( sorry! but I had to say it! ). I didn\\'t want that to happen, so I felt even more paranoiac and felt hesitant to start the series. Fortunately, I later on reluctantly decided to start it anyways in hope of the fact that the series would not actually be what I\\'ve presumed it to be.\\nI was glad that my thoughts were deceiving me after I have completed the series. Though I was scared at times when the cat said \"love\" in its mind. The series was simply about a cat that had been adopted into a family of one mother and one daughter. They grew up together until the daughter had left her own mother in order to become an independent individual of the society. Bringing the cat along with her. The cat and the daughter then both continue their lives. Going through hardships and obstacles in life until time had separated them from each other.\\nThe simplicity of this show is its gem. The numerous amount of abstractions in this show is its treasure. These two alone gives me pleasure. The story is just so expandable that I ran out of words to describe its superiority. Within just 30 minutes, I have learnt so much from this anime. If there\\'s ever an advertisement for cats, and this series is shown? I\\'m hands down buying whatever the advertisement wants me to buy. Period.\\nArt : 10/10\\nLIDENFILMS had never been a big budget flexer ever since Initial D. All their series and movies\\'s art style and quality are either mediocre or satisfactory. But in spite of that, it\\'s kind of ironic that Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows had such a good and fluid art style and quality. Probably because of Sakamoto Kazuya? Perhaps. Anyways. The art was so good that I thought I was watching Tsuki Ga Kirei all over again. I don\\'t really have anything else to say for this since it\\'s already perfect and has no flaws whatsoever.\\nSound : 10/10\\nNice voice acting.\\nNice songs.\\nyes\\nCharacter : 10/10\\nIn this series, we have two main characters. Daru ( The Cat ) and Miyu ( The Owner ). As I progressed through the show, I have seen progressions of the character developments of the two as they grew up together. I\\'d say the CD succeeded its purpose as a slice of life although in such a short amount of time. As I said before, the simplicity of this show is its gem. So saying \"It\\'s not good enough because the anime is too short\" would be impolite. So I\\'ll just leave the CD here.\\nOther than the character developments. The characters are amiable and very adorable. Especially Daru. Although I\\'m a more fan of dogs. Cats are pretty dang cute too. The appearance of Daru really makes me feel soothing and really makes me want to pet a cat again. Aside from Daru, Miyu is also kind of hot. Could say she\\'d be a nice waifu material. But I\\'d rather let her live her life instead.\\nOther characters are also fine. The supporting characters did their role. Blah blah blah. Already perfect.\\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\nVery short but I enjoyed watching this series. I\\'ve also been quite busy lately, so seeing something fast paced and good really makes me be able to fit my time to watch anime into my schedule.\\nOverall : 10/10\\nOverall utter masterpiece. Very underrated. And very \"under\"rated. Everyone should watch this at least once. It\\'s not even long. Only about 30 minutes. It won\\'t suck your entire lifespan like Dragonball or anythin\\'.

It highlights their friendship through youth and focuses pretty heavily on how the cat sees her and tries to make her life better.  And that’s about it. The episodes are 6ish minutes long each so the story is pretty simple. But that’s why I’m gonna give this anime so much dam much credit. Yeah, it has a story that’s simple, but\\nthe way it’s told is really interesting so I felt completely hooked within the first 2 minutes.\\n8 - Characters: There’s also really only two characters that are important. The girl and the cat. Once again they chose perfectly to focus on just two characters given the length of the episodes, and so the way the characters interact with each other is great. They make it clear early on, that even though the cat does have dialogue neither the girl nor the cat can understand each other. Yet the way the girl talks about her life and the way the cat bounces off that giving his insight actually makes you feel like they’re actually best friends.\\n8 - Sound: Speaking of dialogue, the voice acting is really, really good. At first, hearing the cat with an adult male’s voice did feel kind of weird, but after a minute or so, the voice matches perfectly. Same goes for the girl, her voice is expressive without being whiny and really, what more can you ask for?\\n9 - Art: Now as far as art goes, I’d have to say this is probably my favourite thing about the anime, because the whole thing is just downright beautiful. No joke, almost every scene is worthy of being used as a wallpaper, they’re just that good looking.\\n8 - Enjoyment: So, if you’re looking for a pretty chill story that will keep you interested the whole 6 minutes, then I’d definitely recommend checking this one out. Yeah, it’s short, but for an anime to hook you on such lovable characters with such a simple story in such a short period of time, it’s pretty awesome.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"She and Her Cat Review\\nI'm not going to lie, this is an entertaining series. As a person who doesn't own pets, it's refreshing to see what it's like to own pets from a new perspective. She and Her Cat is one of those short anime that has an 8 minute run time and uses those 8 minutes per episode to their fullest. Let's get into the meat of this review though.\\nSTORY\\nSimple concept. A college student lives with her cat. Here's the twist: It's from the perspective of the cat. It's a nice twist, but it isn't a mind blowing concept. For what it does,\\nit does well. It engages the audience, has a nice pace, and has a good idea of what it wants to be. Since it's a show about a college student, it would make sense to have some kind of conflict. The daily troubles of college students (getting a job, paying bills, etc.) allows the audience to relate with the main female character.\\nThis show does know what it's doing, but the mundane is still mundane. Nothing crazy is going on, and although this isn't a bad thing, a little more conflict would be nice. This series even states in the first episode that (from the perspective of the cat) the main female character does the same thing every morning. This is used to highlight how, even in the face of hardships, the main female character can stay strong. It's a nice idea and it's well executed.\\nFor what this show does, it does well, but it doesn't go above and beyond with most of its ideas. It seems a little TOO emotional at times.\\nCHARACTERS\\nThere are only 2 characters as of episode one. Let's split this section between the two characters.\\nThe cat is simplistic. The cat knows its limits for what it can and can''t do to help and is grateful for its owner. He tries to comfort his owner and that's about it. Since we see the world through his eyes, we are restricted to the house as the setting. This adds to the idea of this anime being mundane.\\nThe main female character is characterized well. She is a strong, independent woman who doesn't fall in any of the tropes normally seen in anime. She faces hardships to her fullest and keeps trying in the face of failure. This allows the audience to relate with her struggles more easily and makes the story have a larger impact.\\nYou can see the bond between pet owner and pet within the first episode through the dialogue and through actions. This show utilizes the show, don't tell aspect of a visual medium most of the time, but falls off the deep end at times with how certain things are explained. The characters and characterization is, overall, strong and a breath of fresh air.\\nANIMATION AND SOUND\\nThe animation is beautiful, but as stated, the setting is in a house. There isn't much to mess up. When visuals of the outside world are shown, they are well drawn and attract the audience's eye. The art style is a little different from the norm, but again, it is a breath of fresh air.\\nThe voice actors are well chosen and fit their roles well. They don't over exaggerate their dialogue, which is nice. I don't like when a small conflict turns into a crying and yelling fest so it's nice to see external conflicts handled realistically.\\nThe music is also fitting, and the ending is soothing. That's another theme of this show, it's calming. Everything comes together to make a simplistic and calming story with some minor conflicts to keep the characters with something to do. The music adds to scenes, but nothing has stood so much yet that I would add it to my music playlist.\\nFINAL VERDICT\\nThis is a nice show to watch to relax. It's relate-able to both pet owners and people who go through mundane conflicts. It's relatively short episode lengths are good for quick viewing sessions while waiting around or to fill a quiet room with some noise for a little. Nothing stands out too much because of the perspective we are given, but this perspective also adds something new that we haven't seen much before. For what this show has to offer, it's worth a watch. I rate it a 4/5, but because it doesn't stand out in how it presents itself, I would say a 7.5/10 is more deserving.\\nI'm editing this review each episode to ensure the highest amount of accuracy in it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '52b16ca334feed3e86174cc4de37c0d4'}>,\n",

I was in a dilemma of finding a job when I was watching this, so I could relate to a degree.\\nArt\\nThis is where I had some mixed feeling. I knew where the spin-off is coming from, so I had a high expectation. But it wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it is very beautiful with the scenery and stuff, but it feels more like a painting than animation to me, since the lack of dimension is really bugging me. Especially when the cat is\\nblack and it turns dark for certain frames. It has a old animation feel though, which is kinda unique at the time where CGI anime is a thing.\\nSound\\nIt was good, but I don't remember it too well. I guess this is a good thing, since it means that there wasn't anything out of place, which means they did a good job in doing the cues and stuff.\\nCharacter\\nEach character is not complex and only plays a role. The cat plays the narration, the girl plays the girl in distress, the friend and mom are the person who concerned about the girl. I think the chemistry between characters are really well-mixed, and how they reacted to another person showed the character better. For example, how the cat gives cold shoulder to the friend is showing how the cat like the smell of the girl and the girl alone.\\nEnjoyment\\nThis has a sad tone throughout the series, and while there are happy times, it's hard to shake off the feeling that it's sad. Nevertheless, it's still fairly enjoyable, with the story well-written and we have only the cat as a narration.\\nOverall\\nI don't like shows with a sad tone, which I know this show is going to be. I might not rewatch this though, despite I have some good moments with it, since it doesn't really fills my need for laughter.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows tells the story of a cat and his owner from the perspective of the cat. It is such a simplistic concept, and yet it has instantly earned a place as one of my favorite shows of all time despite being in seven-minute episodes--which says a lot about how good this series of shorts is. After next Friday it will have finished after just four episodes, which is a shame considering just how well written it is, and it really shows off Shinkai Makoto's spectacular skill as a writer. I will highlight everything that makes this show spectacular in\\nthis review.\\nFirst things first, I'll talk about the characters and the story (because these two are heavily intertwined, making it easier to just lump them together). The cast consists of a cat, her owner and a handful of extremely minor supporting characters. With just two characters that get focused on and without it trying to push ahead with some kind of plot (somewhere in which a lot of other shorts fall flat), the story is heavily character driven. The overarching plot which is there is that the owner is struggling having just graduated from high school, and it shows how she is unable to push ahead in life. All of this is told from thr cat's perspective, and when I watch her struggle it really brings tears to my eyes due to just how genuine it feels when watching. The cat thinks about her past, we learn how the two met each other and about the characters, and it leads to a massive amount of relatable character development which leaves me feeling like I know the characters and their hardships, and it is what makes it such a great show.\\nAs for the other aspects of the show, you can see the thought which has gone into the little things which make this show that much better. The visuals are stunning, with the OP and ED having a watercolour art style akin to Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, and the soundtrack is beautiful and really makes the touching or relatable scenes that much moreso, as well as getting across the idea that this show is incredibly relaxing. The OST reminds me of the music that goes over a lot of Non Non Biyori, with the easiest parallel to draw being with Hidamari Michi to Ren Chon's relaxing overtones and tune.\\nAll in all, I am thoroughly enjoying this show. Honestly this is the closest thing to perfection I think I've ever seen, and it is definitely worth the time to watch.

Often, well-grounded shows that deviate from this are are chastised for being too depressing or not imaginative.

It's not a comedy and there isn't much action, just an\\nold cat recounting life with his human master. If you want a break from literally out-of-this-world fantasies and endless harems, this is a great little oasis.\\nAnimation:\\nThe animation is mixed with relatively basic drawing at times (with minimal shading and simplistic coloring- the cat is often drawn as just a single flat blob of gray) and some other rather nicely drawn scenes (such as the sunset in episode two). Overall, it pans out to something between the overly simplistic style of Tonari no Seki Kun and what you'd expect from a full-length anime. A lot of scenes have the VAs talking while a single image pans around. There are only a few characters but they are well drawn, the cat though is a bit on the fat side.\\nSound:\\nThe show has a calming, instrumental OP and a voiced ED with somewhat sad undertones; both are fitting considering the overall mood of the show. There is a BGM present but it is not particularly special.\\nFor the most part, you'll hear the head voice of the cat, Daru, along with Kanahana convincingly voicing the un-named owner from childhood to adulthood.\\nStory:\\nThe show follows the life of a cat as he interacts with his owner, who starts out as a little girl. It gives a loving cat's interpretation of the world around him as he shares in his owner's happiness and grief. There is an abundance of the latter as real life is, well, truly tough at times.\\nThere are a total of four episodes, each about eight minutes in length, though if you take out the OP/EDs it's really just five and a half minutes of content.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"The title Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko directly translates as 'She and Her Cat'. The whole series of four 7-minute short episodes is precisely as the anime title says, 'She and Her Cat: Everything Flows'. This anime is about the lives of an unnamed college girl and her cat. The only twist is that the story is told from the cat's perspective.\\nStory: 8/10\\nFor beginners, don't expect a story with twists and turns. In the black cat Daru's perspective, Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko tells a modest story about how Daru lives his life with a junior college girl, who was only referred by him as\\n'She', after he was adopted to her family. Every now and then, Daru shows us some of his flashbacks when he was younger. The story focuses on a few important time frames of Daru's life, but the pacing is relaxed and easy to follow. I've rated 8 out of 10 because the story was very smooth, although strictly speaking, it might not even be called a story. The genre, as the MAL page points out, is Slice of Life; this Slice of Life revolves around Daru rather than She.\\nArt: 9/10\\nAgain, as the story itself is very relaxed and simplistic, hardly any special effects are used. All the scenes are everyday, ordinary scenes. The background are pretty detailed. They are well drawn and well displayed. The artwork is very round, as in with little ragged or sharp edges; this works well with the rather easy mood and tone of the story. The gentle colours used were also fitting to the scenes. The animation is very smooth.\\nSound: 10/10\\nThe only full mark lied in the 'Sound' category. The soundtracks as well as the ED felt very gentle, as were the story and its characters. The soundtracks are a perfect match to every scene, but they were very light as well. Not light-hearted, but very mellow, somehow. The voice acting was done perfectly. As I mentioned for a few times already, this series did not need anything out of the ordinary, and so was the sound for the characters. The voice acting fitted the characters, and that was more than enough. You'll see why in the next part of this review. The voices, along with the soundtracks, were extremely soothing. Even without the visuals, you could imagine how amazing the sound was portrayed.\\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\nThe main characters were Daru and the unnamed 'She'. Daru is only a domestic cat, but he is unbelievably psychological. Despite only being a cat, as his age progresses, we can see him become more mature and reflect upon life; not just his own, but his and Her's the same time. He is also practical, often thinking about how to cheer Her up. However, at the end of the day, he is just a cat, so he only sees in his scope, and doesn't really care about anything in the outside world. In his life, there is only She and himself, and for him it was sufficient.\\nShe was just another ordinary girl. She tries to become independent as she grows up, with only Daru being beside her everyday. She struggles to find a job, and struggles with family-related problems. There wasn't anything too remarkable about her, apart from her love for her cat, whom she refers to as Daru, humanising him instead of calling him anything cat-like.\\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\nKanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows tells a comforting and soothing story. I really enjoyed the process of watching; it felt bliss-like. The only points worth mentioning (that lowered the score) was the final episode, where the ending was told. Instead of using the last minute or so as an opening to a new story, more could be focused on Her feelings for him; the final part can be told in Her point-of-view instead of a third-person point of view.\\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\\nI really enjoy this type of anime: very real life-like, without any special twists, but just a purely soothing and gentle tale. I think this anime might be the best short series I will ever come to witness. With an almost-perfect 9 out of 10, I strongly recommend this anime to anyone, especially for those who enjoy calming Slice of Life series.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '45d350e393e339a45eb7fd32003f6589'}>,\n",

I feel that this anime could do a better job of fleshing out the perceptions of  Daru by making the show have more episodes. Keeping the episode length short to 7 minutes is great because it makes me feel like Daru's owner's relatives who are shut out by her withdrawal and the cat's narrative allows me to get closer to Daru's owner just as his presence brings the relatives closer to his owner.

       "  <Document: {'content': '[TL;DR: Short, sweet, too real. A story about a cat and her owner through life. If you are looking for a burst of feels and a reality check on your coffee break, look no further. 10/10]\\nCats are often misunderstood creatures. As the saying goes, dogs have owners, cats have staff. They are the bona fide royalty of pets, even tempered, strong willed, independent and don\\'t seem to care about much of anything other than a good meal, a comfy spot to sleep and getting into mischief when they are bored. But they can be surprisingly sensitive and caring, and they understand a lot more than\\nthey let on...\\n\"She and Her Cat: Everything Flows\" is actually an adaptation of the OVA short \"She and Her Cat\" from Makoto Shinkai (the director of 5 Centimeters per Second, The Garden of Words and Your Name). Not a direct adaptation, but an alternate re-imagining of the premise. \"Everything Flows\" is a story about life, as seen through the eyes of Daru, a black cat living with Miyu, an ordinary girl with ordinary problems. Being a cat, he doesn\\'t understand much about human life, but he still feels the pain, the struggle but also the beauty and happiness through the connection with Miyu. As time passes mercilessly, the elderly cat reminisces about the different stages of life he spent with her human. Joy, sorrow, depression, anxiety, as Miyu tries to figure out her place in life, so does Daru try to support her as much as a cat can, until his very last breath...\\nThey say sometimes less is more, and that\\'s perfectly true for this anime. Clocking in at only 6 minutes per episode (if you don\\'t count the OP and ED) in a 4 episode series, Everything Flows has a lot more content crammed into it than other anime usually offer in multiple seasons of droll exposition. Daru\\'s simplistic view of life offers a unique insight into our own world. From a cat\\'s angle, we are lot less complex creatures than we pride ourselves to be. Our overcomplicated problems seem a lot less daunting, when we could derive joy from the simplest of things, a beautiful sunset, the sound of rain on the windowsill, the steady rhythm of a train passing in the distance...and the love of an old soul purring softly in our lap. Sometimes, life\\'s biggest questions have stupidly simple answers, and there\\'s a lot we could learn even from an old black cat, if we were only to pay attention.\\nIn closing, \"She and Her Cat: Everything Flows\" is a beautiful piece of art. You can binge it in less than half an hour, but it will give you things to think about for weeks if not more. The art, animation and VO is excellent and the story is just too real. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who are looking for some soul-searching.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '753d6e437cd7b96974d5232382bb5fb9'}>,\n",

A lot of people liked it for its simplicity and could relate to the premise. Years later, the short would be adapted into a much longer manga, and someone else had the idea of expanding on the story in an anime format, called She and Her Cat: Everything Flows. I actually did see this show when it first came out, but during that time, I was hit with severe burnout and couldn't bring myself\\nto watch more than one anime a month. Now that I've finally managed to dig myself out of said burnout, I decided to revisit this one again because Discotek Media announced they licensed it and recently released it on Blu-Ray with an English dub. That was reason enough for me to go back to it, and I'm glad to say that it's a very cute, heartwarming series that deserves more love.\\nWhen Miyu was a young girl, her father died, and after moving to a new town, she's lonely and miserable. One day, her mother brings home a cute little black cat she named Daru, hoping he'd be a good friend to her. At first, Miu doesn't like the cat and wants nothing to do with him. But after some trial and error, they eventually become friends, and Daru spends his life with Miu, watching over her, seeing her grow, and spending every day by her side. Years later, both have grown up, and Miyu has moved out of her house to live on her own, though her decision has caused some friction between her and her mother. Now an adult, Miyu finds herself looking for a job, but it hasn't quite gone well so far. But Daru remains by her side, always supporting her and being there for her when she needs comfort.\\nIf you're looking for a short anime to watch, this only has four episodes, all of which are seven minutes long. But it has a relaxing atmosphere and is slow paced, making it perfect for it you want to take a few short minutes to wind down and have a cup of tea. The animation adds to this effect, with realistic character designs, a soft color palette, detailed backgrounds, and minimal movement, but just enough fluidity that the characters' actions, expressions, and gestures say a lot more than words do. The music is very nice as well, with gentle piano tunes that convey the slow monotony of Daru's days in his apartment, whether he's just putzing around the house or laying in his kitty bed, reminiscing about his life. The opening song by Kana Hanazawa (Which is only on the Blu-Ray version, not the TV version) is also very well done and well sung, very much like a lullaby. I'm a bit mixed about the ending song, as I think the vocals are a little too strong for my liking, but that's just nitpicking on my part.\\nThe cast for the show is extremely small, with only four named characters taking center stage, and all of them are pretty nicely fleshed out in the short amount of time they have. The animation also adds to the characterization, conveying the character's personalities, motivations, and worries without relying too much on dialogue or exposition, letting the characters express themselves by their own actions and their interactions with others. The show is mostly told from Daru's point of view, and being a cat, he doesn't quite understand what goes on around him, only seeing Miyu and the changes she undergoes every day, from coming home exhausted after a hard day, or when she's at a low point and needing a good cry. Having grown up with animals myself, I can say for sure that the creators did a great job in depicting Daru as just a regular cat, from the way he moves around to how he gives Miyu comfort even though he doesn't know what's going on or why she's sad. I do think some of his monologues tend to be a little too self-aware for a cat or more like a romantic admirer than...well, an animal. I can see what the anime was trying to do, and his monologues are nice to listen to, but some parts were a little much. But again, I'm probably nitpicking, and Daru himself is a well done character. Plus, it's easy to relate to Miyu and her struggles with both job hunting and her anxiety about becoming more independent, and she, her mother, and friend actually behave and talk like people rather than overexaggerated anime archetypes.\\nThis is a sweet, charming anime about a girl and her kitty that's gentle, heartwarming, and bittersweet at times, but it's the kind of anime I'm sure lots of people can relate to. I know I sure did! I had three cats growing up. Two of them died from old age, the most recent one being two years ago, and the other my family had to give away because she had health problems we weren't able to handle (Something I'm still sad about to this day), but I cherished all three of them throughout my life, and still do. I currently have a dog and she's proven to be just as sweet, loving, and nauseatingly cute as all the other pets I've had throughout my life. The anime does a perfect job of capturing the simple affection pets can offer us, and while the ending may not be to some peoples' personal taste, I personally thought it tied the show up perfectly.\\nBottom line, whether you've seen Shinkai's original short or not, this is a cute, sweet show that's sure to give you the warm fuzzies.

Though certainly not the most \"exciting\" show to air on Japanese television, it becomes strangely alluring in its own way, and leaves viewers wanting more.\\nStory: 9\\nThe story is rather laid back, not too complex. It doesn\\'t focus on about saving the world, helping a friend in dire distress, or even falling in love (that\\'s not to say that there aren\\'t any sweet dilemmas present). It\\'s a slice of life that revolves around the theme of\\ngrowing up and friendships that grow along with one\\'s stature. Yes, the story revolves around 4 (then 5) males. At first, one feels like this could NEVER be anything but yaoi (male on male anime/manga), but it is anything but that. Instead, Kimi to Boku brings a new light on a what could be an \"over-done\" subject. Poetic prose seasons the the memories of the various protagonists who wistfully (and sometimes regretfully) reminisce the past, their experiences more than 10 years ago still having strong influences and ties to what is happening at the \"now\" of their life. As for romance, you\\'ll have to see for yourself.\\nArt: 9\\nThe art is also not of the \"spectacular, melts the eyes and makes them bleed\" type. Those who are looking for sophisticated backdrops and blinding visual effects should look elsewhere. However, as with many anime of this genre, the art compliments the story (indeed nearly every aspect of the anime) with its simplistic and relaxing tones and hues. Simple though it may be, some of the ending credit \"snapshots\" are sure to curve even the most stubborn of lips. It did mine.\\nSound: 9\\nThe sound was what stood out to me at first. I understand it isn\\'t for everyone, but with the reviews out now that say that its \"okay\" leave me confused. The opening (\"Bye Bye\" by the artist \"7!!\") and ending (\"Nakumushi\" by the artist \"Miku Sawai\") are perfectly in sync with the series, and are totally worth hearing in their full versions (you guys do this too, right?). Personally, I find these artists\\' other songs worthwhile as well. As for the rest of the music, it isn\\'t perfect, but it is certainly well-matched and well-placed in each episode, and at times you can find yourself tapping your foot or even rocking your head to that catchy guitar.\\nCharacter: 10\\nThe other outstanding aspect of this anime are the characters. At first glance, they are flat and uninteresting. Four (then five, you\\'ll understand what I mean) high school boys: A very feminine, long-haired Matsuoka Shun, two rather good-looking yet otherwise un-noteworthy twins (Yuuki and Yuuta) who only speak in monotone voices, and a seemingly stereotypical, steady-type nerd (Kaname -> Megane). The fifth guy is something of a wild card. You\\'ll see.\\nBut, as the story progresses, it\\'s like watching a flower bloom. (Spare me your spit and jeers for saying it in such a way, but I won\\'t take it back.) The artist really pay attention to little details, and create such depth in these characters that you\\'ll find yourself wondering why you ever believed in Santa Claus. Each episode, viewers learn just a little bit more about these boys: what they were like when they were little and how they acted as opposed to how they are now - insignificant little details, things that seem unimportant yet hold some strange and precious place in their hearts. To these characters, the world is changed through these little details, and their bonds, it feels, are irreplaceable.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nIf it was meant to be exciting, this anime is not that great. It would deserve those careless sixes and sevens and be overshadowed by better shows. But it seems the artist wants to do something else. What else is there to life besides head-pounding, heart-rushing battle? Simple, sweet, everyday life. A cup of tea with friends. Fretting over school and girls. It\\'s these overlooked yet precious, precious things that one can only miss once they are over and naught but memories. Kimi to Boku brings wistfulness in a curious way, and stokes the fires of the heart. If anything, it\\'s real art.\\nOverall: 10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1b78dd53b13c7e8e4347dd477fcd65a1'}>,\n",

I\\'m not sure that is an accurate statement because each consecutive episode does build a bit on previous episodes as more and more is revealed about the character and characteristics of each player.  Some say it is a \"show about nothing\" and that I openly disagree with.  It is about love and acceptance, seeing someone\\'s foibles and loving them just the same.  Yes I said love but I mean universal love and and not the romantic sort.  KtB is about friendship, reflection, and personal growth.  How is that \"about nothing.\"\\nI could care less about the opening and ending songs and found the sound track in no way annoying, jarring or distracting so it must have done its job well.  I found the voice actors very well suited to the characters.\\nThe art is nice.  It is as mellow as the overall tone of the show. Then there are the cats.  CATS?  Brilliant, beautifully executed and illustrated vignettes of cats mirroring the actions and attitudes of the human characters -- ored cats.  playful, mischievous cats, annoyed cats.  Each character has a signature cat that reflects his personality and character traits.  These aren\\'t overly round, stylized cats but very realistic and richly detailed cats.  Ah, the Japanese do seem to appreciate and understand cats.  The \"cat mirrors\" is likely the most brilliant aspect of KtB.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I myself think that Kimi to Boku is a must watch show. I personally think that it doesn\\'t matter when and how often you watch it either. Kimi to Boku is one of those anime\\'s where you can come home from a rough day of work and watch. For me, I thoroughly enjoyed Kimi to Boku and I hope that after reading this review, you will too.\\nStory: 9\\nI really liked the story in Kimi to Boku. I like it\\'s simple school life style and I myself believe that the way the way they went about making this genre work, and not get boring, was really\\nwell done.\\nNormally in a lot of slice of life, school life anime it\\'s very easy to get bored. I\\'m sure well all know this well. But with Kimi to Boku the story hooked me at the start. The story in Kimi to Boku was simple, yet effective. At the end of the anime I didn\\'t feel the \\'void of emptiness\\' after watching it. Instead, I smiled to myself thinking, \"I really enjoyed that.\"\\nTrust me on the fact that you\\'ll laugh at the stupid things that happen and the giggles between characters.\\nArt: 9\\nFor these kind of anime\\'s I always think that it needs to be simple; and that\\'s what Kimi to Boku did. It kept it\\'s art simple and so, it wasn\\'t sore on the eyes. After coming home from a hard day of work you don\\'t particularly want to see vivid colors. The art style in Kimi to Boku was smooth, and I myself had no problems with it.\\nIt\\'s very pretty.\\nSound: 8\\nWhile watching Kimi to Boku I thought to myself every time  I heard a soundtrack play, \"I\\'ve heard this before...\" The soundtracks in Kimi to Boku are very repetitive and so, it at times may not be ear candy. In the first half of the first episode of Kimi to Boku not much music played at all. Though, I believe myself that it was made like that to make the pacing seem slower and to make it seem more realistic. Towards the end of the anime, they play more soundtracks and for me, that\\'s ok. I would\\'ve put sound at a seven if it wasn\\'t for the fact that even if the soundtrack is repeated more than a few times, they were good soundtracks. Kimi to Boku used the right soundtracks at the right time and that\\'s not something every anime can do.\\nThe sound effects in Kimi to Boku weren\\'t much to talk about but they were there. They made me laugh too. :)\\nCharacter: 10\\nWow. This anime made me love every character. There was not one character I hated. The character development in this anime was very good and I became attached to them. What I was in awe about was the fact that even if a character only had one episode, you could still call them a character. They seemed just as important as the main characters and had an amazing amount of character development for such short time that they had.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nThere\\'s not much I can say here since I\\'ve pretty much already stated above my opinion and enjoyment out of Kimi to Boku. Every end to every episode left me wanting more. It was a very enjoyable anime and if you decide to watch it then I hope you enjoy it too. I remember not being able to wait until I got home to watch this anime. I hope you feel that way also.\\nOverall: 10\\nKimi to Boku is a hit or miss honestly. It\\'s like marmite; you either love it or you hate it. The slice of life genre isn\\'t something for everyone but, even if you dislike slice of life, give the first few episodes a try. I myself don\\'t particularly watch slice of life unless it\\'s striking, and this was. It seems simple yet the comedy and the characters in it will make you smile. The sound is good, the art is cute and smooth and the story is just what a normal highschooler may want their life to be like.\\nGive Kimi to Boku a try, I really enjoyed it.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '362b181e8b8564145ade2f6c8b481385'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"This is my first time writing a review, so please be gentle, but Kimi to Boku more than deserves something nice being said about it for once. I'm a huge fan of the manga, so I'm a little biased, but, I'll keep focused on what my thoughts are for the anime only.\\n-Story-\\nThe plot of this series revolves around five high school boys who have known each other since childhood. Kimi to Boku falls under the 'slice of life' category, because that's exactly what it is. If you're expecting something that's action packed or has a fast pace, this anime will likely disappoint you, because it's\\nneither. But, this is one of the reasons that this series is so great; it's simple. It deals with the every day lives of these five boys (Kaname, Shun, Yuuta, Yuuki, and Chizuru) and the people they interact with. Each episode they are faced with new life challenges that are easy for the viewer to relate to. Though, this series also focuses on the boys' pasts, showing little segments to explain traits that they continue to show in present time or to reflect on a previous relationship with each other or one of the other characters.\\nDrama hardly exists in Kimi to Boku, other than adorable, friendly squabbles or the occasional love interest dilemma. This, can either come across as boring to a viewer or as something that's soothing compared to the other anime that they might watch. To me, Kimi to Boku is a breath of fresh air. While other animes may be nerve-wrecking or stressful to watch, this anime is so enjoyable to me. Every time I sit down to watch it, I can just feel myself melt into the world of these characters and I find myself helplessly falling in love with their situations.\\nPersonally, I enjoy the slow pace of this anime. It's slow enough to simply enjoy watching it, but fast enough to where I'm never bored watching it.\\n-Art-\\nThe art of this anime is very similar to Hotta's art in the manga. Both are drawn simplistically, which fits perfectly with the series' simplistic plot. The characters are drawn with detail that is just enough, not messy, but not overwhelmingly complex. Each character get's his or her own unique look and features, making them easy to distinguish between them and easy for someone who's new to the series catch on and remember their names. Although, something that I really enjoy with the anime is the beautiful pallet of colors. The anime has very soft, warm colors. The scenery of the backgrounds often involving cherry blossoms or beautiful sky images. The colors and the atmosphere of this anime only add to the beauty of this series' complicated-simplicity.\\n-Sound-\\nThe music is alright. The background music is not overwhelming and doesn't seem to distract the viewer from the character interactions, instead, it seems to just perfectly fit with the rest of the atmosphere. The opening and ending themes are cute, although, the music all together is not very memorable. It just fits.\\nRather than talking about the music in the series, I'd like to stress how perfectly cast the VAs are for these characters. I'm a fan of the drama CDs, so I didn't really know what I was expecting by being introduced to a new cast of VAs for the characters. I was a bit hesitant about it, to be honest. But, after watching the first episode, I was more than pleased. I actually had butterflies, because I think the cast did an incredible job portraying these characters exactly how they were meant to be shown. Shun is soft and meek, Kaname comes off being overwhelmed and aggravated, Chizuru is obnoxious and loud, the twins are smooth and perfectly quiet. These aspects of their personalities are easily shown in the VAs' voices. They are easy to decipher from one another, which is especially important with the twins.\\n-Character-\\nI've been stating over and over how delightfully simplistic this series is, but the characters are anything but simple. Each character is something special, each character feels like a main character, and each character is able to blend with the rest of the cast. Focusing on our main five boys, each of them have a special relationship with one another and interact with each other in different ways. Though, one criticism that this series has gotten is the 'BL' aspects that the show gives off. It's all about perception, if you want to see a deeper relationship between any of these characters, then you can easily see one, if you chose to view them as just being a set of close friends, then the BL elements are hardly overwhelming. These characters are for everyone who wants to enjoy them, this series is NOT just eye candy for fangirls.\\nI won't go into the detail of each of the boys, to avoid spoilers, but, I think their different personalities and the different ways that they react to each other is something that's very special. Each character is incredibly likeable and each one is someone that the viewer could relate to someone they know in real life, or even themselves.\\nI have nothing bad to say about any character in this entire series (even the ones that have not made their appearances yet) and that's something really miraculous for me. I generally like only a few characters from each series, but, I can honestly say that I love every single character very dearly and have related to each of them in some situation or another. This is by far my favorite part of this series.\\n-Enjoyment-\\nWhat's not to enjoy about Kimi to Boku? Nothing is unlikable about adorable characters interacting with each other in adorable ways. There's heart, there's humor, there's tiny bits of drama, and just a lot of love between the cast. I fully enjoy this series and find myself laughing at various times, although, it seems like every time I watch a new episode, the smile won't disappear from my face. It's impossible for me not to enjoy watching these character's bonds grow and change, and watch the events that lead up to these changes.\\n-Overall-\\nThis anime gets high marks from me, especially because it's an adaptation. Usually, adaptions are done poorly, and viewers often get the wrong idea about the series by the lame anime adaption that an amazing manga got; though with Kimi to Boku, I love both the anime in the manga. I highly recommend anyone who's falling in love with these characters, or even enjoying themselves in the slightest, to read the manga. The manga is even more incredible than the anime, although, the anime is very close to being perfection. There are, of course, changes that have been made in the adaption, but, this series has a very nice flow, and I am ecstatically awaiting seeing the rest of this season's episodes, as well as the second season.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7c85e6ccd225753445078d5a746f35fc'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Kimi to Boku is a series about a group of four (later five) teenage boys and them finding things to do in their everyday lives. And...that\\'s it, really.\\nKtB is truly a slice-of-life show, but I am of the opinion that even SOL series deserve actual plots and in this way, KtB falters. There isn\\'t much plot to speak of. Most of the time, the \"plot\" deals with the boys doing ho-hum everyday things, like reliving childhood memories, drawing manga, or even contemplating what to do because they\\'re bored (I kid you not). Every now and then, things get somewhere interesting - for example, the cultural\\nfestival episodes were fun, as was the venture to the boys\\' former middle school, where they meet Shun\\'s younger brother. Other episodes were downright boring and entirely forgettable; these mostly dealt with the boys sitting around and talking about things (I can\\'t even tell you what of because I don\\'t remember and frankly don\\'t care). Indeed, I nearly fell asleep during the first episode because all the characters did was talk and relive flashbacks that weren\\'t that interesting.\\nNow, a lacklustre plot can be somewhat forgivable if the series had great characters. For the first few episodes, our main cast of boys numbered four - Shun (the soft-spoken, effeminate one), Kaname (the straight man and the glasses guy), and Yuuki and Yuuta (the twins). However, they\\'re all either so quiet or deadpan that they don\\'t make for a very entertaining group to watch. Like I said, the first episodes deals entirely with them talking about things. Even the introduction of the stereotypical tsundere in the second episode doesn\\'t help spice up what little plot there is. In fact, the tsundere, Masaki, is one of the more annoying characters, who is more \"tsun\" than \"dere\" and gets upset at the tiniest offer of help. For the record, she doesn\\'t get much better by the end of the series.\\nThe group only really livens up when the fifth member, Chizuru, is added. His boundless energy and enthusiasm adds a different dynamic to the main cast - he contrasts well with the deadpan twins and the quieter Shun and gives the straight man Kaname a better character to work off of for comedic effect. At the same time, he adds a bit of a love triangle with Masaki (the tsundere). Still, Chizuru alone isn\\'t enough to save the plot from its own blandness. Nevertheless, the show does become less boring with him around because at least when they sit around and talk, there\\'s some energy in it.\\nAlso, in later episodes, the group comes across other characters who, through their own plots or development, give the main cast some depth that we would otherwise not see. For example, when Yuuta goes on a date with a shy classmate, we get a glimpse of his personality underneath his emotionless exterior. Unfortunately, such instances seem to occur only when they meet people outside their group rather than when the main cast is together. I would have liked to see the main guys develop within their group as well as without, like in the case of Ouran High School Host Club.\\nAnimation-wise, there isn\\'t much to see. That\\'s not to say it\\'s bad; it\\'s just simple because that\\'s all the show requires. Basically, there\\'s nothing notable about it, good or bad.\\nIn terms of sound, the music, like the animation, isn\\'t very notable or memorable for anything. I\\'ll admit, though, I have a fondness for the OP \"Bye Bye\" by 7!!, which has cute melody and a catchy opening beat. I have no complaints about the voice actors/actresses, who I guess had to work within their given characterizations.\\nSo, really, is there anything truly notable about Kimi to Boku? Well, no. Is it a bad show? Well...that depends on how you see it. Frankly, I don\\'t think of it as bad but it\\'s far from memorable. Other slice-of-life series I\\'ve seen had something to distinguish them - Aria had a beautiful utopian society with a dash of fantasy; K-ON! had catchy music and \"moe\" girls; Azumanga Daioh had off-beat humour and even more off-beat characters. Kimi to Boku has...cats? Look, I don\\'t know, I\\'m trying.\\nIf you like action, drama, and fast-pace plots, then Kimi to Boku is not for you. If you like slice-of-life, give it a try but if you don\\'t like it by the third or fourth episode, it\\'s probably not for you, either.\\nEDIT: It\\'s been about 2 years since I finished this series and wrote this review.

Kimi to Boku has nothing of the sort. Its simply a very pleasant anime to watch for both guys and girls. I'm a straight guy myself and I had no trouble watching this so lets get that misconception out of your mind.\\nSo the anime's about a group of friends. Four childhood friends and a blondie who happened to get intertwined with them. There's no plot, so to say coz the anime just shows you incidents from their high-school years but that's\\nmore than enough to tell you that this anime is only for those who truly enjoy Slice of Life themes and love simplicity amalgamated with humor. For those who don't... Best move along, find something more mature.\\nLike I mentioned, the anime is simple. Its art is simple. The music is simple. The jokes are simple. And then there are the characters who seem simple enough but are so much more than that. Again, each of the 5 characters behave uniquely and they're all opposites of each other, in a way. Even the twins are distinguishable by actions, clearly. As the story builds on, throwing anecdote after anecdote of their lives, these instances only get funnier by the episode. The characters are drawn to look very adorable, though some of the female characters are hard to distinguish from each other. The pace is kinda laid back and slow but still engaging with all the moments that can either make you laugh or urge you to recollect instances from your past. With the first season, it has also ventured into mildly romantic themes though it'd really take the next season to tell you where they lead. All in all, the focus is solely friendship and they've nailed that through, perfectly. They've also got cats. A lot of 'em.\\nI was blown away by both, the opening theme as well the ending song, especially the ending where they've applied the beautiful effect of cross-fading the start of the song with the last few seconds of the anime which makes the episode all the more special. The rest of the music that is featured is also pleasant and fitting for the setting of the anime. Not much to criticize since the anime has accomplished all it had aimed for. The only thing might be the lack of an evident storyline but it makes up by delivering in everything in a non-cliche, non-cheesy manner. It starts off rocky but peaks quickly and stays there. So do persevere the initial 2~4 episodes, at least. Did I mention they have a lot of cats? :3\\nSo what is Kimi to Boku?\\nIt is the perfect episodic anime to add to a tough day at work since it calms you down perfectly without provoking the least complex of thoughts. I recommend this to everyone looking for something light to watch while following something rather heavy.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'It\\'s not a Boy\\'s Love so what\\'s the point in watching this?\\nI love slice of life animes, I try to look for them whenever I can, and when I say Slice of Life i mean true Slice of life, not Slice of life in space or slice of life with magical powers. What I love about slice of life animes is the realism with the stories in characters, I love watching things that could possibly happen in real life. Sadly there are too many supernatural stories listed as Slice of life. So when I read the description for Kimi to Boku I was really happy,\\na true slice of life story FINALLY! I was eager to sit down and watch.\\nThe first episode introduce us to the characters who had been friends for many years blah blah. I won\\'t go into the details because you should know the story by now from reading the description.\\nThe first episode wasn\\'t that exciting, but I forgave its lack of excitement because it was the first episode and we were just getting to know the characters and at first I thought the random cat shots were odd, but they grew on me and actually it is the only thing about this show that is interesting.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, the show had some good episodes, such as the one with Yuki playing with a foreign boy when they were young. It was cute and just shows that even if kids can\\'t speak each other\\'s languages they will find ways to get around that and have fun.\\nHowever, the good is not enough to keep me glued to the story..why? Because there is no story. So far each episode is more like a \"this happens in this episode\" type of deal. Such as Episode five can be wrapped up as \"Girl loses key chain\" The fourth episode was \"Kaname gets sick\" this is really a nothing happens show. I guess it wouldn\\'t be so bad if the characters were interesting, but they aren\\'t. They are all stereotypes you can find in other animes like Ouran Host Club, except Ouran host club characters were actually fun to watch.\\nNot only are the characters uninteresting but the overuse of flashbacks really weigh the show down because they have nothing to do with anything that is happening in the episode, but then again since nothing is happening in the episode the flashbacks seem even more pointless. Flashbacks should enhance the story while giving the audience important info. Do we really need to know for the one millionth time that Kaname had a crush on his Kindergarten teacher? I think we have had four flashbacks on that alone. yep four on just that and we are only on episode five. (Although, thankfully there were none in the fifth) this show relies heavily on flashback storytelling, but the flashbacks leads to nowhere. i found myself not really looking forward to the next episode and I only watched the fifth episode to give it a decent chance.\\nHere are my pet peeves that really makes me not want to continue:\\nThat little girl is annoying. What is up with animes that either have the super sweet boring girl or the annoying brat b**ch? Like girls are all one extreme or the other. Why can\\'t they just have a cool girl to hang out with, who is regular and likes to play around too?\\nShun, the pink haired boy is the male version of the super sweet boring chick. Now look, I don\\'t mind girly boys but don\\'t throw a girly boy into the mix and then not give me some sort of a gay storyline. at least attempt a coming out story (although I\\'m sick of those at least it is something) and no he doesn\\'t have to fall for one of his friends (although at least there would be an actual story here). seriously, this kid is just gay, so gay his pillow was pink and had ruffles on it when they were kids. If they try to make him straight by giving him a female love interest (and no that annoying little brat is not a love interest) then I would just laugh cause he obviously does not like Va***as and neither does Yuki(one of the twins) for that matter. But he just stands around as the sickeningly sweet mother figure of the group.\\nChizuru Tachibana. Soooo he was a German (I had to correct this, I thought Russian at first) boy who could not speak Japanese, yet not he is the most Japanese like out of all of them. And his name irks me more than anything. Why couldn\\'t the writer look online or something and find a name suitable to his nationality?? I didn\\'t know he was half Japanese until i read the synopsis here but it still irks me because why does he have to be half Japanese? Oh yeah so they wouldn\\'t have to waste time looking up foreign names.\\nOkay I\\'ve said enough. But this all leads back to my first sentence. I\\'m not some yaoi maniac that NEEDS yaoi in every story, but since there is no plot going on here they might as well give us some BL to make this worth looking at.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '861f726a950b58497f851d1b9e50b420'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"It's really hard reviewing a series after it first came out, so please bare with me. (Note: this review will be updated throughout the course of the released episodes)\\nKimi to Boku (You and Me) is an anime that revolves around 5 childhood male friends who have started their second year of high school.\\nStory\\n--------\\nThe story is pretty fair so far. Since it is a slice-of-life anime, the pacing might be a little too slow for some people, whereas others can find it to be calming. I personally think that this anime could develop into something bigger and more entertaining as the episodes progress. There is so\\nmuch potential for a slice-of-life revolving around an entire male cast and their daily lives, unlike the typical 'moe girl' one. This might be one of those few rare findings where the entire main cast consists of boys, but it does not belong to a shounen-ai category, which is a good thing for those who are not a fan of that genre, although shounen-ai lovers can enjoy Kimi to Boku the same.\\nArt\\n--------\\nThe art is 'ok'. I have not much to comment about it. It isn't very detailed or very plain, but somewhat in the 'neutral' zone. One thing I immediately noticed upon watching this series is the character's 'eyes'. Even though there is not much to complain about them (they ARE rather unique in terms of style), but in the end you get used to this art type and go along with it. The colors are pretty calming and soothing.\\nSound\\n---------\\nNot much to say about the sound. It's pretty decent, and flows along with the plot line. The slow scores and cheerful ones fill in the gaps of the 'everyday life' feel.\\nCharacter\\n---------\\nThe characters are pretty likable, and since this series has just started, we don't know much about their background. They all fit into the typical stereotypes, although some produce a good fair amount of uniqueness in them. In the end, the viewer is able to relate to and enjoy the character's actions.\\nShun -> Many complain that he looks like a girl, but because of promotional art, we know that he'll soon cut his hair (maybe that will bring all the 'complaints' down). He's a pretty likable character and is the 'optimistic' one out of the group.\\nYuki -> Likes manga, the younger of the twin brothers. Is quiet.\\nYuta -> The older twin, talks a bit more. Not much is known about him, till now.\\nKaname -> The strict one who keeps all the friends in order. Despite the fact that I don't really relate characters from different series, Kaname gave me the 'Kyouya' feeling (Kyouya from Ouran High School Host Club).\\nChizuru -> Still did not make his appearance.\\nEnjoyment\\n--------------\\nThe pace is slow, but mellow. This might change after more episodes are released though. overall, I think one can enjoy Kimi to Boku pretty well. If you hate slow every-day-life ongoings, then I don't recommend this series, although, as I mentioned before, this is an 'early series' review, so this might change with the introduction of more characters, and possibly a 'plot'.\\nOverall\\n---------------\\n7/10\\nDecent anime with quirky characters and a stable storyline. As I mentioned (countless of times) this might change soon (my rating might either rise or drop). If you're a fan of slice of life and would like an anime that focuses on the everyday life of male students, then Kimi to Boku is your anime.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd2ef2748f0e73700eba3a56fc2c8c832'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Extremes can fail, even in anime, but Kimi to Boku pulls it off.  This is a show based on the manga of the same name, that in a phrase is the Seinfeld of highschool anime shows.\\nNo, I\\'m not referring to its popularity or critical reception, but to the fact that while most other shows have a gimmick, Kimi to Boku is essentially a show about nothing.  This is slice of life anime taken to its extremes, and as someone who enjoys the genre (guilty pleasure), it\\'s sort of fun.\\nEarly reviews of the series berated it for its predictability  \"oh there\\'s the\\ntsundere, we know how that will turn out!\" but the show takes those expectations and turn them on its head.  The character is quickly relegated to a supporting role and exits the narrative until much later, and ultimately doesn\\'t affect the narrative in any meaningful way.\\nAlthough there is the faintest character and narrative arc, each of season 1\\'s 13 episodes are essentially self-contained vignettes on the life of a group of high school kids (mainly focusing on the boys).   Call it gender preference, but in a way, the focus just on the male shenanigans sort of reminds me of my own high school experience with my clique of friends.  The romantic melodrama is relegated to the side.\\nIf, after all this, you\\'re still undecided on whether to take the plunge,  I can also mention Cats.  Yes, this show cuts away to shots of Cats and kittens as a kind of narrative punctuation, ending a scene, splitting a scene of exclaiming a scene.\\nOh, the watercolor look that seems to be in vogue of late also works brilliantly in this show and features one heck of an opening song.  I\\'ve  drifted away from JPOP since graduating from university but Bye Bye! is one catchy tune that I can\\'t stop playing.\\nKimi to Boku isn\\'t going to win any awards or top anyone\\'s lists, but it is genuine, and just a lot fun to watch.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c8d81451ec08a9b88c9ae61677c6f386'}>,\n",

I just wanted to tell everyone what i feel about this anime, that i feel very close to me-\\nHave you ever had a group of friends you care a lot? Kimi To Boku is a story about the everyday life of five teens, bound together by the most beautiful relationship that can be established between people: friendship. Representing quite normal situations, Kimi To Boku can warm the heart of the spectator, through the use of beautiful phrases, moving soundtracks, and the feeling of closeness with the situations that happen to the protagonists. If you have special friends in your life,\\nyou would understand that Kimi To Boku is a much more deep and moving anime than it seems. But if you don\\'t, you\\'ll maybe just enjoy a normal slice-of-life anime, without knowing how much fantastic this anime is.\\nStory: 9\\nKimi to Boku has no particular plot, so it\\'s not fair to give full marks to it. However, the simplicity represented by this anime succeeds in every way to involve the viewer, making it enjoyable until the end of each episode. I found great the use of past scenes of the protagonists, which outline a simple but also stable plot. Also, some scenes will make you laugh out loud, but other scenes are very touching. It\\'s impossible to be bored watching this anime.\\nArt: 10\\nThe art of Kimi to Boku is very simple, yet so beautiful. First, it is almost totally devoid of the stereotype of the \"unnatural colored hair\" typical of Japanese cartoons (except for Shun, who has red hair, but hey, even I have natural red hair, so it\\'s okay!). The style vaguely reminds me of other animes as Usagi Drop, that I\\'ve always praised for its exquisite designs and vibrant colors. Another thing to praise are the drawings of cats in Kimi to Boku, almost perfect, they look so real.\\nSound: 10\\nProbably, the soundtrack to Boku Kimi is the best thing of all the anime. Starting from the opening, which I believe is one of the best among all the anime ever made, until the ending, which is also wonderful, all the soundtracks in it are very well made, and that\\'s especially thanks to them that the whole anime creates an atmosphere of happiness mixed with a nostalgic feeling. It gives the spectator the sensation of good memories, remembered with nostalgia and melancholy, which is perfect in the anime context.\\nCharacter: 10\\nThe 5 main characters are different from the typical anime chracter stereotype.\\nShun is feminine, tender and altruist, the typical \"good person\" that can hardly be found as a main character in an anime.\\nYuta, Yuki and Kaname have kinda the same cool attitude, but they\\'re nothing like the typical cool characters which not comunicate with anyone and are closed in themselves.\\nChizuru is the classical genki boy, maybe the only stereotype in the serie, but also a good character that i\\'ve appreciated a lot.\\nI also love the other characters: they are more attached to the classical stereotypes, but their presence in the anime is very important for the plot develop.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI love this anime. As I said, the fantastic soundtrack, the funny situations, the never boring characters, the good art and the heart-warming situations make this anime very enjoyable and watchable by everyone.\\nOverall: 10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '42184560fa741c0c01a5f6756b26261d'}>,\n",

He can do a very good connection between the characters, story and comedy, something few shows of this genre can do.\\nHe tells the story of four boys during childhood friends from high\\nschool live in situations where ordinary life of a student, Yuuki, Yuuta (they are brothers), Shun and Kaname give life to this show and are responsible for the success of this true work while Shun is more delicate and at times looks like a woman and is more fanciful, like cooking, Kaname makes the style more serious, studious and learned (but do not think that it is not funny!) and finally Yukki and Yuuta twin brothers where each one has its own personality and the same time you like surprises and confuses dois.No wait until a show with adventure, drama, action, he has nothing but it is a nice anime to watch and very fluid and clean.\\nHis comedy is not forced in any way and is really fun is natural, loose, makes you laugh in every episode you watched, linked to good music that combines with past scenes, great graphics are extremely detailed and engaging characters that you can identify the voice acting is particularly good and is the highlight of this show dubbing combine comedy with an amazing way and that the brightness of the show, I think the show just becomes funny because of dubbing done extremely well and I believe anime genre for those who really his strong point but this has to be is meaningless and lifeless, each genre needs a strong point such as suspense, mystery songs have happy and funny ends the show as well as an anime adventure can not only obscure songs, but continued to speak well of the show, it's really amazing how well the producers chose the songs for each scene, and how each character has their own life and still the place for a bit of romance but do not expect the anime to focus on it after his main genre that is not (as much as an anime has always various genres will focus on one of them and Kimi to Boku is comedy! romance not) the novel appears in a few episodes I believe in a 4 but is well it feito.Each episode has a different story which makes everything funnier and more Slice of Lifes animes that may seem a bit monotonous this genre is on the rise lately and is constantly evolving and this show is proof he's no little boring and monotonous and really stands out from others in the same genre, it takes real life situations and turn them into a really fun comedy.\\n================================================== ========\\nStory: 8\\nSince this is an anime comedy is difficult to give a note to his story as each episode it is one different story with a beginning middle and end their focus is not on it but I will try an average of each episode and give an overall score.\\nArt: 8\\nThe anime has 3 strengths, and art is one of them (next to the sound and the comedy and the characters) really his art is extremely detailed and well done, you do not notice major flaws and scenarios are well defined and you get to itself felt in the scene as the character.\\nCharacters: 8\\nAnother strong point of the anime, the characters are not fully worked in front psychological, sentimental, but somehow they captivate you and you begin to get involved in the story with them, you start to like them and identify with them, is Funny how each character had his personality well developed and has its special peculiarities such as the twins Yuuki and Yuuta while the other one loves mangoes does not support this and do not even have a special taste, particular attention to the character Shun that in some moments recalls a woman is really funny how it looks like one, another highlight for the character I most identified myself Tachibana and the silly boy group that does everything becomes still best to watch each scene it really is incredible funny!\\nSound: 9\\nOne of the high points of the anime really your sound is excellent since the opening song to the closing and the songs used in each scene and how producers had amazing care of this detail seems so irrelevant but that's life when the anime is as well used if this show really fantastic!\\nEnjoyment: 9\\nFUN!! so you will not miss seeing this show, it is easy to watch, is not complex does not have those dramas and complicated things to understand he is totally straight, fluid and extremely funny!

       "  <Document: {'content': \"This is a strangely addictive overdose of easy-going saccharine slice of life sweetness. I mean, I thought the first episode was totally bleh and yet I kept watching and in the end I became addicted. I hear cocaine works like that. Oh, wait, I wasn't supposed to say that out loud.  Ahem, anyway, on we go…\\nStory:\\nThe story is about the everyday lives of five friends. And when I mean everyday I mean hardcore everyday. There are exciting occurrences like buying stuff from vending machines, eating lunch and making photocopies (I'm not shitting you, this really happens). And yet, despite the uneventful storyline, this show\\nbecomes strangely addictive. Perhaps it is the innocence and sweetness it exudes, perhaps it's the nostalgia of the happy schooldays you never had or even the ideal picture of friendship it presents. Whatever the reason, it is a very captivating story despite the detail that NOTHING HAPPENS! There is no conflict, no angst, no drama just a series of sweet little nothings. Sometimes, that is just what you need.\\nCharacters:\\nTwins Yuuta & Yuuki: are a pair of lazy deadpan overachievers who love trolling people. At first, I did not much take to them because they were strictly reactive and passive characters. Yet, in the end they prove to be the source of some extremely snarky comedy moments.\\nKaname: is the exemplary, rigid student with a fetish for older women. His function is to be the straight man in many of the funny moments.\\nShun: is a totally girly boy who is gentle, kind, sensitive and loves baking and the colour pink. He provides the group with emotional support and he's also my ideal wifey…oh, wait, I wasn't supposed to say that out loud. Ahem…moving on.\\nChizuru: is the outsider that eventually becomes a part of the group. Many think he is an annoying, hyperactive brat but if you think about it his character is really necessary. He is the epitome of an energetic, active character. This is a quality none of the other characters possess, hence he is needed to balance things out.\\nSo, there you have it. At first glance the characters appear overly simplistic yet as you continue watching you see a wonderful fleshing out process. In the end you feel as if you actually know them and would really like spending time with them.\\nAnimation:\\nNothing stellar and often sub-par. Yet this is not a show that requires flashy visuals so it makes no difference really. There is a lot of empty space, pastel colours and soft movements. Very soothing to the eye; it's like eating cotton candy actually.\\nSound:\\nThe sound was so discreet I don't even remember it being there. I mean, there must have been some sound but for the life of me I can't recall any of it. Well, maybe I was just so focused on wanting Shun for my pet. Oh, wait, I wasn't supposed to say that out loud…\\nOP: A sequence of small moments to introduce the characters matched by a simple, bubbly little ditty.\\nED: A sequence of static pictures (stills: the budget anime's best friend) matched by a simple, cute little ballad.\\nOverview:\\nThis anime is basically worth a 7 but I am giving it +1 for the frequent, random shots of freaky cats.\\nWill this show appeal to most people? No. It is too slow and uneventful. But if, on the other hand, you are fond of slice of life, sweet innocence and soothing lassitude you will like this. I certainly find myself looking back on it fondly and might actually want to re-watch it someday.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e4f29d53c3d9c44e2c280556b86876f3'}>,\n",

I absolutely regret not re watching this anime anytime sooner! At first when the anime came out I'd always get exited every week after school to watch the anime- though I haven't felt much anticipation since so I've always thought KB was a delightful series.\\nKimi to Boku would be your typical cute and wonderful slice of life shoujo anime, revolving around four childhood friends (basically best\\nfriends)Tsukahara Kaname, Matsuoka Shun, Asaba twins Yuuki and Yuuta, that have known each other since preschool and now are second year high schoolers.

Though this might be the case, I felt that the boys (Masaki isn't a main) really had a firm, crisp, bond, being   much better than the usual slice of life anime- with the fact of being super adorable!\\nBecause of the anime being called You and me in English, (after being such a slowpoke) when I watched the anime again this gave me a thought of what ever affects you in the group affects everyone else too, giving me the idea of  that whatever moments you go through, all of them will embrace the happiness and pain with you. This gave me the reason of thinking that KB really is a lovely heartwarming show that any human being could watch anytime, making you laugh or cry you'll be feel merry at any moment you watch the anime. I couldn't help but realize that I smiled at every episode, also resulting in  a few tears of happiness too. I could re watch Kimi to Boku almost anytime, being a favorite that won't be scraped off my list anytime soon!\\nKimi to Boku really is a beautiful yet simple story, with a better friendship like nothing else.

Or just being emotional?\\nAll I know is that Kimi to Boku really makes me feel happy.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2dbe55bc0aad630e6f470238508ef855'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Edited from my previous review, with a few additions.\\nWhat show doesn’t start off slow nowadays only for it to actually become better overtime? Unfortunately many anime viewers are impatient and if they don’t like what they see on episode 1 it’s dropped from their viewing schedule.  A good example for this would be the Fall 2011 series “Kimi to Boku”. It had to deal with the consistent comments of “OMG TEH GAY DO NOT WANT (an exaggeration but still..) and “It’s boring”. Now i can talk in depth about the latter criticism. As a hard-core slice of life fan, even i had the urge\\nto call KtB “boring” after the first two episodes. It was almost too realistic: a group of high school boys doing what high school boys usually do. No mechas, no ecchi, no outlandish premise but an everyday look at a regular group of friends. For most people this is just too mundane to give a watch but if you’re open to a slice of life series or this series is your first slice of life experience then watch till episode 3 and then you can drop this series if it still bores you. The hero who saves the show from total boredom and who also breaths life into these group of mundane characters is the boy with the straw-colored hair: Chizuru Tachibana. Chizuru brings more energy to the show than the entire cast combined and it takes a bit to get used to his personality especially in contrast to the more easy-going twins Yuuta and Yuuki, effeminate Shun, and Kaname the typical megane character. But after a while, the show becomes so much better: the cast really works well together, the stories are more heart-warming and the music works really well at times. At times i want to call Chizuru a walking plot device but his own personality gives the show life which spreads to the other main characters in due time. The stories are very heart-warming and you may think “Oh, wow i did that too!”. It’s a series about high schoolers, so expect to relate to one of more of the stories presented in this series.\\nWhat really surprised me had nothing to do with the anime itself but the company involved with the production of it. If you were to tell me a year ago that J.C. Staff was going to animate a slice of life series with an all male-cast, i’d laugh at you. J.C. Staff is the biggest abuser of the tsundere anime character and the mascot promoting such characters (Rie Kugimiya) and most of their works are criticized for being unfaithful to the original source, bad pacing or sub-par animation.  Most of their series are about tsunderes or moe characters with little or no originality (tell me Hidan no Aria doesn’t resemble Shakugan no Shana?) and i was really fearing for the worst with news of this adaptation.\\nLuckily it seems that my fears were quickly dashed and i commend J.C. Staff for doing a great job with this series even if it’s obvious they didn’t really put a lot of effort into it: the production values aren't anything special, the occasional CG sakura petals notwithstanding, and the character designs take a bit to get use to but it's nothing horrendous of the sort.\\nI really love the voice acting in this series. Yuuta and Yuuki’s voices are so scary similar you actually think they are voiced by actual twins but in reality kudos goes to Kouki Uchiyama (Yuuta) and Ryohei Kimura (Yuuki) for doing a splendid job. Of course the real star is Miyu Irino as the spunky Chizuru, balancing a tight line from being too dull and too annoying. Other notables are Toshiyuki Toyonaga (Shun, also Flit from Gundam AGE and Mikado from Durarara!!) and Yuuki Ono (Kaname, many minor roles).  The insert songs used in the series are also timed perfectly in most cases, and surprisingly the singer of those songs is a guy! But the real treat for me is the OP/ED: I really liked the cheerfulness of the OP with contrast with the more reminiscent feel of the ED.\\nTo wrap it up, Kimi to Boku was a sweet surprise that managed to pull itself out of the weak first two episodes to become a great watch for us slice of life fans and a good watch to anyone willing to give this show a chance.\\n2011 was the year to not judge a book by its cover, and Kimi to Boku is one of the many examples of that rule.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '73e8fafba187cd9310af857f636ac495'}>,\n",

If I were to choose between super girly themed anime; I′d rather choose one like Kimi to Boku. In this time of the year, you rarely find an anime like Kimi to Boku, surely you can find some anime whose story are about childhood friends, but most of them are about a boy - girl childhood friendship who becomes a couple afterwards—those kind\\nof anime are rather common to us now.\\nYou could say that Kimi to Boku doesn′t have a plot or storyline; My conclusion is that the writer, wants us not to focus on a certain story, but on how they will develop their friendship and relationship to each other—how they strengthen their bonds and how they spend their spare times.\\nStory;;\\n4 males, Kaname, Yuki, Yuta and Shun, who were friends since their early childhood, are still friends until now that they′re in their Highschool year. You rarely see a relationship and bond between males to be that strong. Mostly, women are the ones who are like that; but as I said, the 4 males are like that. They do what normal friends would do—eat together and go home together. One day, a new half Japanese transfer student was sent in their class; what trouble would this transfer student give them? Not realizing it, he became one of them, Tachibana Chizuru.\\nArt;;\\nThough the art is not much what you can say much of an awesome art, it′s still acknowledge-able; surely it would, otherwise, her art wouldn′t be turned animated, would it?\\nSound;;\\nNothing much to say about the BGM′s, OP′s and ED′s. But yes, it still needs to be criticized. There′s nothing wrong or unpleasant about the sounds and musics in the anime. Every scene that is strong has some sounds that are matched and you can really feel what it is. Felling at ease by the warm melodic sounds.\\nCharacter;;\\nI′d say that all the characters are great the way they are now; nothing needs to changed. Their looks are accurate and matched from their traits and personalities. Like Shun, he is a bit of a shy type, she is like a girl, so she is a little petite. To much more look like a girl.\\nEnjoyment;;\\nI′ve really enjoyed the Kimi to Boku, although I haven′t finished it yet.

I first started watching this anime because my friend showed it to me. It was funny and you couldn't really feel the slice of life element in it. The producers love throwing in random scenes of just cats in the middle of everything. They'll be talking and then it's just a cat stretching. This anime is light-hearted and something you can laugh with your friends about. It's not the usual dark\\nand gloomy ending of the female mc dying or leaving.\\nStory- It doesn't really have that much of a story line. You have to watch it all the way though to understand some things but usually it's just Yukki and Yuta annoying Kaname and Shun trying to calm him down and Chizuru just acting like an idiot.\\nArt- It's pretty good I feel like they put lots of thought into the cats lol\\nSound- They have nice soundtracks especially when they try to add in the slice of life element to it.\\nCharacter- I love the characters. Yukki and Yuta are my favorite because of the nonchalant attitude and how when it's just them two together you can really see the contrast between them. There's little to no character development it's almost the same the whole way through.\\nOverall- I liked it.

Since the first episode I was hooked on this anime because of the simplicity of the image. Kimi To Boku for me is like a breeze from the sea very calm and quiet.\\nStory: 9\\nThe story involves four friends, two twins (Yuuki and Yuuto), Shun that looks like a girl (usually there are a lot of jokes about it) and Kaname who has a passion for older women. There are some romance between new characters. And later Chizuru (the blond) joins\\nthe group.There isnt  difficult to follow and has an addictive storyline. Perhaps I have become a junkie for poetry and for moments that depict friendship in this group that comes from childhood.\\nArt: 8\\nArt is not anything fancy, I think what makes it special is its peaceful landscapes.\\nSound: 8\\nThe song is really calm and everytime I hear the opening (Bye Bye「バイバイ」 by 7!!) and the finishing(Miku Sawai- Nakimushi) I started to dream  and thing in the little suprises that anime brings.\\nCharacter: 9\\nThe drawings are not very strict. I think their personalities complement each other on the group.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI see this anime in a couple of days.

Kimi to boku have everything humor, drama, romance and friendship.\\nOverall:9\\nIf you have a group of friends maybe you will now what I am talking about Kimi to boku gives us how much we appreciate our friends and the power that friendship can have.

Something they will expand in more detail with in S2.\\nKimi to Boku just has this \"Feel Good\" factor about it, Top that off with great visual style, characters, And even a really good OP and a superb ED theme this series is the complete package for any fans of School Drama/Slice Of Life, Kimi to Boku does everything right and is a perfect example how a series like this should be executed.\\nWhich brings me to my 2 Negative views for Kimi to Boku. Firstly i sensed a S2 even before i checked there was one, During the whole series at points things felt left back or untouched which without a S2 They would of expanded a bit, At times this shows and you do feel parts are a big dragged out or the heavy reliance on the Character interactions to keep some episodes progressing without much in the story.\\nLast negative is about one character, Chizuru, He is the new guy to the group, And thus not knowing any of them in their past as the other 4 have known each other since Kindergarden, He acts at parts as the viewer, Asking questions and being filled in with information of their past. That part i enjoyed, But his whole personality and the way he conducts himself in this series is quite annoying, I know that part of wanting to be the \"centre of attention\" is being loud, obnoxious and someone who wants to always been heard or seen on screen, which is the case for Chizuru, but  i just didn\\'t seeing that side and at points it just got on my nervers.\\nOverall, A fantastic series which i hope as i have pointed out, expand some of the parts and storylines they left hanging from S1, This series is the benchmark for a good and well balanced Slice Of Life, I would highly recommend this series.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '23ef67e0ae2744caa7e3d30525b3d0e4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"You and Me is an anime that I really enjoyed. It was hilarious and had me laughing throughout. For me, it's one of those anime's that I want to watch again and again. It had a simple premise that was executed well. Really well.\\nStory\\nThe story for You and Me is simplistic. Why? Because it's a coming of age story about 4 (5 later on) friends who have known each other since kindergarten. I feel that the story is told well because it shows us how they went from being really young and naive to old (not really old, only when they're teens) and mature. The\\nstory was not unique, but predictable. I do not find this a flaw for the story since I really enjoyed it nonetheless. You might find this a major flaw, but I personally don't. The comedy in the anime was really well done. I thought the bond between the characters helped with the comedy aspect of the story because it shows how close they really are. However, I have one flaw with the story. Well, not really focusing on the story overall but with the first episode. The first episode did not set good first impressions for me. I thought it was slow, dull, and boring. I thought that it would be an anime I would just forget and never watch ever again. I didn't even think I would complete the anime. Luckily, the episodes after episode 1 made up for that, so that's a really good thing. Overall, I really enjoyed the story of this anime. It had a rocky start, but it makes up with the future episodes.\\nCharacters\\nI am not going to go over every single character and give my opinion on them. Instead, I'm going to go over the characters as a whole. All the characters in the anime were well-rounded. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. For me, it's your typical group of five guys: the smart one, the joyful one, the popular (or semi-popular in this case) one, the hyper one, and the silent yet funny one. This group to me is in no way a flaw for the characters. All of these characters are relatable in some way, which is a really huge plus for me. The supporting characters were great because they all helped the group in one way or another. I don't think there is an antagonist of any kind in the story. Then again, it's not that type of anime where you'll find a bad guy since it mainly focuses on our main five. Overall, the characters, both main and supporting, were great. All of them were well-rounded and really great characters.\\nArt\\nThe style of this anime is realistic. Obviously, because it's slice of life. The art and animation in this anime were fantastic. But, then again, all of the anime I've watched so far had really great art and animation. That applies to this anime. There is not a moment in this anime where I thought that the art and animation was bad. This type of art style really fit the story because, well, what other kind of art style would it be? Well, actually a couple, but the realistic style fits it perfectly. There were no moments where I thought that the animation was breathtaking or remarkable. This is not a flaw because it isn't that type of anime. It just isn't, in my eyes. I am not sure if this is really a flaw for the anime, but I'm having a hard time trying to find the difference between the twins in the story. Yeah, that might sound really stupid, but it just was. It's understandable though because, well, they're twins. Clothing color was the only way they can get a difference between the two. Overall, I like the art and animation for this anime. There were no breathtaking moments in art and animation, but for me, it's okay for an anime like this.\\nSound\\nI felt that the sound for the characters were very good. All of them sounded appropriate for the character presented. The background music for this anime helped make a scene enjoyable if it's happy and gloomy when it's sad. Not really really sad, just sad. I really liked the intro and ending songs, but it's not something I'll remember forever. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, but it's just something that you won't remember for the rest of your life. It's not that memorable. Overall, I thought that the sound for this anime was very good.\\nEnjoyment/Conclusion\\nDid I enjoy this anime? Yes. A lot. Like, a lot a lot. This anime had me laughing throughout. I think that other people will like this anime unless you're not into this type of anime. If you do not like comedy or coming of age stories, then I think this anime is not for you. If I showed this to a person that does not like anime, I honestly think they'll have mixed feelings about it at first because of the first episode. However, once they watch the other episodes, I think they'll really like it. I would re-watch this anime just because it was really funny. Not only specific episodes, but the entire series. Even the first episode. I personally do not like bad starts, but that's just me. You'll probably like the first episode. I didn't, so, yeah. Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and I'll recommend it to anyone, fan of anime or not a fan of anime. This is a really memorable anime that I will remember for quite a while.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a4c0c112853607d1284a3d08d1b791ac'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge Slice of Life fan. Perhaps I'm missing some subtle art, but they usually just seem so boring to me. But I try to give everything a fair try.\\nIn a lot of ways, Kimi To Boku was exactly what I expected it to be. The characters were unoriginal tropes who didn't defy their blueprint very often, if at all. I watched both seasons, but it was slow going. The animation budget seemed to be lacking. The character designs were kind of bland, and though there was a ton of dialogue in this show, they often\\nfocused on things that were much cheaper to animate while the speaking character was offscreen.\\nThat said, there were a few things I did really enjoy. I wasn't too caught up with most of the side characters, but there were some really sweet moments, and there was something in every single episode that made me laugh. This show had a really subtle, dry sense of humor that I loved. The music was nice also, but it wasn't anything that really stuck out.\\nThough the characters were all shameless stereotypes, I did enjoy how they were portrayed. I love their portrayal of Yuki and Yuta. Though they're identical, I never had any trouble telling them apart, and they made a point of showcasing differences in their personalities from the very first episode, which just isn't something I usually see with identical twins. It was nice to see the writers thinking outisde the box a little. Yuki and Yuta clearly aren't used to being mistaken for each other. The childhood friends aspect of this show was done very subtly as well. Little things like how well they knew each other's personality quirks and how comfortable the boys were in each other's homes went a long way. I appreciate that they didn't have to make it loud or forced. It was refreshing.\\nSo if you're a Slice of Life fan, I'd definitely recommend this show.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Kimi to Boku. A story about five friends who have a heck of a fun time (maybe not for Kaname) and we see their relationships and everyday life pan out. At first I didn't really know how good or bad this anime was going to be, but after watching the first few episodes, I was hooked and wanted to watch more.\\nStory: 9\\nThe story follows the life of the five main characters, and with it the usual and unusual events that unfold. This show doesn't have too much of a deep plot, as it is a slice of life, but we get to see many different\\nthings happen and it is a joy to watch if you like that. There was more comedy than I originally expected, which was great as I particularly like the way it is done in this show. It is a very 'light' show and is very relaxing, and for me is certainly a 'feel good' anime.\\nArt: 8\\nI found the art in this show was nothing spectacular, but it was that which made it great. The simplistic design complements the general feel of the show, and it's very easy on the eyes. A very enjoyable feature in this anime that you art lovers will like is that occasionally at certain scenes (usually near the end of the episode) the screen will pause and fade into a watercolour version of that frame. These pictures are also used in the ending, which is a pleasure to watch. One thing though, what's with all the random cats?! I found it strange how cats are shown as some kind of transition between a lot of the scenes. Otherwise, fantastic art.\\nSound: 9\\nKimi to Boku. has some of the best background tracks I've ever heard in anime. There's sweet melodies for flashbacks, funky music for comedic moments and much more. These are all played at just the right moment to create a very 'alive' show that keeps you mesmerised. The opening and ending have great music, and special mention goes to the intro at the start of each episode, which I'm sure many people jump in glee to when they hear it. Each of the voice actors have very unique voices, which both contrast and complement each other. We have the Asaba twins and their monotonic (and often synchronised) speech, Shun and his quite feminine voice, Kaname who's quite brash and loud, and of course Chizuru who is very lively and childish.\\nCharacter: 9\\nEvery one of the characters have a unique personality which, like their voices, contrast each other and complement each other to make a great show. The show takes turns to focus on each of the characters' lives, with quite a few flashbacks and this generates a deep background and depth for each of them. We get to see relationships develop and how their personality changes, and I think this gives the show has a massive amount of depth to each of the main characters.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nWhen watching this anime, I really enjoyed myself and found myself smiling and laughing along with the characters. I can really relate to some of them, and just the general easy going theme in this show makes it really great to watch. I'd recommend watching this if you're looking for something relaxing, funny, and all in all very enjoyable to watch. This is definitely a 'feel good' anime, and if you are feeling a bit down, just watch some of this and I can guarantee that you will feel better in no time.\\nOverall: 9\\nKimi to Boku. is maybe not the show for everyone, but if you like your slice of life, this is a must watch. It is a great show to escape to, if you just want to get away from reality for 24 minutes and indulge in the antics of the five friends.\\nThanks for reading, and if you have chosen to watch this I hope you enjoy it!

Having such a reminescence of the past and how it led to their friendship being so strong that it became some kind of love hate relationship is actually endearing.\\nThis show focuses on how one is aging among a group of friends : having to deal with love of course is one aspect of how one may loose sight of friendship , hopefully this anime while having its touchy moments remains a funny one.\\nThis show is to watch if you are need of bromance without having the shonen ai vibe.\\nSo much for the sum up beyond this point there will be spoilers and a deeper analysis of the show.\\nStory 8/10 :\\nThe story while not having a main focus or proper ending when it comes to season 1 is actually better than most slice of life anime. As it does not intend to focus on a particuliar goal , the anime aims at taking the viewer through a journey of human relationships through a teenager\\'s eyes. Having for instant Kaname falling in love for his kindergarten teacher is interesting as it is not presented in the ecchi way it could/would have been in other slice of life. Indeed Kaname has a thing for mature women and is something that some young people may face during high school. Yet here it appears lighter , while Kaname\\'s love or admiration for Azuma seems genuine it does not takes the story to a gloomy and dramatic ending as it is during real youth:  romance stays in one part of our mind and well school just passes by without much time and so does our crush.\\nKaname is one exemple but throughout season 1 every episode had its load of cute sidestories that many slice of life lack today although it allows to do some character development. Actually having such a mechanism is really efficient when it comes to the Yuuki and Yuta pair as the differences between the character design are really close to none : having only a different haircut and hair color. Thanks to character development one may finally differentiate the two twins and this really shows how the anime succeeded in the way it approached storytelling : Yuuki and Yuta have different traits and behavior! Thus it creates a gap between generic anime having many character design but in the end boring characters themselves. This is where this show is on par with Non non biyori : having characters that shine through their habits , the way they talk or interact with others rather than only by the look.\\nWatching such anime makes a good day , although some stories seem boring when thoroughly looked at , one may only enjoy the Nichijou-esque aspect of this anime : while not being as fast paced as Nichijou the same ridiculous situations and jokes are there. In that regard Kimi to Boku is more like Lucky Star. However where the least did not venture Kimi to Boku went silently in : slight hints of romance between characters has a sweet taste that makes us craving more in the end of season one. Indeed as goofy as they may be each characters has its own romantic slight development. With it , Chizuru and Mary is such a sweet sailing ship between Tsunderes that can only be encouraged. Why so? Because Chizuru is acting like many teenagers during their first love : not being really sure about how they feel about the person they are longing for. This love that seems really hard to attain and to declare makes it very pure : having Chizuru blushing is really soothing.\\nIn the end the only issue with the story is that it did not have a proper closure but i\\'m hoping that the second season will fix that.\\nCharacter 8/10 :\\nThanks to the story aspect of this anime the characters are shining!\\nKaname : The romance aspect with mature women is actually interesting but not developed enough as the anime is only 13 episodes short. Of course Kaname is the archetype of the \"megane\" being good at studying and serious in every circumstances : he still has a soft spot by not relying much on others although in the end of the day his pals are always there to support him.\\nShun : Good lord this character is your general shota but the way he acts is very cute. Would hug anyday! Beside that, it is quite disappointing that his character was not further exposed during the anime ; although the episode with his little brother was a good beginning.\\nYuta : Is a character that many will identify with during youth. He is fully questionning his existence while remaining stoic : a stance that many teenagers adopt nowdays and only lose when in contact with a loved one. While his character is not glommy he appears as the closest to how many have felt while being a teenager : not really liking things and not knowing what to do with their life , solely enjoying the present with their friends.\\nYuuki : Excellent goofer. His stoic attitude ,which appears to run in the family as seen with his elder brother Yuta, is completely balanced by the fact that his line are killers : every joke made landed good. While not being hilarious he is really a talented and handsome boy yet insufferably lazy and apathetic. Him and his brother are like the Ying and the Yang.\\nChizuru : At first his chaacter may seem annoying as he is mostly clingy however as the episodes go by another aspect of his personality unveils : he is a sucker for cuteness and romance. Jokes between him and Shun are actually really interesting as it may show that teens are easily conflicted about love and the matter of genre : suggesting many times that Chizuru would date Shun was an interesting concept that I would have loved to see expanded. It is a fact that many during this age are questionning their sexuality and yet not many anime seem to face this topic while being serious and not overkilling it with sex jokes or ecchiness. Nevertheless another aspect which is romance and not showing the soft spots appears throughout Chizuru\\'s story: always wanting to cheer people up despite being sorrowful about losing to another one his love. Here\\'s another gem of this anime not having jealousy coming into acount but just personal feeling of not being good enough or not being the one : many anime focus on jealousy when young people often feel not fit for dating someone rather than jealous of good-looking people.\\nSide characters are also really good as they always allow characters to develop or express their feelings.\\nArtwork 7/10 :\\nWhile not being amazing it does the job , it has the singularity of including cats every once in while making a parallel between the characters interactions and the way cats actually interact with each others : having this Nichijou feeling of transitions being randomly sweet. The art seems dated as the anime is back from 2011 , still it would be average or a bit below for this era as Nichijou is also from 2011 : not having the mouths animated for exemple.\\nOST ,EP,ED and Seiyuu 6/10:\\nNow the OP and ED are good but are not astonishing however the seiyuus are really good at doing their job conveying feelings and having speech pattern distinct enough to be able to differentiate the two twins. However there is a true lack of OST that would allow this show to go from a very good slice of life to a memorable one.\\nConclusion 7,25/10:\\nI made the mean of all the scores and obtained 7,25/10 which appears to reflect perfectly how this show felt : in for characters interactions and a bit of story but not much to expect when it comes to length , artwork or design. This slice of life is far above from average and everyone looking to smile a bit should watch this anime. Nevertheless one should not expect much by the ending of it. I highly recommend watching this anime to ease the pace between two shonen or AAA animes!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9b2a607a724efb166e1cabc57d8d67fb'}>,\n",

I don't know if it would speak to anybody, maybe some people wouldn't like it even if they gave it a fair chance, but the charm isn't obvious, it doesn't jump at you as soon as you start watching it - you find the charm as you connect to it. For me that happened in episode 2, but I would understand if for others that would be different.\\nI don't like dividing my review to story, art, blah blah, I'll just explain.\\nThe story, characters, and directory, are magically down to earth and\\nsoft. If you watch it expecting it to be good in the manners most anime go by, it'd be slow and boring, but these turn out to be beautiful in this anime when you just go with it. I always love anime where things are very down to earth and minimal, because then the anime feels alive, it feels like it's breathing, and when a beautiful moment comes, it truly speaks loud even though it's conveyed quietly. It feels more like real life and that's really beautiful, it makes it so I get actually surprised when things happen, I get much more connected to things because they speak to me directly, which doesn't happen a lot with other anime because there I expect to find some twist or surprise - and this quiet way is beautiful. The characters seem basic, but seeing them experience more and more things makes you start to understand them more and they start being important to you - and they're also not at all basic types lie they seemed at first sight. The comedy is hilarious, absolutely brilliant, and again, special and down to earth, which makes it a lot funnier to me. I laughed out loud a lot, I have a lot of pictures and recorded moment from the anime because they made me laugh so much, the comedy is very original and clever, and it's super funny. The little senimental stories they tell through the anime always really touch my heart, as they just feel so real, and they end up both making me adore the characters, and get a beauiful modest vibe, which I'm happy to be reminded of, I forget that modest things can bring me the most happiness a lot. I also think the author is very smart, this anime gave me insights to all sorts of things, for example the way Shun's caring and soft attitude often gets people who are precieved as angry and mean by others to open up to him. It's true that mean people are usually people who are having a hard time, and it's also true that we all often don't act like Shun but more like what we always do when somebody is being mean to us, and I'm happy to be reminded of this insight this way, I hope I could be more like Shun.\\nThe music is 12/10, it's incredible, I don't know if I've seen an anime that nailed their music managment this well before. Every soundtrack is true quality content, each song is beautiful and stylish and brings a nuanced mood with it. Whoever was responsible for the music has an amazing ear. The OST tracks end up feeling really sentimental as they're played over more and more sentimental moments in the show.\\nTo be honest, I don't know what made this show so beautiful - but I didn't want it to be over (I'm talking about season 2 as well) and I'm super thankful that I happened to stumble upon it so many years after its release. I hope by this review I could maybe spread it even to one more person. It conveyed beautiful slice of life messages and feelings to me, it was both a 20/10 experience getting to love this cast of characters and know about more of their experiences, and to get the message of the author, to understand how I shouldn't forget that making my life simple can be the best thing sometimes.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '83a8dec2946acf8dc06efb7f4d8791c2'}>,\n",

Seriously, don\\'t.\\nNow, I was looking for a boring slice-of-life anime to watch as I\\'ve been watching a lot of action and adventure anime, and because I am the way I am, I needed something boring to calm me down. So, Kimi To Boku was exactly what I was looking for. I really can\\'t fault it because this story truly is boring, slice-of-life anime about school boys. I just didn\\'t realize how boring it would be.\\nSo the story... I think it was good! Sure, nothing big really happened at all, but some small things did happen\\nand that made the story go forward. Though, a certain character started to ruin the story for me, in the end, I really enjoyed the story.\\nThe art style of this anime is unique, at least to me it is. I haven\\'t watched a lot of anime in my life, but I\\'ve never come across art like this - not to say that it\\'s bad. Sure, I like it more when there are a lot more details etc, but this art style fit perfectly to the story.\\nThe music was great in this one, though it did take me like 5 episodes to start liking the opening and ending.\\nNow, the characters.... The main five boys? I liked them a lot. Sure, Kaname was super weird with his crushes and how he didn\\'t fit the normal \"i have eyeglasses so i\\'m the preppy nerd boy of the group\" trope, but there weren\\'t any times when I would hate him. The Asaba twins were even better! It was refreshing to see identical twins written like this in an anime. And while I did like Shun a lot, sometimes his innocence went overboard and surely no one would be that obvious. Chizuru was the energetic person the boys needed in their group, but his personality was bit all over the place...\\nMasaki gets her own paragraph because boy.... I. Did. Not. Like. Her. At. All.

Sure, she did get a little nicer towards the boys in the end, but man, I always sighed so much whenever she was on screen. Plus, her relationship with Shun seemed more like a brother and a sister, than any sort of romantic type. I truly hoped that she would be better in the second season, but from what I\\'ve heard...\\nBut even through all that, I did enjoy the show. It definitely was what I was looking for.

This is my first review so forgive me if it is a bit lacking or too wordy.\\nA bit of a side note: I am not a huge fan of this genre but I tried to write this in a way that I feel and didn\\'t want to sugarcoat anything in fear it\\'ll lose a touch of being \"me\"\\nStarting with the story: 6\\nThe story in Kimi to Boku is fairly average with nothing to really make it stand out from all the other slice of life high school comedies. However, despite being a genre that\\'s been seen a million times over, still managed to\\nkeep itself from coming off as stale. Despite being nothing exceptional, I can\\'t help but feel the execution was still done well enough to keep it if not enjoyable, very slightly above average.\\nThe art: 7\\nIn my opinion, it doesn\\'t have the greatest art but it does have an art style that I very much enjoy with a very bright and mellow color palette that reflects the feel and theme of the show. I felt it was well done.\\nSound: 6\\nThe op in wasn\\'t the most memorable op and neither was the ending but despite that, I did enjoy it and also felt it matched the tone of the anime very well.

The soundtrack used in the anime was not very exceptional but followed all the right ques to keep it from clashing with the story telling which makes me feel kind of said there wasn\\'t a much more fleshed out story to led the soundtrack shine more...\\nCharacters: 5\\nMany of the characters laid out in the anime were very... unexceptional. Most of them had nothing to really keep them memorable or make me \"fall in love (no homo)\" with them. The cast felt rather bland with your typical blonde transfer student that also happens to be a childhood friend of one of the cast members, Megane-kun who is that smart class president type who is engrossed in his books and adds a sense of reason and stability in a group of seemingly misfits. The lazy character who is actually fairly observant and keen when he wants to be but in the end, is very lazy.. etc etc. The characters felt rather bland which makes \"sense\" for a slice of life high school comedy show but I felt there could have been a bit more to define the characters from falling into tropes.\\nEnjoyment: 6\\nThe show, in my opinion, was without a doubt enjoyable with a slightly above average story, good art, a fairly good soundtrack and direction that felt a bit wasted with the average story, characters that didn\\'t seem too special but in many respects, average. I didn\\'t find myself craving the next episode as I listened to the ED but I also did not find myself wanting to take a break or drop it while watching so I would rate it as \"alright\"\\nOverall: 6\\nA bit of a note, these types of shows (Slice of life high school comedy shows) often do not seem special to me and often get rated a 4 or a 5 depending on how bland and generic it can seem but I felt this Kimi to Boku was still very much enjoyable with a good art, average story w/ sound, and a very average cast.

Its a slice of life type of anime about 5 guys and their friendship and their daily lives in high school. Nothing dramatic happens, no villains or sudden twists, but somehow the story still manages to draw you in with every episode. If you need a break at the end of a long day, this anime is just the thing to put a smile on your face and make you feel all fuzzy inside.\\nStory: Very laidback pace, with every episode either being told\\nfrom a certain character's perspective (so you can hear his thoughts) or just general third-person perspective. The overarching theme is about friendship, as 4 of the guys have been friends since kindergarten, while the 5th guy just transferred and joins them. The story deals with their daily lives, the small conflicts and events that happen in everyday high school life (clubs, sibling fights, relationship stuff, admiration for a senior etc). The charm of this anime is how it is subtly it manages to make you think and reflect on your own life (if you're out of high school, this is gonna make you miss those days a lot!), and make every moment seem special :)\\nArt: Simple and clean, lots of pastels. Similar in style to Natsume Yuujinchou, which makes me love it even more. My favourite thing is how they have lots of CATS! The cats are sort of a representation of the 5 guys (and occasionally other characters) and are completely adorable and hilarious!\\nSound: Love the ending songs of both seasons, and the background tracks, especially in season 1, are really good. Very chilled laidback songs, a bit like Corinne Bailey Rae songs (look her up on Youtube, she's great), that make you feel like you're lying in the warm sunlight on a spring day with a gentle breeze.\\nCharacter: Absolutely loved the boys, each with their own unique personality.  Kaname as the typical smart aleck with glasses and is in the Student Council, but surprisingly hot tempered and gets bullied by the twins a lot. The good looking twins, both have different personalities, and are charming in different ways. They always crack me up with their jokes! Shun is always mistaken as a girl, and is always kind and gentle. Chizuru is the loudest and most childish one, but is a sweetie when it comes to love :) each character are given their moments to shine, and every episode peels a layer off to reveal more about the characters, and keeps you coming back for more.\\nOverall, you'll be smiling a lot, and occasionally laughing out loud, while watching this anime.

There\\'s more episodes for me to watch? Mendoukusaii!!\" but Kimi To Boku is definitely NOT one of those.\\nSimply said, the story is not too complex that it becomes a turn off, but not too simple that would make you wonder, \"what the hell were the producers thinking?\"\\nThe climax might not be about Alien Invasions or such, but it\\'s quite interesting. We follow the development of\\n5 best friends as they journey through High School, which has it\\'s ups and downs. What\\'s particularly interesting is Chizuru, who only joined the group whereas the other 4 have been the best of friends since kindergarten. In this adventure through adolescence, they experience everything. Funny moments, love, dating, conflict, confusion, etc. What\\'s more, these 5 friends are very cheerful and have personalities of their own, making the exchange between the 5 very refreshing and entertaining. I AM NOT LYING WHEN I SAY, THIS ANIME IS ENTERTAINING. Whether you watch it at night or during daytime, you\\'ll probably end up smiling and say, \"I need to watch the next episode!\"\\nWith many things that keeps you on the edge of the seat, like the question, who will Masaki AKA Mary-chan, end up with? Chizuru or Shun? Will Yuuki ever get interested in anything? Will Yuuta seal his relationship? Will Kaname\\'s interest in older women turn into a possibility? Question that can only be answered by watching the series.\\nART - 10/10\\nNot much to say, other than the fact that the way the characters and overall the anime is drawn to perfectly suit with the theme.\\nA quote from the series, said by Azuma-sensei, \"I thought growing older would turn me into an adult. I believed I\\'d find work, get married, and become an adult. But none of those things have happened. Even though I\\'ve grown older, I feel like nothing\\'s changed.\"\\nThe art in this anime completely depicts youth and shows the innocence and happiness of the 5 friends as they journey through high school. The colours are refreshing and cool, making the anime feel calm, but not at all dull. Even from the first scene where Shun was seen under a Sakura tree, the beauty of the scene just highlights his innocence and gives the anime the first impression that it is probably gonna revolve around the same premise. The character designs are not too forcefully drawn, making the teen-aura resonate throughout the whole series.\\nSOUND - 10/10\\nThe background music, the sound effects like the rustling of the leaves being slowly blown by the breeze, the indistinct chatter in the background resembling a high school in reality, it\\'s all just too perfect to describe.\\nAgain, I\\'m talking based on context. Obviously the sound and music isn\\'t as high-end as anime like Your lie in April, but it suits the Anime\\'s desire to keep the setting calm and soothing.\\nThe opening and closing themes are definitely one of the favourite things in this anime, as it is so rejuvenating and brings back your personal memories in your high school, and also hints the strong bond between the 5 friends.\\nOverall, it suits the anime very well, kudos to the people in charge.\\nCHARACTER - 10/10\\nPERFECT, MEMORABLE, INTERESTING, AND REALISTIC.\\nThere are 4 words to sum up the character development. Overall, it was nice to see that the character development wasn\\'t too forced or rushed, and whenever it was necessary, some backstory and exposition through flashbacks showed how the 4 friends (excluding chizuru, since he\\'s new) have been close all these years, and also showed natural development that made us say, \"wow, they\\'re really close.\"\\nIt didnt feel too forced through unnecessary emphasis and obvious statements, but the development was good enough for anyone watching to buy the fact that these friends were close to the point that they would do anything together. To describe how the main characters are;\\nCHIZURU - PLAYFUL, THE \"BAKA\" OF THE GROUP, FRIENDLY and LOYAL, his main trait is his carefree attitude that only wants to have fun, making him earn the nickname, \"monkey\"\\nSHUN - KAWAII, INNOCENT, LOVES THE GROUP A LOT, and CARING, his main trait is that he is very polite and to certain degree quite feminine, making him confused as being a girl by many.\\nYUUKI - OTAKU, TALENTED, PLAYFUL, LAZY, his main trait that he doesn\\'t bother himself with anything that doesnt make him happy. That\\'s why he can be very irresponsible and only cares about hanging out with the group or reading manga, eventhough he is VERY talented in sports like basketball. This is what makes him known as the \"lazy younger twin\".\\nYUUTA - RESPONSIBLE, KIND, WELL MANNERED, TALENTED, his main trait is that he will always carry out what is required of him to his fullest extent, and his main priority in life is to make his younger twin, yuuki, be able to live happily, all while being happy himself. This is what makes him known as the \"responsible older twin\"\\nKANAME - SMART, WELL DRESSED, WELL MANNERED, SHY, his main trait is that he always tries to maintain the \"matured\" look eventhough deep inside, the kid in him is still alive. This is why he is always picked on by Yuuki and Chizuru, because his anger is amusing and funny to watch.\\nENJOYMENT - 9/10\\nI am positive that even if you are not a fan of the slice of life genre, you will still enjoy this anime, even if it\\'s not definitely your favourite anime.\\nThis Anime has so much to offer. Laughs, smiles, and occasionally some cringes (due to Chizuru\\'s funny antics) and you will not realize as time flies by, you\\'re already done with the whole series and you kinda wish you were among the 5 friends because their adventure was just so amusing.\\nOVERALL - 9/10\\nIn a nutshell, you will find that this anime has quite a lot to offer and you will not get bored. Maybe some scenes are quite cliche, but overall, this is compensated by the thrilling adventure that these 5 teens go through, and you\\'ll definitely laugh, smile and cry along with them!\\nGo on! Give this Anime a try and add it to your watchlist now!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd301f957a970e08f053a98ed084f11f6'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I'm personally not a fan of shows that have no plot whatsoever; but I really feel like Kimi to Boku changed that. I was impressed within the first episode, and after that, I simply fell in love.\\nThe first season did take me a little longer to finish, I was entertained throughout my time watching it. There were times where I was sometimes bored with the episodes, but overall, I was in love.\\nWhen I found out that the second season was coming out in the spring of 2012, I was very excited because I had just recently finished the first season around that time; and\\nnow that I'm almost completed with the second season (which has taken me so long to watch as I've been busy with other anime), I'm still impressed.\\nThe art was beautiful, the characters (especially the twins), had their own personalities that you could easily enjoy; and I think the best part was that their personalities easily went with each other's. There will be times where the episodes feel so long, but there are also times where the episodes get so interesting that they just fly by and you don't even notice it's over until the ending theme!\\nAnyway, rating time!\\nSTORY: Overall, the story would have to be a 6. The anime itself really has no plot; as it's about five high school boys who are growing up, and not only are they growing up, but their friendship is growing also. It shows the daily lives of what some high school students do and the fun adventures that they all get to have. Either way; if you're one of those people who are interested in anime that are just about life in general; then you should definitely watch this show.\\nART: The art, I would have to give a 6 as well. When I first started watching this series, I was not used to the art at all. I have to admit though, after watching a couple of episodes, I loved the art. It's unique, it's beautiful, it's wonderful, and I just enjoyed it! I think the art really goes with the anime, and I feel like maybe you would agree if you watched it yourself (if you haven't, that is).\\nSOUND: Usually, I skip the opening theme and the ending themes, but wow, I was amazed by how well the songs fit with the anime itself. I felt like it really described it, and it definitely made me happy to hear it. I never skipped the opening/ending songs, and I'm so happy I did. They were catchy, and I just love how soft and cheery it all sounds! For other sounds; they were great!\\nCHARACTERS: As mentioned before, all of the characters have different personalities (though most characters have different personalities, correct?). As the anime progresses, it explains how they have been going to school together since kindergarten, and now they're in high school. Yuki and Yuta, the twins, may look alike, but they're personalities were sort of different. Shun's personality, I felt really made their friendship grow better, and I'm sure without Shun, things would be way different. Kaname, on the other hand, was definitely a character that I did not like at first, but as I continued to watch, I fell in love with his character. He may be harsh and rude to his friends, but it shows that he really does care for all of them, and even though it may show a little, you can tell that he would do anything for his friends. Chizuru comes in later and joins the group of friends in an unexpected way; and even though it was surprising, the group gladly accepted him. That's what I loved about it, they gladly accepted Chizuru and all five of them became best friends. The minor characters, such as Masaki (also known as Mary), Azuma-sensei, etc., all have their own little stories; and the best part was that they were all different from each other's and not sound the same like how most anime/manga do it. So for characters? My rate would definitely be a 7.\\nENJOYMENT: 7! I enjoyed this anime from episode 1 to episode 13. If you enjoy anime that's about high school boys going through life, or anything about the daily lives of someone, then this anime is just for you.\\nOVERALL: 7. I have rewatched this anime three times, and let me tell you, it does not get old. Each time I watched it, I felt all cheery and happy inside, and it reminded me of my friends and how we acted and it reminded me how I need to keep my friendship with my friends strong so we can keep going like how the boys do in Kimi to Boku. I highly recommend this anime, especially if you want to laugh and smile!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '505bf471ed8966e8eefc74c2cb677aa8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I made a video: you can find it at my YouTube channel \"BasementOtaku\"\\nVideo Script:\\nYou and Me Season 1 (1/10): I know this rating might piss some people off so I would direct them to the video description on how to better understand my rating system. Now it is time to spiral headlong into this spoiler filled review.\\nYou and Me was a show that I discovered while going back through all of the seasonal anime on Crunchyroll and placing shows with high ratings and premises that interested me in my que. After Kokoro Connect blew my expectations of the water when I chose to give\\nit a watch, as I wasn’t expecting the show to feel that real or get that dark I had hoped to find another comparable show in You and Me. So when I saw “Together we will watch as they laugh, dance, cry and share the memories of growing up together in everyday life” referring to the group of friends pictured I figured that a show with three hundred and twenty nine five star ratings had to be SPECTACULAR and hit some really powerful character beats! Little did I know that the show was attempting to cash in on the ‘’cute boys do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING’ crowd.\\nNow the main reason You and Me season one is a one and not a four or five is because it keep leading me on and then smacking me on the head when I hoped for decent character development. The show even says multiple times throughout its run that the characters haven’t changed at all since they knew each other back in kindergarten. Which could have been a great setup to subvert character\\'s expectations as they all begin to grow apart or change as people and struggle to come to terms with those changes. Sadly the show seems more content with setting up those hooks only for us to learn that the characters are about as deep as their initial tropes that were established in episode one.\\nThat isn’t to say that the first season doesn’t have any redeeming qualities as the third episode, while slow, is still an interesting look at one of the twins and how they held some deep seeded self resentment around from their childhood. Then it is addressed at the end of the episode and it turns out it was no big deal but he still feels a little sad about it. It is a nice message about the importance of communication and that circumstances aren’t always what they seem, but then it NEVER ADDRESSES THAT AGAIN. The rest of the season is littered with unresolved or poorly resolved plot points.\\nEpisode one, we find out that glasses guy was into his kindergarten teacher and kind of still is but this never develops past a side gag. Episode two we meet the small angry girl character who does a complete 180 and falls in love with the effeminate group member who is oblivious to her interest and never goes past a running gag that she likes him and he doesn\\'t notice or she is too afraid to tell him. Episode five little blond guy starts to show interest in small angry girl but that goes unaddressed until episode two of season two. Episode seven has a very interesting premise about one of the twins saying yes to a girl who asks him out, this is where I really got my hopes up that the show would start to break down the established tropes and start to develop the characters, but all it turns into is the twin talking about missing his brother and the girl having crappy friends. Then it goes a step further and has the twin tell the girl to stick with her awful backstabbing friends because reasons. I was really hoping this would later come back and show how truly toxic the main group\\'s relationships with one another are but nothing ever develops and it is just an episode about staying in your lane even if it sucks. Episode eleven sets up the lunchlady arc and episode twelve introduces effeminate guys younger brother, both of which go unaddressed until season two. The rest of the episodes are gag episodes that do nothing to develop the characters or further any subplot.\\nNow you might be wondering why I gave season one and season two separate scores when they obviously share story ties and I would ask Crunchyroll the same question. Because as of writing this review Crunchyroll has them listed as separate shows. The only reason I found there was a season two is because I couldn’t believe season one was that awful and inconclusive so I looked it up and discovered there was a season two. If you are interested on my thoughts, you can check out my season two video. As for my season one thoughts I’m fairly certain it is clear, this is the worst show I have ever finished, hence the one out of ten rating.\\nAlso I forgot to mention the show is incredibly boring!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9574fe48b53becff91cfa9d790e25034'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Kimi to Boku – or You and Me, in English – is a slice of life anime touted as a very realistic glimpse into the daily lives of five high school boys.  Praised for its lack of melodrama and absence of overdone cutesy-ness, this anime promises viewers a blend of comedy, everyday drama and a touch of romance, delivered in a laid-back, down-to-earth way.  A refreshing concept in a genre riddled with tired tropes and rehashed storylines, but does it work?  Well, not quite.\\nAfter reading a large number of positive reviews for this show, I was expecting to enjoy a realistic representation\\nof high school life, albeit without too much drama.  I was also looking forward to meeting a cast of characters complete with well-rounded personalities, depth and some direction to their lives.  Unfortunately, I was let down on all fronts.\\nThe first issue that is readily apparent in Kimi to Boku is the characters, who are little more than one-dimensional clichés – the girly boy, the uptight glasses-wearing guy, the cool and good-looking twins, the energetic and annoying kid…  Although it steers clear of many of the biggest pitfalls of ‘factory-farmed’ slice of life anime, unfortunately Kimi to Boku still forsakes originality for total familiarity.\\nThe second problem is that the show’s strict no-melodrama approach works against it, as there are never any obstacles presented to our one-dimensional characters to help them gain any new dimensions.  As a result, all of our five boys seem to have the same personalities throughout the series, never even evolving from who they were in their elementary school flashbacks.\\nThe plot is debatably realistic in the sense that nothing extraordinary happens.  On the other hand, I would argue that it is too plain and boring to be realistic.  Watch as our main characters engage in thumb wars, walk around to various places, do homework, talk about putting salt on watermelon, cut each other’s hair and bicker a lot.  I found myself literally dozing off in several episodes, thinking that instead of watching Shun, Kaname et al do nothing I could actually be doing something – anything – more interesting than watching Kimi to Boku.\\nIn defence of the show, once in a while it does have moments of brilliance. The art, sound and direction in episode five made me feel immersed in the height of summer, even though it was winter outside.  Yuuta wiping away a girl’s tears in episode seven is surprisingly tender.  These magical moments, however, are frustratingly few and far between, and proof of Kimi to Boku’s inability to create anything consistently engaging and solid from its basic premise.\\nNo noteworthy events, no conflict, no character development, no discernible plot – that is Kimi to Boku.  Unfortunately its attempt to do slice of life differently is misguided – life does have its noteworthy events, conflict, character development and drama, and that’s what makes it fun, entertaining and challenging.  For the most part, Kimi to Boku is not fun, entertaining or challenging.\\nYou may like Kimi to Boku if you enjoy watching ‘cute’ high school boys do mundane, typical slice of life stuff to the detriment of all else – and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  If that is not your cup of tea, however, switch off your computer, go outside and do something interesting with your own life, instead of watching these 2D cartoon characters do nothing with theirs.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd48f121cdb7a0c1d67a84066b57c180c'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I have to admit at first I found the cast of You and Me a bit off-putting, but I changed my mind when I got to know them better. The first one we meet is Shun, who\\'s not exactly traditionally masculine: we see him initially with long hair, he speaks in a gentle tone (and is the peacemaker of the group), likes to cook, and is occasionally actually mistaken for a girl.\\nNext we have identical twins Yuta and Yuki. At first they really seem utterly identical- they have the same sleepy eyes, they speak in the same monotone deadpan manner, and they both enjoy harassing\\nKaname (in a droll manner of course, since that\\'s all their flat delivery can do.) Another thing they have in common is that they can do almost anything effortlessly, but there IS a difference here, for while Yuta has used his capabilities and joined numerous clubs, Yuki- well- just doesn\\'t want to make the effort. (In one later episode, in particular, we\\'ll see just what a slacker Yuki can be.) It takes several episodes, including one mostly featuring just the twins, to establish their relationship for the viewers, but in short Yuta feels like he has to be the \"responsible\" one, as the eldest (but since they\\'re twins, that\\'s surely not by more than minutes), and spends a great deal of time telling his brother to do more at home. (We\\'ll also get to see where these traits come from.) Yuki does, with considerable cajoling from all, eventually join a manga club (and his efforts there- or lack of same- lead to one of the show\\'s most visually funny episodes.) As the \"rebel\", Yuki\\'s share of the show\\'s attention eclipses his brother\\'s; he even develops a romantic interest toward a cafeteria worker (whose face is actually drawn a lot like that of the twins.)\\nOne\\'s first impression of Kaname is as just a crabby curmudgeon with glasses. He\\'s the sort who complains profusely if his familiar routine is disturbed (and thus is particularly annoyed by Chizuru, a routine-disturber of extraordinary magnitude who we\\'ll meet shortly.) On the other hand, we see that even in kindergarten Kaname was the guy who sacrificed himself for the others, and still basically functions as the group\\'s (rather martyred) mom. He\\'s also surprisingly good with kids, given his irascible nature. There\\'s a weird thing going on with his own mom- she often acts strangely immature, more like his neglected girlfriend than his mother. He rather brusquely brushes her off when she\\'s like this, but maybe shows some evidence of a mother complex himself in an obsession with older women. His first crush was on his kindergarten teacher, and he currently has one on the older of two sisters who live next door, Shizuna Aida, though Shizuna\\'s younger sister Hisako, Kaname\\'s classmate, seems more likely to return Kaname\\'s feelings, if he\\'d just direct them her way. Here and elsewhere in this show, it\\'s painful to watch people being unable to say what\\'s actually on their minds, maybe more so because of our own regrets about things we wish we\\'d said at that age.\\nChizuru seems to add discord to the bunch, but his personality actually complements theirs. He\\'s half-Japanese; they don\\'t just draw him blond, his \"straw-colored\" hair gets referenced in their conversations, and when he first met one of them, Yuki, years earlier, he couldn\\'t even speak Japanese. He\\'s exuberant and irrepressible, a \"class clown\" who\\'s tactless and awkward, a well-meaning soul but one whose poor judgment and lack of caution frequently get his new pals in hot water. He has a crush on a girl named Masaki Sato (who he calls \"Mary\"), but in classic triangle fashion Masaki only has eyes for Shun.\\nThe show has quite a bit of humor, but it tends to stay low-key and realistic above all.\\nIt\\'s a show that portrays the borderline of adulthood with all its optimism and enthusiasm-but also its awkwardness and disappointments; with its blossoming of feelings- but also its inevitable chances of hurting others, or being hurt oneself. It isn\\'t always brilliant- there\\'s some filler, it\\'s slow-moving at times, and as I said I would have divided up the characters\\' \"stage time\" a bit differently-but it\\'s often as honest a depiction of teenage life as I\\'ve ever seen, and I ALWAYS give extra points for honesty.\\nOverall Rating - 10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2df6c30ee516b60fa7ceaede63c5ba63'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Overall: 7.7 / 10\\nIntroduction:\\nThe best way I find to be transparent with this show is that it turns out to be the perfect dose of everyday life combined with its Comedy and Romance. Kimi to Boku is an anime in which it turns out to have a very \"chill\" environment to relax and enjoy, but it is not only about it, but as you delve into their history you will reveal what each character has to contribute to the series and distributed equally in terms of their relationships so that no one feels less than the others.\\nStory: 7\\nThe plot of it, although it is interesting\\nbecause it seeks to show the concepts of adolescence and how our group of protagonists are creating new links on their way, whether of love or friendship, I also need to clarify that it is one of the pointsSince it does not require the same to be a pleasant attraction for the viewer so on my part it achieves its mission without more.\\nArt: 7.5 / Sound: 8.5\\nIn these sections I highlight especially the musical, it is really very gratifying the melodies that the program recreates both during the chapters and in its openings and closings that mark the path of what the anime requires and knows how to fulfill it to the letter. Already in the animation I am also satisfied that I feel that it is a neat adaptation without great aspects to highlight, but it does not leave errors along the way\\nCharacters: 8\\nWe get to the strong part of Kimi to boku his characters.\\nIn general, this factor is what gives life and makes the whole anime a success, having a very charismatic cast of characters is what you need in any average daily life, if you want it to be a true success, and here it was a great demonstration with a cheerful cast at the same time as a comedian, and not satisfied with this, it was decided to add a bonus of \"love development\" to each one that raised the level of the program even more.\\nEnjoy: 7.5\\nThis is a show as I mentioned in the introduction is to come and have a very relaxed time and disconnect the brain for a while without more, but it is not like in the particular thing that happens to me with most of \"Slice of life\" that I become extremely sleeping pills, but here time really flies by with the great cast of characters mixed with their moments of love confusion and the synergy they handle between their group of friends and even with comedy scenes that really fulfill their role without a doubt RECOMMENDED\\n---------------------------- EN ESPAÑOL --------------------------------------\\nGeneral: 7,7 / 10\\nIntroducción:\\nLa mejor forma que encuentro de ser transparente con este programa es que resulta ser la perfecta dosis entre una vida cotidiana combinada con su Comedia e Romance. Kimi to Boku es un anime en cual resulta tener un ambiente muy \"chill\" para relajarse y disfrutar, pero que no se trata solamente de ello, sino que a medida que te adentras en sus historia iras revelando lo que cada personaje tiene para aportar a la serie y distribuido de forma equitativa en cuanto a sus sus relaciones para que ninguno se sienta menos que los demás.\\nHistoria: 7\\nLa trama del mismo si bien resulta interesante por que busca mostrar los conceptos de la adolescencia y como nuestro grupo de protagonistas van creando nuevos vínculos en su camino, ya sea de amor o amistad, también eh de aclarar que es uno de los puntos que tal vez menos le importa marcar un camino a este espectáculo. Ya que no requiere del mismo para lograr ser una atracción agradable para el espectador por lo que de mi parte logra su cometido sin mas.\\nArte: 7,5 / Sonido: 8,5\\nEn estos apartados destaco sobre todo lo musical, realmente es muy gratificante las melodías que recrea el programa tanto durante los capitulos como en sus aperturas y cierres que marcan el camino de lo requiere el anime y sabe cumplirlo al pie de la letra. Ya en la animación también me quedo conforme siento que resulta una adaptación prolija sin grandes aspectos que destacar, pero tampoco deja errores por el camino\\nPersonajes: 8\\nLlegamos a la parte fuerte de Kimi to boku sus caracteres.\\nEn general este factor es el que le da vida y logra que todo el anime sea un exito, tener un elenco de personajes muy carismático es lo que necesitas en cualquier vida cotidiana promedio, si es que quieres que sea un verdadero éxito, y aquí fue una gran demostración con un elenco alegre a la vez de cómico, y que no conforme con esto se le decidió agregar un plus de \"desarrollo amoroso\" a cada uno que le elevo aun mas el nivel del programa.\\nDisfrute: 7,5\\nEste es un espectáculo como mencione en la introducción es para venir a pasarlo muy relajado y desconectar un rato el cerebro sin mas, pero que no es como en lo particular que me pasa con la mayoría de \"Slice of life\" que se me vuelven extremadamente somníferos, sino que aquí realmente el tiempo se pasa volando con el gran elenco de personajes mezclado con sus momentos de confusiones amorosas y la sinergia que manejan entre su grupo de amigos y hasta con escenas de comedia que realmente cumplen su cometido sin dudas RECOMENDADO', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2022fbee23b6f3fdca334e6c958bfd39'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Major is one of my favorite anime franchises of all time, let alone my favorite sports anime franchise by quite some distance. It’s characterization, intense matches and long-running storytelling present in many seasons with consistency always captivated me in so many ways. With its successor, Major 2nd having a very impressive first season (especially for being the sequel to a long-running success story already and not disappointing like a Boruto compared to Naruto), I was quite excited for this new season of Major to drop back in April. Here are some of my thoughts on the 8th overall season of the Major franchise and the\\n2nd season of Major 2nd by Takuya Mitsuda!\\nStory/Writing (9/10)\\nMajor 2nd season 2 takes place a couple of years after the first season where Daigo Shigeno is now in Junior High, where he turns out to be the captain of the Fuurin baseball team. A team that is mostly full of girls (which also has his crime partner, Mutsuko Sakura from the Dolphins days) since a lot of the fellow guys on the team got kicked out due to a shoplifting incident, leaving Daigo alone with one guy (later two), to join the girls to form a baseball team with the thinnest roster imaginable. Hell, there isn’t even a proper coach in this team so, despite Fuurin’s previous reputation of being a competitive team, the lack of personnel automatically put Daigo in a tricky situation.\\nCompared to the second season of the original Major where it had Goro conquering so many physical obstacles like returning from a potentially career-ending shoulder injury and switching to being a southpaw pitcher, to joining rival school Kaido along with Toshiya and go through multiple trials to get a taste of the immense competition awaiting his baseball future, this season feels a lot more tamer than that but presents its own challenges that Daigo and Fuurin have to go through. This occasion, mainly as a team that is all over the place – some players have talent but no real desire to get down and succeed through it all, some players have a lack of talent completely, some players have talent but are too rough and inexperienced to conquer against competition that is much highly skilled and have much more depth too than all of them, the fact that most of the team are comprised of females which a lot of teams tend to look down on, etc. This is a season that surrounds itself through teamwork as a whole, and working together to grow as a cohesive unit and try to pose a challenge to opposing teams despite the handicaps and hardships that they have had to endure as a team altogether. They may not have a coach or a proper bench (hell, some starters are barely classified as rookies despite some others playing baseball in the past in Little League), but through Daigo’s development as a leader, they still fight on; even with an obvious glass ceiling that hangs above them given how the state of the team is.\\nThe story itself for me is really entertaining for the most part as with a refreshing take on a cast and a more long-term focus on the Junior High section of Major 2nd which will extend past this season, it showcases the more gradual build that this show is laying the foundation of with this edition. The next season is where a lot of the big-time matches will kick off so this season focuses more on the development to get to that place and to build some tension for Daigo and potential rivals too for the future. For the most part, I feel like everything’s done well and organically too. There are points in the story where the pacing feels rushed, like at the end of certain matches and an oddly placed timeskip, but despite those flaws, I found the development of the cast and most of the matches itself to be extremely well crafted and drawn out for the entire season. Compared to a lot of anime this year which lost my interest narratively really quickly, Major 2nd offers some of the best character writing I’ve seen this year as well as in the franchise itself. It may not have the epic matches in season 5 or the great emotional punches in season 1 but the focus on teamwork with an evenly matched cast that doesn’t rely itself on Goro Shigeno makes it one of the most enjoyable and lovable seasons to date.\\nCharacters (9.5/10)\\nThe Furin Junior High Baseball team consisted of a mix of female and male baseball players (mostly females). So already, the cast, in general, feels very different from the traditional cast you would find in any sports anime let alone a Major season. Here, this anime showcases one of the rare times where both genders play important roles to work together as a team so that whole dynamic is pretty interesting and refreshing for the most part, and I’m glad Takuya Mitsuda chose to go with this direction, especially since for High School onwards, he can only mainly focus on Daigo and males due to the Koshien not allowing guy-girl teams to participate together unlike with Junior High.\\nDaigo himself I felt was a really good protagonist again like the previous season but takes on a much more different role than the traditional sports protagonist. Daigo isn’t as hotheaded and charismatic as Goro in the original edition of Major, but with a more confident, serious, and determined personality at hand, Daigo came across as a genuine leader in this one. A leader who would work as hard as he could to bring the best out of his teammates to make up for the many obstacles that they have to overcome being a team that had no coach and barely a cohesive squad due to a lot of the older players being kicked out for shoplifting. He’s showcased some nice development from the first season and played a really good role in being the quiet but tactical and observational captain who also had the passion and heart for baseball to motivate his teammates to try and succeed alongside him.\\nAnother character that returned was Mutsuko Sakura into having a more prominent role this season as probably the 2nd main character instead of Hikaru last season. While her personality hasn’t changed much, her passion for baseball has grown immensely and she’s become a pitcher now compared to being a slogger previously. Given the lack of teammates in Fuurin, she took the responsibility for becoming a pitcher and the show did a good job with her development to be a competent pitcher than can compete with a lot of teams in tournaments (still not the best of the best ones though). Plus, she was also the support that the team needed at times given strained times as she could relate to her teammates but also to Daigo too if he was under pressure or was putting too much work down to improve everyone else. Plus she’s still charming, sweet, and likable too so those are all bonuses to how good she is.\\nThen you have the rest of the team who mostly are enjoyable to watch and a really good supporting cast as a whole to the anime with a few standouts being Yayoi Sawa, one of my favorite characters of the year for just her calm, cool and collected personality as well as Chisato Fuji for being really sweet, charming and quite the devilish little troll at times when teasing others, especially her sister Chiyo. Some characters like Tanba didn’t quite receive much spotlight as well as Kandori but for the most part, the baseball club all shined together due to how much this season focused on teamwork and how each player is important to the success of the team, especially since none of them aren’t as talented, fiery and motivational to win like a Goro Shigeno.\\nThe rival teams also had a nice mix of new characters, old characters returning from Little League (Andy, Urabe, Michiru) and old characters returning from the original Major edition (Goro, Fuji) to all have their good moments too whether in playing baseball against Fuurin or just by being a small part of the Fuurin journey to grow and develop like with Goro.\\nSo overall, I really loved the characters as a whole and this club as a whole might be one of my favorite sports clubs I’ve seen in anime based on the teams. Teamwork made the cast grow nicely together, especially chemistry wise and it really shows here.\\nArt/Animation (9.5/10)\\nMajor 2nd season 2’s art for the most part looks really different not only from previous Major seasons but from sports anime in general. It has more of this slice of life-like feel to it less than the typical sports anime but for the most part, I loved this refreshing change.\\nWhile the episodes down the line do look a tad weaker than how it started (mainly due to the number of delays this show suffered due to COVID-19), the show looked damn good. It was colorful, the character designs were great, the animation for the baseball matches was better than ever – especially seeing the pitches feel more realistic and varied and just seeing the runners slide and batters swing look more satisfying and real as ever. The colors also pop really nicely too overall in this show as well. For a baseball anime, while it may not have the intense Haikyuu or Hajime no Ippo like moments in terms of animation, this edition of Major leaned more towards the calm, realistic style, which looked amazing. OLM brought the best out of this anime and even with having to deal with COVID-19 delays, they did such a stellar job overall with bringing this anime to life with how fantastic it looks overall.\\nSome of the visuals for the openings looked fantastic too, especially the colorful nature of the 2nd opening with the paint flying everywhere while showing all characters there.\\nSound (9/10)\\nThe sound department was strong here, as usual for a Major anime. The background music has a nice variety of calm tracks, funny tracks for comedy moments, and intense tracks when getting down to the clutch moments in a baseball game. Major’s always been strong for me when it comes to music and how it fits a variety of moments, and this season is no different whatsoever.\\nThe opening songs were really catchy for me as well since I never wanted to skip it at all due to how fun it sounded, especially the first one ‘Answer’. The songs again, not the traditional sports opening songs as it felt more like a josei/slice of life song but for the atmosphere of the show, it works nicely.\\nThe voice acting also was great, with some standouts being Kana Hanazawa as Mutsuko and Sumire Uesaka portraying the perfect cute devil in Chisato. For the most part, all the voice actors/actresses fit their roles really well for the entirety of the show and delivered nicely in the range of emotions that the show provided overall.\\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\nIn a year where I’ve been disappointed by so many shows and dislike so many shows, Major 2nd season 2 has been a genuine breath of fresh air. It’s not only a refreshing show since it’s actually great but also gives a refreshing feel to the Major franchise and the sports genre as a whole. And given how this Junior High arc is not over yet with this season, it feels like one of the most important Major arcs to date which makes it more exciting. The matches and characters were just really great overall, and I had a blast watching this anime when I desperately needed something decent from this year.\\nThe journey for the airing of this 2nd season was a damn bumpy one, to say the least as it got hit with numerous delays in the earlier half of the season, where episodes would not air for more than a month to make up for production scheduling to ensure that the season can finish somehow. But in the end, it managed to actually finish and I’m glad since unlike Kingdom season 3, I get to actually complete a clear anime of the year candidate this year itself.\\nMajor 2nd season 2 was an excellent anime and an excellent addition to the Major franchise despite feeling a lot different from the other 7 seasons overall (Major + first season of Major 2nd). When it comes to ranking seasons, this for me is behind Major S5 and Major S1 but ahead of the others. Definitely recommend the whole Major franchise as a whole, let alone just this one anyway but for Major fans, this anime should be a treat just like the rest.\\nScore 9.5/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c53d9590b589aba223e3a396a5cbc331'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'One of the things Major2nd did, is not being the original Major, instead concentrating on hot head skilled baseball player Goro, it is focusing on his son Daigo who unlike his father doesn’t have a lot of skills in the destined sport, and though S1 already gone with it, S2 is still with it, Daigo is still not the shiny player in his middle school team, though to be the captain, the focus in this season is not at his relationship with his childhood friend Satou Hikaru that the first season concentrate on building up In the first season, the 2nd season concentrate on something\\nMajor haven’t done until now - character development.\\nIt’s not to say that the rest of Major seasons doesn’t have them, but in most of the season the focus was on Goro and his playing, the rest of his team gets less attention, and sometimes, only chosen from there elected to be developed, in Major2nd S2 the focus is only, but only, at every member of the Fuurin team, it concentrate so much on each of the members that even the usual rival team characters don’t get the usual attention, even Daigo who supposed to be main character, feels like any other members on the team.\\nStory - 8\\nThose who watched already S1 of Major2nd, know already the story not going the same old way of the Goro’s Major series, but going in little different way, as we said, Daigo is not the best baseball player, and though he improved his catcher skills, he doesn’t care to let others takes that spot, and so we get a story of Daigo being important character as a captain of the team, as he needs to raise it to win the tournament.\\nOne of the first things to see at the start of the season is there’s a kinda of time skip between the seasons, at first I thought - what happened between them, and how actually Daigo made to be the captain, but the anime actually fills it later, but that’s not the important stuff - by time skipping without filling the anime actually shows us it doesn’t matter, not yet - there’s more important stuff that we should notice and know, and that’s how the season start like S3 of Major - there’s no enough players, and Daigo needs to gather more few players so his team could enter the tournament.\\nIn fact, I found that this season comprised to S3 of Major, where Goro takes school without baseball team, and though he manage to build one, it’s a weak one, and Goro needs to raise it to succeed, though there’s a lot of similarities because Daigo does need to train his teammates to win the league, Fuurin team is not that bad once players are gathered, it’s actually team that have a variety of players, each with his own skills, and unlikely in S3 of Major where Goro hold the whole team, Daigo only leading them to do their best.\\nSo if the base of the season is not Daigo raising weak team, what makes the S2 ticking? As I said earlier, it’s the characters here, because as for the story, it’s like every other sport school club anime, and like every such an anime making sportively and competitive, S2 succeed in it’s character development, and to add more to the picture, most of the team is actually girls, which actually make the anime in more style of women sport anime, but still can get of it’s own in term of story like Major can do.\\nAnd that’s what make the story of S2 more appealing, not only on succeeding and be the best but also concentrating more on:\\nCharacters - 9\\nWe will start with Daigo, which gets the main focus on the series, not because he’s the much important, in fact, as said, Daigo gets the same treatment as the other team players, the reason however he’s the main focus, is because he’s the captain, and there’s not a match that the team doesn’t need the captain to lead them, I think that is actually his treatment due the rules in this seasons to develop any character on the team, and because Daigo still haven’t found yet his destined position on the pitch, he gets to stand out only as the captain, to let other characters evolve.\\nSakura for example, gets much more upgrade in her role, if In S1 she got kinda the main supporting character, here her effective is much crucial, she’s not only member on the team, but also gets important position, and also as we saw in the first season, have some kind of one side crush on Daigo, that gets little development in the season.\\nWhat I meant earlier saying that the character development in S2 is much more than usual, it’s mainly because in the other seasons of Major the other characters gets little of them, but in this season, each new character gets his own stage in each game - Nishina, Chisato, Sagara, Sawa, Kabashima and those not all the team, and each and very one of them gets their screen time to develop, and that’s what really ticks the season, there’s a lot of sport, and like S1 there’s a lot of explanations and training, but those not for the sake of the sport, but for the sake of each character development.\\nAnimation - 7\\nOne of the things about the animation of S2 is that I believe have 2 sides - good, and bad.\\nThe good is - it’s much more cleaner, much more realistic and refreshing than the animation of the rest of the seasons, the colours and the lines are well drawn, there’ll be those who will criticise the character design to be little different, but I actually think it didn’t changed that at all, but because the new animation style it looks different.\\nThe bad side, is not that bad actually, but more of a hunch, the new style let the anime feel of slice of life, though the anime doesn’t lack it it also doesn’t have the general feeling of Major, and though that in good quality it’s sharp and all, OLM kinda let the anime feel like their other series - childish feeling, it’s not ruining at all, but it’s also not letting me feel the old Major feel, and though the season doesn’t try to be Major style but have it own style, it let the feeling that it’s less sport anime.\\nMusic - 8\\nThe OST of Major is highly improved, and adds a lot of intensity to the games.\\nThe 1st opening is easily one of my favourite and make good impression, and the 1st ending and 2nd ending as well, and though the 2nd opening is very good, It lost a little the originality of the 1st.\\nEnjoyment/Overall - 9/8\\nMajor2nd S2 truly takes kind high risk in doing some things the other seasons haven’t done - concentrating on character development of the main team and less on the rival team, though in some important cases it does, it doesn’t forget about who the anime is, and OLM did great job directing it, though to be little weird season compared to the other seasons that their full focus is on the sport, in S2 the sport is good as the rest, the tense, the excitement and the ambition to be the best team is still there, but the theme of the season is changed, and Daigo is not Goro and only the captain, really no more than that, but it still Major and does it in great way.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '209778120aba91bc176343e1c819ca95'}>,\n",

Last season was 25 eps and I don’t think this one will be 52 so this early review should be fine.\\nStory: 7 If you haven’t seen the first season then just know that the 1st season was about the main character finding himself and catching up with the old characters (and their kids). This 2nd season is honestly really comparable to the 3rd season of major where its about our main character making the most out of his schools now almost non-existent baseball team with\\nthe caveat that this time it’s a mostly girls team. Also don’t expect super intense baseball like the original major or Diamond no Ace, the anime as a whole has a more slice of life kind of feel though it’s still is predominantly a sports anime.\\nArt: 8 This brings us to the art which is not bad but very simple. This anime definitely makes sure to show the realities of middle school semi-casual baseball with most of the pitches and impact sounds being very mundane though I think the batting is always shown off quite nicely. I like most of the character designs, being simple but you can definitely see their personality still. Overall, not bad but nothing too exciting.\\nSound: 9 It’s a baseball anime through and through with the bats swinging through the air, the baseball impacting the catcher gloves and metal smacking balls to the outfield. Its nothing too spectacular though I will note I really like the OP and ED (ED being surprisingly melancholic).\\nCharacter: 6 So this one is hard and probably a rating that will change but is a good one to look at in terms of this being an early review of the show. The characters on Daigo’s team are all supposed to be flawed and not very good baseball players and the anime makes sure to keep that in your mind with many of the characters making a lot of mistakes and having not great personalities. This all contrasts with Daigo’s (main char) personality which is solid and developed now while still pushing him. For now, its honestly a rough watch as seeing bad characters play bad baseball is definitely a meh feeling but I can say that at episode 10 things overall seems to be swinging up with 2 of the unlikable characters starting to get their redeeming moments.\\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7 I honestly would recommend this anime and its first season especially if you were a fan of the original major series as it is what I would expect from a kids version of major, its sorta like Boruto in terms of new interesting characters except at least this one doesn’t outright make the old characters worse at all. It’s a slow but enjoyable watch, but just remember that this is a sports anime where the whole point is that the team is starting out rough but is showing signs of getting there.

       "  <Document: {'content': '\"Samurai Champloo\" may not have the same ring to it as \"Cowboy Bebop,\" yet it is a title that has a similar function: to illustrate a combination of multicultural pulp fiction sensibility.  Where Cowboy Bebop was a past + future fusion of jazz, rock, and blues, spaghetti western, kung fu, and noir cinema genres, and a setting equating outer space to the great frontier, Samurai Champloo is a more wildly anachronistic mélange of Edo-period history and contemporary hip-hop and bohemian culture.  \"Champloo\" itself comes from the word \"chanpurū,\" Okinawan for \"something mixed,\" and a source of Okinawa\\'s pride in multicultural acceptance.  Cowboy\\nBebop was a trend-setting marriage of anime traditions and Tarantino-inspired cultural hodgepodge — it could be said that Pulp Fiction influenced Cowboy Bebop as much as Cowboy Bebop influenced Kill Bill — and Samurai Champloo continues in this meta style, taking it even further.\\nOf course, Cowboy Bebop was not Shinichiro Watanabe\\'s first foray into resonant crossover in anime: Macross Plus was a monolithic amalgamation of Top Gun\\'s hot-headed romantic drama and sci-fi tropes including a pop-idol hologram version of 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s HAL, in turn influencing the famous cyberpunk writer William Gibson to write Idoru, a novel about a Japanese virtual idol and her marriage to a real-life rock star.  Of course, all of this was before the invention of the Vocaloid, though I suppose the future imagined by Watanabe and Gibson was, in a way, not so far off.\\nAnyhow, now that I\\'ve finished my little history lesson — which I feel is relevant, as having such a perspective may deepen your enjoyment of Samurai Champloo as much as it did for me — let\\'s continue on to the review.  In light of all the prescient futurism found in Watanabe\\'s other works, it\\'s rather interesting that he decided to shift his focus to the past and present.  Of course, the world\\'s future is always in its past... and what we have here is, in a nutshell, Edo-period Japan: the remix.  Baseball, tagging/graffiti, Van Gogh, zombies, and Catholicism are tossed into the \"chanpurū\" with a whole lot of revised Japanese pseudo-history.  As such the medley of influences and tangential tale-spinning occasionally smacks of filler, but one would do well to understand that this show is simply all /about/ the filler — and this is all for the better, because Samurai Champloo is at its freshest and most hilarious when it\\'s veering off the rails.  It even has the single most entertaining recap episode I\\'ve ever seen.  Even with all this episodic improv, Fuu\\'s journey in search of a \"samurai who smells like sunflowers\" provides a compelling core to the story, much like a steady hip-hop beat giving structure to the mix of samples and freestyle verses.  Her ronin traveling companions Mugen and Jin mingle like oil and water, and there we have the perfect cast for hilarity and drama.\\nSamurai Champloo is one good-looking show, with its thick linework giving an impression of manga blended with graffiti style.  One episode even takes a quick trip into the psychedelic, with a sudden burst of colorful hallucination, Mind Game style — courtesy of episode key animator Masaaki Yuasa, of course.  A wide variety of such notable animators were brought on board and thus the style occasionally varies slightly from episode to episode or even scene to scene, but it\\'s always pleasing and completely in tune with the show\\'s theme.  Rural Japan has never looked so urban; almost any given scene in Samurai Champloo would be right at home spray-painted on the side of a city building or underpass.\\nThe music, likewise, blends hip-hop, rhythm & blues, and traditional Japanese shamisen.  Music often plays second fiddle to the look and quality of the animation when it comes to my enjoyment of anime, but in some cases it becomes just as important.  This is one such anime, where the music contributes so greatly to the feel of it that it defines it and sets it apart from other anime — much like the soundtrack by Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did for Cowboy Bebop.  It\\'s also worth mentioning that rap and beatboxing sometimes enter the dialogue, and it\\'s always amusing.  Admittedly, most younger people these days are far more familiar with hip-hop than they are with the jazz, blues, and big band genres; nonetheless, in the realm of anime this feels a bit groundbreaking, especially with the theme songs featuring Japanese rap lyrics.  The world is getting bigger and smaller every day.\\nSamurai Champloo is a show for everyone.  Plenty of great sword-slashing action, clever comedy, and a good share of moments that will tug at your heartstrings — often all at once.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I caught Samurai Champloo as it aired back in 2004, and though I liked it enough, it didn’t impact me as much as I hoped it would. Though maybe that’s not entirely true, as the soundtrack did indirectly change my life, thanks to the composer Nujabes introducing me to instrumental hip hop and providing a soundtrack to my life for the next few years.\\nI recently re-watched the show and felt compelled to write a retrospective/review of the series. While watching Jin, Mugen and Fuu traipse around 19th century Japan getting into ridiculous adventures, I realised Shinichirô Watanabe’s follow up to Cowboy Bebop is one of\\nthe most subversive animes ever made. Taking a staple genre, dressing it up in anachronism, but continually tackling subjects often avoided by the medium.\\nIt takes 25 episodes until a character literally says “I was born in the wrong era.” Champloo is basically saying Japan’s lofty samurai era was actually a shit place to live for common people like us actually thank you very much.\\nIt’s a divisive show that tested the patience of many viewers, drove others away entirely after a few episodes, and frustrated people who were too used to watching a plot move characters forward for 26 episodes. Champloo doesn’t even have characters who move the plot forward. The hook of how the three disparate characters end up travelling together through Edo period Japan is just that, it’s a hook to draw you in.\\nSamurai Champloo is about, and also not about, three characters hunting a samurai who smells of sunflowers. There’s an episode late into the series which features two street gangs having a graffiti battle across town, and though somewhat amusing also served no benefit towards the journey of the three characters. So if you hop into any forum thread you’ll see a multitude of complaints about it. However, the point of the episode is the same as the theme running throughout the entire show: people from a bygone era rebelling against authority and social norms in a way 21st century people do: through counter-culture.\\nI’ve gained a new appreciation for this show. It’s been so so long since I saw it, but rewatching it I realise how the story is about how incompatible Tokugawa era Japan is with our way of life; all the things we take for granted were rare luxuries back then. This is an obvious fact for anyone with a remote understanding of Japanese history, but still, the show rams it home with stark contrasts. Each episode highlights a 21st century aspect of our lives, a form of freedom (creative, sexual, geographical, etc) that characters in the 19th century yearned for despite the odds.\\nIt’s set in an era ruled by rigid order, social rules and hierarchies. Stifling to the point of causing grief among the downtrodden populace. Yet a populace we should not treat as foreign aliens. The show asks us to empathise with them; they were just like us. Some of them had our modern spirit and ultimately struggled to exist in such a society as a result. Our heroes are a ronin, vagabond, and an orphan. Fighting against their era’s rules with a modern spirit.\\nOne of the things I love about this show is how the three characters hate each other for the majority of the 26 episodes, but their hatred gives away inch by inch. They initially try to break apart, to run away from each other, but situations conspire to brig them back together, until a turning point where they actively make a choice to stick together, grudgingly recognising that they are of the same fiery rebellious soul. This is infinitely more satisfying than characters who automatically stick together from the outset. Another theme of Champloo is that travelling a journey with strangers can bring you together like family.\\nChamploo is more known for its scenes that are juxtaposed with modern quirks such as people beatboxing to humorous and surreal effect, and scene transitions that look like a DJ playing with their deck.\\nEpisode topics try to cover every area that is barely explored by other samurai-era anime that are more concerned with traditional ‘fight evil’ plots (or even movies for that matter) from the prevalence of the yakuza co-existing with samurai, the tragedy of women forced into prostitution to pay off their husbands’ debts, human trafficking in the art world, existence of homosexuality, persecution of Christians and Ainu, and graffiti gangs with too much time on their hands. There’s even a hilarious baseball game with members of an American expedition that predates Commodore Perry’s by a few years.\\nChamploo features one of the best soundtracks ever, brought to you by Nujabes, whose life was tragically cut short in 2010. Instrumental hip hop might bring to your mind a certain perception of what to expect, but the soundtrack is a mixture of traditional beats with Japanese influence, floating ephemeral sounds constantly conjure a feeling of melancholy, or ‘mono no aware’, the fleeting transience of things.\\nThe appeal of the show is ‘style over substance’, however that is a great discredit to what Champloo accomplishes. All the modern quirks in historical context are not just there to make the show stand out visually. The show is about entertaining this idea, this hope, that even back in Edo era Japan there were open-minded people fighting for creativity, individuality and basic human rights. Sure, most of them didn’t last long, but they didn’t die without a fight.

One of the very few things Champloo and Bebop have in common is their great scores. Champloo mixes two subjects which would never be put in one sentence together, western hip-hop and eastern samurai swordplay. Yet the mixture comes out with a brilliant result. The fights scenes are hyped up with the speed and flow from the music and come out magnificent. But Champloo isn't all about fighting. Many things happen along the road for the\\nthree main characters: Mugen, a rough mouth vagrant with a fighting style similar to capoeira with a sword. Jin, a quite and intelligent ronin who fights with deadly lightning speeds. And Fuu, the ditsy waitress that brings these two together in search of a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Between these three we see many moments of humorous antics, whether it's Mugen poking insults at her flat chest or Mugen and Jin’s constant attempts on each others life. Samurai Champloo is fueled by Action, Comedy, and Drama. Together with an original story Samurai Champloo has a unique spin on the old samurai era making it a great find for any fan of anime.\\nStory\\nThe story of Champloo is an original work from Shinichiro Watanabe. The story centers on Fuu’s search for a samurai who smells of sunflowers. As the wanders continue on their travel they encounter many problems, mostly dealing with how to make money for their various expenses some times causing trouble for the three. In the travels many humorous things occur like Mugen entering a beetle type cock fight, Jin and Mugen’s adventure in to the red-light district, or the three entering an eating contest. As the three get closer to the samurai who smells of sunflowers, things begin to unravel leading the three to the most trouble they have ever seen.\\nAnimation\\nChamploo has crisp clean stylistic animation. Characters are draw clean and clear with many details. The landscapes of Champloo are filled with beautiful shots of Japan’s country side. There are even a few scenes were the animation becomes only black and white and seem as they where draw straight from sketches to add to the scene. There is also one part were the colors and animation becomes so lively that it gives the impression of a whacked out hallucination.\\nSound\\nThe score of Champloo is what sets its self apart from any other anime in its genre. The background music is filled with urban hip-hop to give it a loose free flowing fill to it. A big portion of Champloo is focused on its original sound and it shows. For action scenes we get a fast flowing sound that gives the sword fights a more stylistic feel to them. For the more dramatic scenes we get deeper sounding background music. There are even moments during some flash back scenes were the music that we get to hear a rich Japanese sound to give a deeper feeling to it.\\nCharacters\\nSamurai Champloo focuses around 3 core characters. Mugen is a straight loud mouth anti-hero. Mugen is the wild one of the group, always flying by the seat of his pants. Mugen also seems to have a problem with authority. Mugen is the first to draw and the last to leave a fight. Jin is a noble ronin in the search of a purpose. Jin although quite and wise, he too has some distaste with authority like Mugen, although with different reason mainly because he sees the one’s in charge as waste. Fuu is a young girl in the search of a samurai who smells of sunflowers, she keeps these reasons to herself for some reason. Fuu is clumsy and some times naive. Fuu is constantly being kidnapped even though she has two strong bodyguards. And for some reason she keeps a flying squirrel with her to help out sometimes.\\nEnjoyment\\nAny one who is a fan of samurai action will surely like Champloo. Filled with enough action to keep those hard core action fans at bay, Champloo sprinkles some comedy and drama on top. If you are someone who doesn't like the hip-hop aspect of Champloo, then at least give it a try, you may be surprised.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '322fac5a34d734afad94e810b3724e16'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Historical anime don't usually interest me, but when it's as tongue-in-cheek and as full of anachronisms as this, I'm not sure it really counts as a historical anime anymore.\\nSTORY - Like its predecessor Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is a very episodic series, and it's perfectly safe to miss a few episodes here or there. Even the overarching story remains incredibly vague for almost the entirety of the series and the audience is sometimes left to wonder if there really is a point to all of that searching when they knew virtually nothing to begin with. There's something about the lack of details that makes this\\nstory appealing though -- it never seems that important, so you just continue along, but deep in the back of your head, you remain curious about it. So it's the perfect situation; there's immediate gratification within each mostly-standalone episode, but there's also the thread that ties all of those little adventures together, and in the end, there is an ending.\\nCHARACTER - As with many other slice-of-life or episodic series, much of the entertainment relies on the characters, and herein is a very strong point for the series. All three of our protagonists are rich, interesting characters with backstories that don't seem to clash with their general personalities. As strangers that all met coincidentally in the first episode, their histories are gradually revealed throughout the course of the series in a perfectly paced, even casual way. Though this involves a bunch of chance encounters with figures from their respective pasts, none of them ever really seem to intrude upon the story for the sole purpose of explaining things, which is great. And their stories all actually do contribute to their personalities as a whole, making them all fully-rounded characters with an enjoyable amount of depth to them.\\nThe characters also really contribute to the sometimes satirical nature of the series. Jin could be, at first glance, your stereotypical samurai. Or maybe he really just is, but the fact that they poke fun at him for it makes his whole stance all the more questionable. Mugen is just ridiculous; after all, his fighting technique is rooted in break dancing. And Fuu... well, I suppose Fuu is the least notable of them all, though I sort of feel like I can conclude her a mockery of typical women in samurai anime if I'd seen more samurai anime. Even given the normalcy of her character, she has enough emotion and perseverance to keep her from being called flat.\\nARTSTYLE & ARTWORK - Given the time period of the series and all the anachronistic elements, Champloo's art style is very fun and unique. The opening and ending sequences are a great example already. The blending of modern ideas with such a traditional setting is brilliant and very interesting to see. One of the best examples within the series would probably be the graffiti episodes, where yes, there's totally a town in feudal Japan with a street graffiti problem and two rival gangs that won't stop tagging everything. The animation itself is of good quality throughout and it's definitely an aesthetically pleasing series.\\nMUSIC - The music in Champloo suits it perfectly with its clash of ancient and modern, traditional Japanese folk music and present-day hip hop. The opening and ending themes are also wonderfully appropriate to many aspects of the series.\\nVOICE ACTING - I've seen both the sub and dub, and I must say, both are quite excellent. While I wouldn't necessarily venture to say that the dub is better than the sub (as was certainly the case with Bebop), it definitely stands on at least the same level. Dub-wise, it might have been the easy choice to cast Steve Blum as Mugen, considering Spike Spiegel and Mugen not only had similar personalities, but also looked similar, but damn, the man sure does the job well. (Admission of bias: I love Steve Blum's voice.) Jin's and Fuu's English voices were also quite awesome and actually sounded rather similar to their Japanese counterparts. The characters introduced in each episode also maintained above average voices for the most part, with appropriately sinister voices for the sinister and bumbling voices for the bumbling. All expressed emotion well and were generally convincing all around.\\nOVERALL - Samurai Champloo was a very fun series. Almost all the episodes were excellent in themselves with a great story, as well as great technical aspects. But the overarching story, when it finally did come together in the end, was actually really nice too. And simple as the ending was, I liked it, was satisfied, and thought it was worth it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '50361ca2f2863749d310263369414c61'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'For anyone who has watched Cowboy Bebop, they know that director Shinichiro Watanabe loves blending completely disparate elements together, be it science fiction, physical comedy, spaghetti Western, bebop jazz, or space epic, all into the same story.\\nAs diverse as \"Cowboy Bebop\" was, it has nothing on the sheer schizophrenia of \"Samurai Champloo\", Watanabe\\'s most recent effort. On the surface, it\\'s a mixture of comedy and samurai epic about Japan in the mid 1600s. However, that doesn\\'t do the series any more justice than calling \"Cowboy Bebop\" a space western.\\nOne episode is a Shaolin Soccer-esque comedy about a baseball game. Another is a zombie horror story\\nwhich doubles as an allegory for World War 2. The series presents historically accurate facts about the spread of Christianity in Japan side-by-side with rocket launchers, talks about Edo-style painting and Vincent Van Gogh in the same episode as punks with switchblades and green mohawks.\\nThere are young street gangs painting graffiti, near-invincible blind warriors modeled upon Zaotichi, honorable samurai warriors, arrogant fashion designers, mid 17th century Japanese beat boxing rappers, and eating competitions.\\nHip-hop and rap music is as prominent as traditional Japanese and Aina-style music.\\nMost directors attempting such a crazy mix would be met with failure and ridicule. However, Shinichiro Watanabe manages to succeed, and he does so thanks to several different elements;\\n1. Comedy- Samurai Champloo might well be the funniest anime series I\\'ve ever seen. Whether it be over-the-top action scenes, great situational comedy, or the absurdity of so many different elements in the same time period and place, there are certain moments in the series that will have one gasping for air.\\n2. A hard, brutal, uncompromising story- The above works especially well because of how gritty, bloody, and tragic the majority of the story is. Most of the characters die. There is rarely a happy ending. Even in the instances when the good guys \"win\", it\\'s not clear whether they\\'re better off than they were originally.\\n3. Misdirection- In every series or movie, a director can leave lots of minor hints and clues about what\\'s going to happen. Most of the time they are fulfilled. In this series, though, Watanabe does the exact opposite of what one is expecting.\\nA small example of this is when an old man is giving one of the samurai protagonists, Jin, a lecture about going with the current to catch a fish. The man is clearly wise, the music becomes serious, and like lightning, his hands dart through the pristine, blue river. His hands rise above his head, clenched hard, golden in the light of the sun.\\nSuddenly, the record scratches, the man opens his hand, and it turns out there\\'s no fish.\\n\"Well, sometimes they get away, anyhow!\" the man exclaims with a laugh.\\nThere are dozens of such examples throughout the series. The ending is probably the best case of misdirection, being the complete opposite of what I expected.\\n4. Memorable characters- While the former pirate and violent vagrant Mugen is probably the star of the show, and the source of most of the laughs, he does not completely outshine straightman, and traditional, honorable samurai Jin, who is every bit as interesting of a character, and provides plenty laughs of his own. Even Fuu, the girl guiding them, isn\\'t the typical annoying Japanese anime heroine, and is a great set-up and comedic foil for the two mismatched warriors.\\nThis series is an absolute classic, my favorite anime ever.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8ce9687b839b681e29539200f3819e6c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Overview:\\nCowboy Bebop is one of my favorite anime of all time, but what about Bebop's little brother, Samurai Champloo? Honestly...I felt that Champloo was a crushing disappointment and really isn't that good in comparison. I know that isn't a popular opinion to state, but it is truthfully how I feel. Now I am going to analyze this series in depth to further elaborate.\\nStory: 7/10\\nThe story is that a little girl named Fu is wandering around trying to find a mysterious samurai that smells of sunflowers. On her journey, she meets the cool headed Jin and the Wildman Mugen. Jin fights with a traditional kenjutsu style,\\nwhile Mugen integrates hip hop break dancing into his fighting style. Basically, he fights like Eddy Gordo from the Tekken series when some n00b is just mashing buttons. The plot is largely episodic much like Bebop, but the episodes aren’t nearly as interesting as the ones from Bebop. The main storyline is also quite a large leap backwards for Watanabe when compared to Bebop’s main story. Champloo tries to integrate chunks of Japanese history and traditional Japanese culture with American pop culture, especially rap and hip hop culture. This was a very ambitious and bold idea that could have worked, but I didn’t think it was executed in this series very well. The anime also touches on Christianity and its impact on Japanese history. Christianity is certainly handled by Watanabe with a LOT more care and respect than some other anime directors. I’m looking at you Anno!\\nCharacters: 7/10\\nThe characters are really pretty bland compared the memorable cast from Bebop. Jin and Mugen simply aren’t as cool or as likeable as Spike, Fu isn’t as awesome as Ed or Fay, and there is no villain with anywhere near the level of badass that Vicious brought. Having said all that, the characters aren’t terrible when compared to the average anime. They just can’t match up with the ones Watanabe created in his previous work. I did like how Jin and Mugen had the classic Red Oni/Blue Oni dynamic going on. Other than that, the character relations really didn’t interest me to a great degree. Even Fu’s relation with her father just didn’t feel that interesting.\\nArt: 8/10\\nThe art is actually very good. I would say the art is by far the highlight of the series. The animation looks smooth and the series has aged quite well. No complaints here!\\nSound: 3/10\\nOne major difference between Bebop and Champloo is the choice of soundtrack: Jazz vs. rap. This is obviously a matter of personal taste, but I like Jazz in general more than I like rap. This is amplified quite a bit when the Jazz and Rap in competition is Yoko Kanno’s masterful Jazz OST vs. some very mediocre J-rap. Whereas Kanno’s use of big band Jazz in the style of Duke Ellington was highly impressive, the rap in Champloo is only a notch above the skill and quality of Mike Jones. If you don’t know who Mike Jones is…just type it into youtube. You can hate me later for introducing you to his “music”.\\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\nI enjoyed some episodes a lot more than I enjoyed others. I appreciate what the series was trying so hard to do, but I just couldn’t bring myself to actually enjoy it, no matter how much I wanted to.\\nOverall: 6/10  (7+7+8+3+5)/ 5 = 6\\nSamurai Champloo is by no means a bad anime series that you should avoid watching at all costs. That is NOT what I am trying to say. What I am saying is that it isn’t a particularly good series and it is a HUGE let down for fans of Bebop. If you want an anime with samurai, lots of rap, and a cross between Japanese and American hip hop culture, I would go with Afro Samurai. It is far superior to Samurai Champloo.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f0c84407dd3358a7ca103daa1e8160f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"The premise is simple, three complete strangers drawn together by fate to embark on a long, very parlous journey across unfamiliar territory. However, it's not the plot which makes Samurai Champloo note worthy, but rather the characters themselves. There is a very strong relate-ability present in the main characters Jin, Mugen and Fuu; no matter who the viewer happens to be it's a more than safe bet they will instantly find common ground with at least one if not all three. This element within it's self is the very one which drives the series forward, it offers added interest and added suspense as each of\\nour three travailing companions find themselves in some rather tense situations quite regularly. The true paradox in Samurai Champloo is that it's actually the main characters' normality which makes them so extraordinary.\\nJin is a quiet, very strong willed, mysterious man of few words and it shows through greatly in his swordsmanship. Gin fights the same way he lives, with decisiveness, with great resolve, and with honor. Jin is a man of tradition, and a man of respect. It comes as no surprise he isn't one to allow someone under his skin during the heat of battle, he remains un-rattled and content with his abilities even in times of great adversities.\\nMugen can easily be considered Jin's polar opposite; unlike Jin, Mugen has no concept of reserve, always speaks his mind despite the outcome, he is an extremely reckless individual who is easily the most cut throat free spirit in existence. Mugen inadvertently thrives off of defying the laws and 'order' around him, but in reality he's simply seeking an opponent who he feels would prove as a worthy match for his skill and ability. There are some who claim they'd laugh in the face of death, Mugen would beat each and every one of you to it.\\nFuu is unlike either of the two samurai who accompany her. Although she's a bit of a klutz and slightly clueless at times, Fuu proves to be a lot more cunning and determined than first impressions are willing to let on. Fuu is the type of girl who once her mind is made up, nothing except death could stop her from chasing and attempting to reach her goals and aspirations, but like everyone, some times she just needs a bit of motivation.\\nSamurai Champloo is able to excel where most other series fail, it's ability to balance both comedic elements with serious, very deep subject matter is a direct result of the characters themselves. Nothing seems forced, every line of dialog is believable, everything seems to fit with the personality, actions and dominate traits Jin, Mugen and Fuu possess; although most would think this should be expected, it's not an easy feat to accomplish. The multi dimensional perspective of Jin, Mugen, and Fuu's outward actions, as well as inner feelings more than make up for the lack of complexity in the story's plot. After all, who here hasn't seen an anime about samurai?\\nMost importantly this series left me fulfilled, it didn't leave any questions unanswered, and to me the ending, although somewhat anti climatic was in my opinion a more than suited one to close the final pages on what is one of my favorite animes of all time. You'll laugh, maybe even cry and through it all you'll enjoy every minute of it, and chances are you'll want to experience it all over again in the not to distant future.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f7b1f8b8cfaca1708b147da0dc24fac6'}>,\n",

which supports my next statement).\\xa0\\xa0But this merely pretext for Mr. Watanabe to display his full arsenal of talent by taking historical events and flipping them on their head.\\xa0\\xa0All the while sprinkling in fluid samurai fights that are sparse on exposition, and heavy on blood spattering (Shonen anime could learn a thing or two).\\xa0\\xa0Because Samurai Champloo is absent of an end goal, it was paramount for its characters — Mugen, Jin, and Fuu — to be more than a mere vehicle to reach the proverbial ‘end-goal,’ and to be the story, itself.\\xa0\\xa0A story about the human experience and the futility of life.\\nMugen represent the future, as his baggy clothes, employment of free-flowing dance moves, curt demeanor, passion for graffiti, infatuation with sex and willingness to get drunk or ‘stoned’ are reminiscent of a 90’s or early 2000’s rapper.\\xa0\\xa0As such, his movements seem random, but his flow is crisp.\\xa0\\xa0Whether it’s to repel an attack with his geta (Japanese wooden shoes; fitted with metal strips, in Mugen’s case) or slice his opponent to pieces, each movement glides to the next.\\xa0\\xa0Perhaps he needlessly waste effort performing these complex ‘dance’ moves.\\xa0\\xa0Perhaps his swordplay looks ridiculously to a\\xa0\\xa0trained samurai.\\xa0\\xa0Perhaps he is not respected his peers, or humanity.\\xa0\\xa0But his ‘futuristic’ ideals align with a\\xa0\\xa0generation of apathetic youth who do not care about what’s ‘right’ or ‘acceptable.’\\xa0\\xa0Or, as Conner Mcgregor stated, “I just don’t give a f—k!”\\xa0\\xa0Mugen lives a bohemian lifestyle in which he does what he wants, when he wants — and damn the consequences.\\xa0\\xa0He embraces chaos; in fact, he thrives on it.\\xa0\\xa0Hence his eagerness to stir the pot of life to stimulate anger in others.\\xa0\\xa0Mugen is the proverbial Joker to Jin’s Batman.\\xa0\\xa0A counterweight that explores all the possibilities of the world via the notion that rules are a human contrivance, and only serves to inhibit one’s creativity.\\xa0\\xa0He is unique unto himself.\\xa0\\xa0Making him the perfect juxtaposition to Jin, a samurai who is entirely stuck in his ways.\\nJin embodies the ‘past.’\\xa0\\xa0His restrained demeanor and adherence to strict rules are indicative of this fact.\\xa0\\xa0Even in a state of extreme hunger, he will refrain from theft; feeling obliged to reimburse whoever it is that gave him food.\\xa0\\xa0His sword style is that of a fish: quick, technical, and efficient.\\xa0\\xa0He relies on the teachings of his elders, but refines his skills to a razor’s edged.\\xa0\\xa0Due to his rigid, antiquated ideals, he feels out of place in the ‘wild west’ of ronin.\\xa0\\xa0Hence his disdain for samurai who ‘prostitute’ themselves to affluent conmen who debase the martial arts by using the samurai as mere muscle.\\xa0\\xa0Thus, Jin’s unwillingness to accept full-time employment.\\xa0\\xa0In this regard, Mugen and Jin are similar — as they both loathe the samurai who denigrate themselves, by allowing someone to rule over them.\\xa0\\xa0One commonality, however, is not enough to achieve camaraderie.\\xa0\\xa0This is where the ‘Present’ comes in.\\nFuu achieves cooperation between the fiery Mugen and the ice-cold Jin — albeit, reluctantly — via keeping them preoccupied with their search for the samurai that smells of sunflowers.\\xa0\\xa0A task that seems inconsequential as the show proceeds; nevertheless, it gives the three an opportunity to form a bond with one another.\\xa0\\xa0In their search for the cryptic samurai, the begin to accept one another, and even form a friendship.\\xa0\\xa0Though their friendship is faint from a surface level, it is easily discernible in a moment of peril.\\xa0\\xa0Numerous times throughout the series, Mugen and/or Jin will rescue Fuu from a hazardous situation without a second thought.\\xa0\\xa0A far-cry from the first episode when Mugen needed to be bribed with dumplings to aid Fuu.\\nThat, in my opinion, is what Samurai Champloo is all about.\\xa0\\xa0A character study on the bending — but not breaking — human personality.\\xa0\\xa0We can sort-of alter different aspects about ourselves through the influence of others; yet, in the end, we are who we are.\\xa0\\xa0Mugen, while developing a companionship with Jin and Fuu (and possibly a love interest with the latter), is still a bombastic, slice first, ask questions never kind-of-guy.\\xa0\\xa0Because his past is mired in deceit, he trusts no one.\\xa0\\xa0Causing him to be a pirate captain in a proverbial sea of loneliness.\\xa0\\xa0And while Fuu and Jin bring him closer to the shore, he still remains emotionally inaccessible till the end.\\nJin remains a calm, level-headed spirit, even though he risked his life numerous times for his companions.\\xa0\\xa0Even when he seems to be developing a relationship with Shino, he pushes her away, and decides to live in solitude.\\xa0\\xa0And Fuu maintains her spunky optimism despite being forced into a whore house, taken hostage (multiple times!), and being told she has no sex appeal.\\nIn terms of the conclusion, western audiences may be taken back by the absence of a ‘happy ending,’ but life rarely ends with a neat little bow.\\xa0\\xa0The ending is also a commentary on the individuality of existence.\\xa0\\xa0We bond with people for transient moments in time and then it ends, and we move on;

But most importantly, a legendary soundtrack.\\nStory: 9\\nThe story is very easy. A girl named Fuu is searching for a samurai that smells like sunflowers and Jin and Mugen are helping her.

It is more\\na relaxing story that is a little bit slow paced but got some of the best episodes in anime history with some really good plots and in the end a stunning, exciting main plot like Cowboy Bebop.\\nOne weak point is that there are a few filler episodes where not much happens. I think the episodes are mostly relaxing between the breathtaking episodes because the characters are very good and very enjoying (like Gintama\\'s filler episodes).\\nCharacter: 10\\nThese three main characters are one of these perfect trios.\\nYou got Mugen who is a very sharp, badass guy and is just doing what he wants and a little bit dumb, also he is very skilled with his katana.\\nYou got Jin who is a chill, warmhearted guy but he doesn\\'t give a damn about anything and just wants to live a quiet life.\\nYou got Fuu who is a chill girl, who can be annoying sometimes but she is determined and is the \"leader\" of the trio (of course Jin and Mugen don\\'t care).\\nThese three characters form a perfect trio and you will have a really good time with them.\\nThe antagonists are insane. They are all different, some are badass, some are annoying and there are 2 antagonists that are very thrilling got a mysterious backstory.\\nTo sum up: they all are some of the best characters and you will love them.\\nSound: 10+\\nNow to my favourite part of Samurai Champloo: the soundtrack. Why?\\nThe soundtracks are Lo-Fi Hip/Hop beats by Nujabes and Fat Jon. Just listen to them, they are some of the best OSTs in anime.\\nIf there is a relaxing scene, a thrilling scene, a funny scene or an exciting scene... you will always enjoy the smooth Lo-Fi tracks.\\nThe OP is great and the Ending is in my Top 3 of my favourite Endings.\\nAlso, there is a theme in a plot scene that is bonechilling.\\nThe soundtrack improves the anime on a different level.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Samurai Champloo is frequently compared to Cowboy Bebop, but there's one thing that really sets it apart: the action. There wasn't anything bad about Bebop's action, but Champloo's action is among the best of any anime out there, especially among TV series. Though the main characters both use swords, they fight with wildly different styles (Mugen's use of shoes is particularly brilliant), and the fights against enemies with various weapons throughout the series all manage to make themselves interesting and different. Even if the rest of the series were terrible, it would be worth watching simply for the action.\\nBut the rest of the series manages\\nto be entertaining as well. The main story's not anything special, but the stories told in individual episodes range from hilarious to heartbreaking. Each story is genuinely unpredictable due to the bloody nature of the series, and you can never tell whether the encounter's going to end well or not. That's not to say that the show revels in violence for the sake of violence, as conflicts are frequently solved peacefully as well.\\nThe main characters themselves are all solid, but where they truly shine is in their interactions with other characters. The series is never content to just follow one character's story. All three of the characters will often split up, meet separate characters, and go through development of their own while the tertiary characters develop as well. Sometimes the stories will all be related, while other times they share only thematic links, but this structure keeps the show interesting and fast-paced at all times.\\nThe style of the show likewise contributes to making everything more interesting. The artstyle is gorgeous, and the animation is always pretty. More important is the way hip-hop themes are integrated into the show. I'm not a fan of hip-hop in general, but the style here is absolutely perfect, contributing greatly to the humor of the show. It never dominates an episode completely, but it provides little touches that make otherwise ordinary characters and scenes special. A rumor might be told as a rap, and the episode might otherwise be completely devoid of hip-hop references. The music does have some hip-hop influences, but they never dominate the score, so don't worry that you'll dislike the music if you don't like hip-hop.\\nThe humor of the show in general is likewise top-notch. The comedy episodes are some of the best in the show, partly because they tackle serious themes (such as Japan being invaded) in very comical ways. These episodes are also just as violent as the rest of the show, and include the same hip-hop styling to make things stay fun. Mugen is frequently the source of most of the laughs, but Fuu and Jin also frequently amuse, as does the side cast. Even the serious episodes often have jokes at very inappropriate times, and because of the style of the show, those jokes work.\\nI watched Samurai Champloo for the action, but every other aspect of the show completely surpassed my expectations. While I wouldn't call it perfect, as one or two of the episodes aren't very good and only a few are truly exceptional, I will say that I was never bored, and I usually had a smile on my face.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Fuu is a young orphaned girl doing her best to survive while working in a teashop. But her world as she knows it begins to unravel the minute a wandering Okinawan swordsman by the name of Mugen slouches into the shop while the daikon's abusive son and his rude cronies are also having some fun. When Fuu becomes the victim of their nasty games, she immediately offers Mugen fifty dango if he saves her from them. At the same time, a masterless samurai named Jin bears witness to the daikon's cruelty and quickly intervenes, easily dispatching the daikon's &quot;best of the best&quot; guards. Mugen also\\nbeats everyone in the teashop up, starting with cutting off the arm of the man threatening Fuu, and demands better opponents from the daikon's son.\\nJin wanders in after the lordling threatens Mugen with his father's elite guard, unaware that Jin has already taught them all a lesson. Mugen mistakes Jin for the &quot;really strong&quot; warriors but is quickly corrected. It makes no difference because Jin is now the strongest opponent available. To Fuu's chagrin, the pair of them immediately decide to duke it out in her teashop. The fight, however, ends abruptly when the man whose arm Mugen has just chopped off sets the place on fire.\\nThat is how the story starts, and how three strange, wildly different people get together.  Due to a strange series of events, Fuu has contracted both Mugen and Jin tol help her find the mysterious &quot;samurai who smells of sunflowers&quot;. But how long can a young girl keep a pair of battle-crazy swordsmen under control, and how can they find a samurai by his scent alone (especially when Mugen doesn't even know what a sunlower is)?\\nSamurai Champloo is Shinichiro Watanabe's next great animated venture that came right on the heels of Cowboy Bebop. It's quite funny and insane and just as initially apparently plotless as Bebop but once again proves to be a masterpiece in character studies. Unlike Bebop (which I can't help comparing Champloo to), there isn't much of an overarching plot. Though Fuu's quest to find the mysterious sunflower samurai is the main plot point, it isn't as heavy or deep or as present as the Spike/Vicious conflict throughout Bebop. Most of the time, it's just Jin, Mugen, and Fuu wandering across Japan, getting into trouble, starving, almost dying, and fighting with random people for no true purpose. It is occasionally dramatic, sometimes gory, and frequently violent, but it is never too heavy. It's more entertainment than actual story, although there are several stories and themes that intertwine.\\nThe art is breathtaking, of course. The landscapes and backgrounds are so amazingly beautiful and complete while animation is dazzlingly fluid. The fight scenes are absolutely excellent and exciting. The music appears inappropriate in theory but sounds perfect in actuality. Hip-hop and lounge music in a samurai anime? Was the director on crack? Not really. Just brilliant. With artists such as Tsutchie and NUJABES on board, the soundtrack is unexpectedly fitting and over-all quite good.\\nMy final verdict is: it's a good and entertaining anime but lacks the depth that made Cowboy Bebop a masterpiece. Still, I wouldn't pass Champloo up. The characters and setting are just too awesome and realistically done. However, some aspects of the stories and humor may be hard to grasp, as they are much too deeply rooted in Japanese history to easily translate or understand. And if you're one of those people who think that, after seeing one samurai anime, you've seen them all - trust me. You haven't. Samurai Champloo has it faults, certainly, but it is most definitely unique.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ea82112ed904be260f3208d8921e7e9b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I promised to some friends that some day I would do a review on Samurai Champloo.\\nAnd well, since the dough for the Nikuman is still rising, I might as well do this now. So, where to start?\\nFirst of all, if you visit my profile you'll find out rather quickly that I'm not a big fan of Watanabe Shinichiro. Or his works. Still, I try to rate it as objective as possible. So, lets get started already.\\nThe first point on my list would be the story aspect, which I split up in three sections (something I'll do for every category, be prepared): The actual story, the\\nsetting used, as well as the execution of said story.\\nStory 2/3: As you know from the synopsis, Fuu is searching for a 'samurai that smells like sunflowers'. Why she does that is left in the dark at first, but is a pretty promising start. It leaves a lot of options where to go with the story, and grabs your attention. On the other hand, this plot isn't anything special either, we have seen this plot before, and I can guarantee, we will see it again.\\nSetting 1/3: I am a weaboo. And I f'n love japan, I love the Sengoku era, I love the Meiji era, so what could possibly go wrong, right? To be honest, while I like this time setting, I never felt like Watanabe made much use of it. It might as well have played in renaissance europe, or in space, or in medieval america or parts-unknown. It wouldn't make any difference to the story except the samurai being a knight, panther warrior, astronaut or whatever.\\nExecution 1/3: Just like in Cowboy Bebop Watanabe nearly spends no time on developing his characters or story, but instead focusses on pointing out the differences between that time depicted and our own time, which he describes as better (Sidenote: Our time is not better than the past, each time has its own problems to tackle. But this is a discussion for some other time).\\nThe story is mostly episodic, with moreoften than not episodes, which absolutely do nothing to the overaching plot. So overall, lots of episodes felt to me like a total waste of time.\\nSo the overall story score is 5/10 (No, this is no error)\\nThe Art. This section contains the character designs, the Backgrounds, as well as the fluency of animation (especially in battlescenes).\\nCharacter designs 1/3: To be honest, the character designs are the worst part of this anime, because quite frankly, they look unproportional. Especially Fuu's and Jin's heads.\\nI feel like Jins head is way too thin for his body, while Fuu on the other hand has a rather broad head. Your typical head would be like 1/3 of the shoulders, but Fuu's head is big enough to fill over half of her shoulders. Jins head on the other hand is thin enough to only take 1/4 to 1/5 of his shoulders. This looks really weird (for reference, I took ep 25 7:17 as example).\\nAlso, in contrast to the background the characters are quite pale, with their skin being nearly white. The characters are (thats hard to describe, I hope I can get this across correctly) outlined pretty sharply, so they look like cut-out figures running over a paining. Which is a rather good transition...\\nBackground 2/3: ...because the background seems like a drawn painting which uses oil colors. Well, I'm not much of an artist though. Why is it not full score? Because I miss some clear contures. Even on distances like 10 meters or so, most objects are depicted as rough outlinings.\\nAnimation 2/3: This is probably the point I pondered on the most. So I will start the simple part. Outside of battlescenes the animation is just as good, as you'd expect. It isn't mindblowingly good, but it does it job. But now the fightingscenes... (again, I took ep 25 as reference) For some of the scenes I were pondering whether this is 2 or 3 points, and for some I were pondering whether I give 1 or 2 points... First of, the battle scenes are rather americanized. What does that mean, you wonder? The battleanimations certainly look flashy and all, but to a point where they sacrificed realism for action. Pretty much the same way as Hollywood does on a regular basis. As a kendoka myself, I obviously disliked that fact. Scenes I remember clearly are for example running on the sides of buildings, cutting whole stones with a kama, or single animated strikes with 3 or more after images of attacks. Don't get me wrong, other anime do this, too. But those aren't set in a (pseudo)realistic Meiji-era japan.\\nThats not too shabby for the art works at least, 6/10.\\nThe soundscore is pretty obvious. Voice acting (since I nearly never watch dubs, I'm just rating the japanese ones), BGM/OST, and OP/ED.\\nVoice acting 2/3: With Saber as one of my favorites one would think, that I throw all rationalism out of my window right now, but unfortunately I dislike Kawasumi Ayako in her role as 'Damsel in distress'. It doesn't really fit her image, but obviously she's a good enough voice actress to make it at least work. Nakai Kazuya on the other hand is just as great as always. I mainly remember him from Gintama (Hijikata), and well... there is absolutely nothing I could criticize here. He hits the role of Mugen perfectly. Period. Sato Ginpei on the other hand is rather unexperienced, and for his particular role he works pretty well. He doesn't seem to emotional, but I can't remember Jin having emotional lines to begin with... Same for the rest of the cast, they definitely do their job good enough to not drag down the anime, but they don't blow off my head either.\\nBGM/OST 0/3: I think I should mention this first - I.am.not.a.Hip-hop.Fan. Now it's out. Nonetheless. Anime like Peace Maker Kurogane prooved for me that Hiphop-Meiji is a viable combination, if used correctly. And as you already can guess from 'if used correcty' I don't think that Samurai Champloo did a good job with it's OST. Rather than supporting the themes or situations of the anime, the OST just went off and did its own thing. To put it simply, I felt like watching an anime, while at the same time having a random Hiphop CD in my CD Player. The music and the pictures were never in sync, at least thats what I feel like. Especially as fighting themes the BGM used felt really misplaced (I don't even need to write this anymore, but again ep 25).\\nOP/ED 1/3: As mentioned earlier, Hiphop and Meiji is viable. Unfortunately I seriously disliked the OP 'Battlecry'. So much, that at some point I started skipping it. However, even though it is not my taste, I feel like it fits the anime. The EDs on the other hand are more to my taste, even if just by a small margin. Still, I rarely listened to any of those, so I won't dwell to long on this.\\nOf course, the score went a bit down because music taste is subjective, but I think I tried my best to stay more on the objective side of things. Overall 4/10 for the Sound.\\nNext is the characters-section... Short spoiler, I never came to like any of those characters.\\nHowever. I rate for the initial character design, their development (both characters and relationships), as well as the relation/interaction between the characters.\\nInitial character design 2/3: The anime starts with a cast of three completely different characters. Ditzy Fuu, mysterious Jin, and wild Mugen. They all have their points of interest, vived backgrounds, and are overall well rounded. Again though, without blowing your head off of excitement. The same goes for the introduced side characters. the episodes in which they appear deliver adequate information on their backgrounds, as well as reasons etc.\\nDevelopment 1/3: I... just wanted to write something witty, but I can't come up with anything! To be honest, if I compare the start and end traits of the characters and relations I reach just one conclusion: Next to nothing changed. Don't get me wrong, they definitely developed, but I don't feel like they would act different from before.\\nRelations 2/3: Well, I already mentioned that all of the maincharacters act and think completely different. This obviously ends up in pretty interesting interactions as well. Unfortunately those interactions are as old as anime. Or even older. None of the situations are new or groundbreaking, but they are not bad either.\\nSo overall, its 6/10. (I don't want to compare the cast of Champloo and Bebop, which is pretty much identical)\\nFinally, my Enjoyment. This is the only section which is, and always will be, completely subjective. I decide on how much I liked what I saw, how much I want a continuition (or in ongoing anime how much I look forward to the next episode), whether or not I would recommend it to friends, and whether I would woatch it again (and how often i would watch it again).\\nSo, much ado about nothing...\\nDid I like it? No.\\nDo I want a continuiton? No.\\nDo I recommend it? Depends on who asks me, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people I know at least.\\nWould I watch it again? Please.\\nSo, Enjoyment ist pretty much 1/10. I can't remember myself even smiling once during this anime.\\nBut here's the point. I don't really feel like rate something bad, just because I dislike it.\\nFor the overall rating I won't use my own Enjoyment, but an average of 5 pts.\\nJust for reference, an enjoyment of 1 would result in an Overall score of 4.4, the maximum enjoyment would result in an Overall score of 6.2.\\nAs usual I appreciate feedback to improve my reviews.\\nAnd now, my dough is done, time to eat.\\nOh, tl;dr:\\nStory 5/10 - Mediocre story of a girl searching a certain person.\\nArt 6/10 - Fluent animation with unrealistic movement\\nSound 4/10 - Good voiceacting, but no synergy of sound and picture\\nChar 6/10 - Well round cast, without much development.\\nEnjoy depends on watcher.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9b0e7813c321c3007f5a6612f45d8558'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Story:\\nThe story has a main central plot. Two samurai (although I think Mugen shouldn't really be considered a traditional samurai) and a teahouse waitress meet and the swordsmen end up accompanying her on a journey to seek out the samurai who smells of sunflowers. However, each episode, or occasionally every two episodes, really has its own story, but still falls into the main storyline perfectly because these episode stories are really the stories of their travels.\\nIn the beginning the whole sunflower samurai thing was somewhat vague and unexplained, but the truth of it becomes revealed throughout the series. I think it was a great story\\nthat was well developed and the ending was actually pretty good in my opinion. It really didn't leave you hanging at all because the main storyline was entirely resolved (despite what the idiots who believe it wasn't resolved say.)\\nThis story takes place in Japan's Edo Period (1603-1868,) however is really a revisionist historical series, meaning that the makers added some modern day elements that are anachronistic, predominately because the show contains hip-hop cultural attributes (i.e. break dancing, turntables, graffiti, Mugen's style, etc.) Also baseball did not arrive to Japan until 1878, ten years after the end of the Edo era, but the episode that contains a baseball game does fabricate a story that would make it possible. On the other hand, it does still actually show a lot of Edo historical aspects (such as the persecution against Christians, the nation's restriction of foreign affairs, Ukiyo-e paintings, and even a fictionalized version of a real life samurai (Miyamoto Musashi.) This blend of historical traits mixed with some modern themes makes the show very enjoyable.\\nArt:\\nSuperb. The art style was very cool and the animation was nicely done. Consistently, throughout the whole series that is, the art was great, showing that they didn't slack off and really wanted to do a good job with this. The fighting scenes were brilliantly animated and always fluent, and the variety of camera angles and movements made it all very exciting.\\nSound:\\nYes, outstanding, definitely. The music is meant to reflect the hip-hop genre, and it does so very well. The OP is a cool song that fits the style as well as the samurai theme of the series. The ED is also a nice song for the show, and on several episodes there is an alternate ED, and then it goes back to the main ED, so the changes every once in a while are nice.\\nThe background music is top notch, especially during the action sequences. The music gets you so into the feel of the battle and makes it quite exciting. The sound effects are awesome. In the middle of the episodes when that screen shows up that says Samurai Champloo (where like a commercial would usually be,) as well during the actual episodes when one scene changes to another, there are cool sound effects like turntables and such that further add to the hip-hop feel.\\nThere's all this talk about the hip-hop, but maybe you don't like hip-hop. However, trust me, it makes the show so enjoyable and adds greatly to the overall feel of the show, generating a remarkable outcome.\\nCharacter:\\nThe show primarily revolves around three characters: Fuu, Mugen, and Jin.\\nFuu is a 15 year old girl who lost her mother to illness and was always told she never had a father. Thus, at the start of the show, she was alone working as a waitress at a teahouse. It is her goal to find the samurai who smells like sunflowers, for a reason I can't disclose because I believe it'd be considered a spoiler. She loves to eat despite her small stature often bickers primarily with Mugen.\\nMugen is a swordsman who really helps give off the hip-hop feel. His fighting style incorporates a break dancing like art with swordsmanship, making it very cool, original, and enjoyable to watch. At the start of the show he's displayed as a lone wolf sorta guy who is a troublemaker always on the hunt for a tougher opponent.  Anything about his parents or family is basically unknown to him, however the focal point of his history is revealed, which is enough to satisfy the viewer.\\nJin is more of a classical, orthodox, and traditional samurai. He remains as a rather cryptic and sophisticated type of dude. Always being more calm and quiet, he differs greatly with Mugen, which is great. However, their sword skills are equal, and thus they agree that after their journey with Fuu is complete they would kill each other. Jin's history, like Mugen's, isn't given to you in its entirety, however I think more than enough is given about him, telling you basically what you need to know.\\nThe contrasting personalities and styles of this trio makes the story extremely enjoyable because it always creates great comedy and humor. I think everybody could come to love these characters due to their separate traits. The supporting characters are usually pretty interesting and perform their roles nicely, all that is needed for a supporting character really.\\nEnjoyment:\\nUnique and top-notch samurai sword fighting mixed with other weapons such as kusarigamas and the occasional firearm. Great humor produced by three significantly different characters. A story that every episode keeps you occupied and drawn in. A wonderful soundtrack and magnificent artwork that boost the quality of the show.\\nWhat more could you ask for in a shounen series? It's a great action show that shouldn't be passed up, if anything simply for how incredibly enjoyable it is.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '815eb15b77e1cb6a1f7fd96c400cb10f'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I am probably one of the very few people that have watched Samurai Champloo before Cowboy Bebop. I find this great as I don\\'t end up comparing the two as they are directed by the same person, Shinchiro Watanabe. Because Cowboy Bebop is highly acclaimed as one of the best Anime out there, it would not help out Champloo\\'s case as it would be frowned upon for not being as good as Cowboy Bebop. Anyways, onto the Review!\\nSamurai Champloo is a 2004 anime directed by Shinchiro Watanabe and produced by studio Manglobe, which follows the story of 3 main protagonists; Mugen, Jin, and Fuu as\\nthey \"coincidentally\" run into each other and set off on Fuu\\'s goal of reaching the \"Samurai that smells of Sunflowers.\" This anime is set in a Fictional Edo period of Japan, with many hip hop elements mixed in with traditional Japanese culture.\\nEven though Champloo does have a main goal, this series is mainly episodic, focusing on the actual journey than the goal itself. This does hurt the story a bit as it feels like the end goal is just a plot element to keep the story going. However, each episode, though rather formulaic at times, is very intriguing with the various people they meet on the way and the various struggles they have. There are also many comedic elements in Champloo, which are for the most part hit and miss. There is one scene in all of Champloo that is pretty hilarious, and you will know what I\\'m talking about.\\nAs someone who has been watching more recent titles, it is hard to judge Champloo as it is a 2004 anime, and production quality has soared since that time. However, you can easily tell that the quality on the animation was top notch at it\\'s time. All the fight scenes are absolutely beautiful, with everything being so smooth and captivating. There are few times when you can notice the quality of the animation drop during less action-oriented scenes, but are fairly rare.\\nSoundwise, Samurai Champloo does something completely different that I personally have never seen in an anime. It\\'s main genre of music is hip hop, with some \"Traditional\" Japanese music thrown in. I myself am not a big fan of Hip Hop, but it does go well with the show, and I did enjoy it for the most part. The opening took a while to get used to, but I now regard it as one of my favourites. The ending is also very catchy, and could even be better than the opening track if Hip Hop isn\\'t in you\\'re musical tastes.\\nThe characters of Samurai Champloo are it\\'s weakest element. You have Mugen, the badass samurai that fights in a completely unorthadox style and takes no shit from nobody. Then we have Jin, who is basically the polar opposite of Mugen, where he is a more traditional samurai and doesn\\'t talk\\nas much, and acts a lot more calm and collected. Then we have Fuu, a girl who gets kidnapped a lot, eats everyone out of house and home, and is completely depended on Mugen and Jin. This is ironic because Fuu is the only one that gets any character development. There is also very little backstory for all of the main protagonists, which is pretty disappointing. I do however like the contrast that Jin and Mugen have with each other, and provides a sort of balance. And even though Mugen\\'s character is static throughout the series, it is just plain fun to watch him spew out profanity and watch his obscure way of fighting.\\nOverall, this anime is just cool. It has many flaws in itself, but the sheer badassery of it all just makes it a fun experience. The whole historical fiction thing might throw a few people off, but I do recommend this quite highly. Thanks for reading my first anime review, I hope you found this helpful!\\n-Furdlegurdle', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '28d30d41b12538c13fd1b06dc3118ca1'}>,\n",

Think of it like this, there is a really awesome old brother who gets laid 24/7 and has lots of money, and there\\'s the nerdy younger brother who still lives with his parents and has no friends.\" - LV69_Squirtle\\n\"i hate to criticize but when you start to compare one anime to another you just can;t enjoy it as much. i watched samurai champloo before cowboy bebop. just ,my humble opinion though\" - apocalipse369\\n\"First of all, sorry for my english. -_-\\'\\nI really enjoyed this anime. There was an entertainment ,truly sad, awesome struggle and just beautiful moments. Champloo is very colourful and rhythmic. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. But story goes the way it should.\\nI love \"Battlecry\" and \"How you feel\" tracks ))\\nComparing to Bebop, Champloo isn\\'t better but... You know even thinking of Spike doing me so sad. Bebop more serious, more adult I guess.\" - freakylem\\n\"Samurai Champloo became one of my favourite series when I watched it. I loved the characters (especially Jin:3) and the incredible action scenes among with the great animation. Storytelling was ok what I remember.. Also I payed attention to the funny, sometimes subtle facial expressions that the characters showed, just like in Cowboy Bebop.\\nThe thing was, I actually didn\\'t know that Bebop was Champloo\\'s predecessor or something until after I had watched the series (meaning Champloo). So, I didn\\'t end up comparing the series with one another while watching Champloo, which was a good thing. ^^\\nIn my opinion, this series is a must-see at least for those who like anime with action and samurais..

       "  <Document: {'content': \"-GODAMNIT ITS BORING-\\n[review by a non fanboy] [contains early game of thrones spoilers]\\nSamurai Champloo, the alleged little brother of the classic anime Cowboy Bebop. Both works rely heavily on music, are episodic and have a very similar feel to them but, if you ask me, Champloo is just Shinichiro Watanabe's bastard and not the good - Jon Snow type but the Tommen Baratheon overly-calm-and-boring type.\\nI generally really like episodic shows; (1)they aren't addictive so you can do things between episodes besides biological functions, (2)the characters' personalitites are well-explored so you get to see many dimensions of their personality, (3)the interactions between the protagonists can be\\nlovingly repetitive without getting annoying and (4)the anime may span many many episodes, i like that. Well, Champloo only (over)does the first of these.\\n1-It's not addictive sure, but for me it was one of the few anime that i felt the need to drop (but i couldn't i'm a completionist); the story was so basic and advanced like a very slow snail. After getting to know the characters and what their adventure was about in the first few episodes, essentially nothing happened until the last 3 episodes or so, except very few episodes that gave some background story about the protagonists or had an interesting supporting character. I get that the show is supposed to be calm and chill but this got to the point of being a total bore.\\n2-The characters personalitites are extremely basic (check their entries they're tiny) to the point that they can be fully described with 2 words. Mugen - Impulsive, Irritable || Jin - Reverse Mugen || Fuu - Hungry, Determined (in that order). Also i have to add that they are all very stubborn. About their past, we learn very basic things, where-what-why leave. People from their past come for 1 episode and dissapear again.\\n3-Well just as the characters themselves, the interactions between them are also very one dimensional and annoyingly repetitive. Typical Interaction: Mugen does something, Fuu reacts to Mugen's action, Jin gives zero fucks.\\n4-Well i do like my anime bigger but this wasn't the case for Samurai Champloo thank god, I would've killed myself if this crap was even 1 episode longer. In this case actually, i think it would have been preferable if this series was shorter, since all those pointless filler episodes would have gone down the drain and the interesting stuff would have remained, making the watching experience actually bearable.\\nOverall an anime with great animation, sound and potential but terrible execution. Tons of filler, unexplored plotlines and a very weak and basic narrative. One of the most boring anime i've seen, only comparable to Gantz and some hentai. I don't recommend watching it but hearing the OST is a good option.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '47caa7962a489022b3f002de7ae5424f'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Well, I don&rsquo;t know how to make this story make any sense to you. You just have to watch it, which I strongly recommend you do. There is humor in pretty much all levels whether gag, otaku reference, slap stick, puns, almost everything. It&rsquo;ll keep you laughing. But if I were to compare the humor with anything, I say Freakazoid is definitely a good foundation of what to expect but times it by 100, and you get this anime. The episodes are less than 10 minutes long since it&rsquo;s based on a short manga that&rsquo;s as long as a Sunday strip so pacing in regards\\nto length isn&rsquo;t a problem. There is some story development, but it takes time but I don&rsquo;t think the purpose of this anime is to develop story and characters at a significant degree, which is why most people love anime, and why it can be hard to get into this one for a critical percentage of anime fans of all levels. But in due time, it will be revealed why Masaru wears those weird golden rings on his shoulders and what not. The other characters all have qualities that stand out in their own way, though archetypical and stereotypical, but yet balanced and excellently parodied, and can still come across as original.\\nWell, the style may be a major turn off, but I doubt the purpose of this anime is to invent state of the art animation. Considering that it&rsquo;s comedy, the unorthodox designs truly reflect this, and helps form some understanding of what to expect. At times, you&rsquo;ll see the art change style such as making them like cylinder figures just to symbolize the stupidity and dumfound atmosphere of the moment and to make you laugh. During action sequences, they will parody the style of 1970s anime with the sketchy outlines and the more colorful hyperspace backgrounds for more dramatic purposes and explosiveness. I&rsquo;m not trying to give any kind of Emmy worthy merit for the style of this anime, I know it&rsquo;s not the greatest, but you have to watch it for the purpose of the intention this anime has like I said. I think the art style perfectly compliments the nature of the anime. I can&rsquo;t give it credit for style, but I will give it credit for execution.\\nUeda Yuuji is dead perfect as the voice of Masaru, and he is also the voice of Jin in Marvel vs Capcom 1 and 2. Put that portrayal into a comedy role, and you perfectly get Masaru. He does great with his passion, humor, just about everything that pulls you into the character and this show. The voice acting and execution also plays a big part of the humor. A certain portion of it will be hard to understand because it relies on puns within the Japanese language, which the fansubs will explain to you. Regardless of that, I still think its humor everyone can enjoy. At times Masaru will pull off counter intuitive motivational sayings that Dan Quayle and George W. Bush are only capable of that will make you laugh to tears. The voice acting overall is just incredible in making this anime work.\\nThe music is also pretty excellent in its use as well. The opening theme reflects the passionate comedy nature this anime has, so it really gives you an idea of what to expect and the imagery of the opening just adds more and more comedy to it. Ueda Yuuji also makes use of his unique singing talents as well with the official Sexy Commando Club song. The background music also makes use of all kinds of music whether overly dramatic or comedy just to further contribute the intentions of this anime.\\nThis is my favorite comedy of all time. A lot of people think it&rsquo;s ridiculous, which I don&rsquo;t blame them for. Sadly, I personally find there is some legitimate logic behind the sexy commando&rsquo;s purpose, which contributed why I was able to enjoy it. Hell, I&rsquo;m willing to use it in a real fight. But not every single bit of comedic moment will have purpose in relation to the story 75% of the time at my estimate, but if it&rsquo;s to make you laugh, then hey, they did something right. The way it ends, it makes you want more. Sadly, I know of no scanlations of the manga that are out, but if you know where to get the manga online, then link me up. But I say if you really love comedy from every single angle, then I strongly say check this out at your usual torrent site.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd221b8930b65007cbc14fcd873168ef6'}>,\n",

Also, no criticism’s allowed! — The review\\xaders father\\nThis review has had my heart and soul put into it. Please close all other win\\xaddows and focus on only the text.\\nIt is advised you read this review while listen\\xading to music, eat\\xading a sand\\xadwich while tweet\\xading that you are doing these three things.\\nQuick crash course: Sexy Com\\xadmando Gaiden is a 1998 anime, 50 epis\\xadodes long (although the epis\\xadodes them\\xadselves are only 10 minutes long so it’s not as long as first glance would have you believe) and\\nisn’t that well known in the west\\xadern world. It’s never been licensed in any way shape or form out\\xadside of Japan. It does, how\\xadever, have a massive cult fan\\xadbase inside Japan itself. Now the reason it’s not pop\\xadu\\xadlar abroad is pretty obvi\\xadous. It’s very Japan\\xadese in it’s humour. This is as Japan\\xadese as you can ima\\xadgine. Full of weird, non-explainable events with the clas\\xadsic man\\xadzai com\\xadedy style of the straight man to the funny man. But it’s only when you watch the show does the idea of why this is a cult hit make sense.\\nThe anime’s cent\\xadral focus is a gen\\xaderic main char\\xadac\\xadter and his encounter with the prac\\xadti\\xadtioner of the Sexy Com\\xadmando fight\\xading style, Masaru. Every aspect of Masaru’s char\\xadac\\xadter is a gradual build up of ran\\xaddom char\\xadac\\xadter traits. He wears rings on his shoulders that cause cash machines to start sprout\\xading ran\\xaddom phrases. If he takes them off, his hair grows shorter. Oh, and they also start spout\\xading smoke at occa\\xadsional inter\\xadvals. Not that any of this par\\xadtic\\xadu\\xadlarly annoys Masaru. He has a fond\\xadness for mous\\xadtaches and magical dis\\xadap\\xadpear\\xading base\\xadball throw\\xading tech\\xadniques. Oh, he also has a story about how he found those rings. One day, he was walk\\xading through the woods. He saw the rings on the ground, so he picked them up. The End.\\nYou start\\xading to get a pic\\xadture of what this anime is like yet? While Masaru is the ulti\\xadmate example of the sheer ran\\xaddom\\xadness of this anime, this trait fea\\xadtures through\\xadout the show. Char\\xadac\\xadters are intro\\xadduced with the most ran\\xaddom of char\\xadac\\xadter traits with the most bizarre abil\\xadit\\xadies with seem\\xadingly no real reason. If there was meant to be satire of some sort in this show, I never saw it. Maybe once or twice, but it would hap\\xadpen so infre\\xadquently that I came to dis\\xadmiss it. While it’s obvi\\xadous that I could miss a fair amount of the Japan\\xadese satire, I find it impossible to believe that I missed so much of it that I thought this wasn’t satire at all.\\nMy mind sees an totally batty author, about as mad as Masaru him\\xadself, who will think up of totally ran\\xaddom plot points and toss them in for the heck of it. He has a vague idea of what sort of story he’s try\\xading to tell. It’s about gen\\xaderic main char\\xadac\\xadter learn\\xading that there are rather less con\\xadven\\xadtional ways of mak\\xading friends (oddly close to Arakawa when I put it like that, but these two are nowhere near the same level), but for the most part he just makes shit up. But, and here’s the import\\xadant part, he runs with it. Any\\xadthing he’s writ\\xadten stays in. The ran\\xaddom\\xadness builds up and becomes part of the story. The anemic guy has the spirit of muscly, Japan\\xadese salary\\xadman from the muscle build\\xading ads inside him? Great, we’ll run with that through\\xadout the story and he’ll appear whenever it makes sense for him to do so (for a given value of ‘sense’ that is).\\nThis all builds up. The ran\\xaddom\\xadness becomes part of the story and part of the world. You’re always aware at how stu\\xadpid all this stuff is, and yet you grow accus\\xadtomed to see\\xading it. You’re sucked into the world of the Sexy Com\\xadmando, where the head\\xadmas\\xadter calls for breaks in class by dron\\xading ‘sea\\xadweed’ over and over again on the inter\\xadcom. Where girls have their fath\\xaders killed by rogue mous\\xadtaches. It all becomes part of the world you’ve got\\xadten sucked into, and it looks like so much fun you find your\\xadself want\\xading to join in. Hence, I can totally see why this is a cult hit. A world where people cry WANCHU and CLEANUP PRINCESS, know\\xading what they mean. A world where you can all dress in the cus\\xadtom\\xadary Sexy Com\\xadmando battle gear of the white, long sleeved shirt and jeans, with your team leader sport\\xading those fetch\\xading golden rings. Where you all come together to per\\xadform the Mel\\xadan\\xadcholy of Elise (the dra\\xadmatic unzip\\xadping of your fly, that is the pre\\xadcursor to every move in the Sexy Com\\xadmando hand\\xadbook). That’s a cult I’d love to be part of.\\nOh and by the way, the female coach is called Moe Moe. You now have another reason to watch this anime.\\nOh yeah, that open\\xading para\\xadgraph?

If one were looking for a laugh or merely something light-hearted and short, this show will tick all the right boxes. Whilst each episode only lasts 10 minutes, the amount of laughs garnered during that short time simply cannot be measured!\\n====== STORY=====\\nWithout a doubt, the anime’s lack of a coherent storyline is what contributes to its comedic shine. Sexy Commando Gaiden’s humour is heavily reliant on random slapstick and eccentric twists and hence, this style of comedy relays effectively off its weak (or lack of) storyline. In fact, it would come as no surprise\\nif one were to say that the humour defines the story (or vice versa).\\n======ART=====\\nFor an anime that aired in 1998, the art is just what one would expect. So whilst the art and animation may be somewhat ‘choppy’, this does not detract from the anime’s overarching purpose – to make you laugh.\\n====== SOUND=====\\nThe voice acting manages to reflect each of the character’s personality sufficiently. The OP is upbeat and, similar to the voice acting, successfully reflects the true nature of the anime.\\n====== CHARACTER=====\\nWhat really defines this particular anime is its cast of characters. If it were possible to personify comedy, the protagonist, Masaru, would perhaps be the closest result you can achieve. However, the said man is not the only conjurer of comedy in the anime. There exists a whole cast of characters that draw out the true essence of this anime; each one funnier than the last. The cast of characters range from the (somewhat) straight-man to the most peculiar student you will ever see.\\n====== ENJOYMENT=====\\nAs a dedicated fan of comedy, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Sexy Commando Gaiden. Its random and rapid-fire style of humour really plays to my taste – whether they are laughs generated through the witty puns or the constant ridiculousness of the situations the characters find themselves in.\\n====== OVERALL=====\\nTaking into the account the fact that the anime aired in 1998, I found it difficult to unearth a flaw in the show. However, it is important to understand that the anime’s style of humour may not necessarily cater to everybody’s tastes in comedy. To those looking for something more ‘intellectual’ (for lack of a better term), Sexy Commando Gaiden may not be for you. However, those merely seeking a show for a couple of light-hearted laughs are guaranteed to enjoy this anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '211875537d25aca51204db1dc32f428c'}>,\n",

It has a lot of foibles, but nothing that should keep you from skipping the series if you like action and adventure focused anime.\\nThis series is kind of like what you would get if you took Space Captain Harlock, but if instead of going the route of incredibly self-serious and subdued it went for of goofy and flamboyant. You can see the difference really starkly comparing the flashbacks, where Cobra has\\nlong hair, talks much more seriously, and the music becomes more dramatic, with the less serious present where Cobra looks goofy.\\nI first became excited by this series when Cobra was thinking really hard about his past, and then suddenly the art zoomed into a box like 1/12th the size of the screen with his face, resembling a mirror I guess, and then this randomly propagated five times in a diagonal line. I became even more excited when the first climactic battle scene had soft jazz playing, which was surreal and hilarious. It is the little details like this that make the series great if you watch out for them, and it is refreshing to have a series where the humor relies on wit instead of events like random school chase scenes (Code Geass) or how much food someone eats (too many anime to even try to single one out).\\nAs you can see from the summary, the series has three really nice arcs, with some shorter one shots and the like at times too, which gives you three different thoughtful stories. Fans of anime that really ramp up just how incredibly evil and malicious the enemy empire is might be disappointed here, since the main foe (The Guild) is, for the most part, more of an entity that Cobra is constantly annoyed by rather than a big bad that is so evil it must be taken down at any cost.\\nRegarding character, Cobra is unfortunately a little too much of your typically invincible hero. You never feel any urgency of a possible loss for Cobra, and indeed none ever comes. I do like how this series approaches the morals of the characters. The girls are sexual instead of sexually indignant all but once, taking compliments in stride even if they turn Cobra down. Although Cobra tries to generally save people, he certainly has no qualms about killing them. I think this is the first time I have seen or read anything like this that the hero does not constantly puzzle the moral quandary of whether or not a bad guy should die.\\nOne rather large character problem is that Cobra's sidekick, Lady, basically has no reason to be there. Lady either sits around waiting to rescue him when he finishes kicking ass, or she gets captured, giving Cobra motivation to kick someone's ass. This is probably not a series to watch if you become upset by subtle/overt chauvinism (whichever you would decide this series has).\\nThe voice acting is around the high quality level of any well funded '80s series. The music is never bad, but the main climactic theme is overused. The music is probably most exciting in any club scene, where the anime rather charmingly struggles to futurize '80s club life.\\nThe art is not the best art ever, but it is rather consistent. Rather amusing is that before commercial breaks and at the end of episodes the art becomes bolder and sketchier to try to strike an emphatic capturing of the boldness that the audience should be feeling...when often it is not really there.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4213a2a28c9f829c858b6dd9456788c5'}>,\n",

The first few episodes being 1-12 is the longest arc as it serves as the introduction to Cobra; displaying what can be expected in the series as a whole. Much of the highlight of Cobra is the creativity being put into the universe & science fiction as it features a wide range of aliens, robots, technology & even sports such as the Rug Ball episodes 16-19. Space Cobra excels in giving action & new content in every episode making it highly rewatchable.\\nAnother good aspect is the animation as the director Osamu Dezaki (Black Jack OVAs, Golgo 13 The Professional, Rose of Versailles) once again delivers his signature directing style with interesting angles & dramatic still shots. I believe this anime granted Dezaki more creative freedom due to the sci-fi content of Cobra as it allowed for various color schemes. In short, The Movie for Cobra & this series have the best stylized animation being a very colorful & eye pleasing anime of the early 80\\'s. Too some this may not seem like a big deal but for the animation it had in 1982, this is an accomplishment as it wasn\\'t until the late 80\\'s & early 90\\'s when anime series began to have a consistent look & multi-color approach to their shows. (Examples include Toei\\'s work in Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon, Fist Of The North Star 2, etc.)\\nAs expected in most episodic animes, if you don\\'t like the main character  you won\\'t enjoy the series. Cobra as a character is inspired by the French actor Jean-Paul Benmondo, however Cobra also comes off as a mix of James Bond & Han Solo. Usually being depicted as a woman loving badass, Cobra can behave goofy at times but feels natural much like Lupin & Ryo Saeba. While we don\\'t see an in depth look into his character we do understand what kind of person he is as more episode are watched. By the end of the series we see Cobra as a bit of an anti-hero as he tends to steal & kills various enemies of both genders but upholds chivalry towards certain people who ask for his help. He is often seen as selfish & uncaring, but deep down he has a good heart as seen in episode 26.\\nCobra is a manly anime that appeals to those who like to see a space adventure where a manly pirate goes up against robots, aliens,&  pirates which also delivers plenty of eye candy with its multicolored universe filled with sexy women. If you enjoyed this series then you should have no problem with watching the additional anime series being \"The Psycho Gun, Time Drive & Cobra The Animation 2010\". Thankfully, the recommendations list for this series is mostly accurate as the other animes that you may enjoy include the following. (Lupin the 3rd, Dirty Pair, Golgo 13, City Hunter, Goku Midnight Eye etc.) As a final note, Space Adventure Cobra has great opening & closing themes which you will occasionally listen to.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '46d400e8e6b3142c471e6f31c2ca2456'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Space Cobra is a classic action adventure from the 80s, directed by Osamu Dezaki.\\n*Story & Characters*\\nSpace Cobra\\'s story takes place (where else?) in the space! It\\'s basically just random 80\\'s sci-fi that is kinda silly by today\\'s standards. It contains wacky sci fi concepts, loads of improbable physics and even some magic… What\\'s great about it, is that the sci-fi itself doesn\\'t really matter in Cobra\\'s case, since it\\'s all about the action and the adventure while the sci-fi and space setting are just the dressing to make the adventure more epic and cool.\\nThe story itself is separated in to several arcs and a few\\nstand alone episodes, many of which are quite stand alone. It does have a main story that\\'s relevant in the first and final arcs.\\nMost of the arcs/episodes consist of Cobra taking up missions, fighting pirates or other alien creatures. They also end up involving (in one way or another) sexy chicks that wear skimpy outfits that Cobra ends up either having \"fun\" with, saving or fighting against.\\nIt is fast paced, has tons of action and it does give off a sense of adventure and discovering new and exotic locations. It\\'s all pretty simple, but it also ends on a very good note.\\nThe characters consist of Cobra and his female android called Lady (yep, that\\'s her name). Cobra is supposed to be a real role model for all men out there (I guess). He\\'s overpowered, doesn\\'t take crap from nobody and he\\'s a womanizer through and through. He also doesn\\'t think twice about sending his enemies to their deaths, which is nice. But the downside is that he hardly flinches when innocent people get killed as well.\\nLady is an android who\\'s supposed to be the strong waifu figure that takes care of Cobra and attempts to keep him in check. There doesn\\'t seem to be too much opportunity for chemistry between them, since she\\'s not around that often and they behave they\\'re very used to being around each other.\\nAside from them, the characters are either one or at best two dimensional villains, sexy women with little variety in personality, or ex-villains who usually end up dead rather quickly.\\nThat\\'s about it for this section. It delivers on what it promises, but don\\'t expect too much out of it.\\n*Art & Sound*\\nThe art style is very nice and surprisingly detailed. It also looks a little like a western cartoon and not so much like an anime which means that it is very nice and stylish. It\\'s actually pretty similar the 80s movie \\'Heavy Metal\\'.\\nThe animation is great and there\\'s a ton of action, most of which has nice choreography, decent looking explosions and brutal violence in which people get killed at the drop of a hat (not much blood though).\\nAs for the character designs, the female figures here look way ahead of their time in terms of how curvy and sexy they are, and a lot of the alien and spaceship designs look pretty creative as well. Cobra himself is a muscular dude who\\'s color coded red, has a goofy face and a gun for an arm. Now that is an awesome design. In addition, since this is a Space adventure there\\'s also a lot of variety in terms of locations which all look very nice.\\nVisually, Space Cobra has to be among the best tv anime ever, it holds up beautifully.\\nIn terms of soundtrack, there are some memorable tunes and the opening song specifically is very catchy.. It has cool Sound effects and cheesy, but solid voice acting. The only problem with it (which is problem with many 80s anime) is that the sound quality doesn\\'t sound very good by today\\'s standards, even in the blu ray version. I guess you get used to it after a while, but unfortunately iwere recording with toasters back then.\\n*Conclusion*\\nOverall Space Cobra is fairly creative and has superb production values. Doesn\\'t have that much substance to it, but it\\'s perfectly comfortable with what it is. It is also one of the most enjoyable shows I\\'ve seen in a very long time.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ba4cbaa26231cd03e2e7c3e99ae31100'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Cobra mostly follows our titular hero and his cyborg partner Lady Armaroid in their adventures traveling space as they cross paths with an intergalactic criminal organization called the Pirate Guild, which he was a former member of. In a way, the series has parallels to Lupin III as Cobra is an anti-hero due to his criminal background, a shameless flirt with the \"woman of the day\" that accompanies him on his adventures, is deceptively smart despite his smug attitude and is not afraid to kill off members of the Pirate Guild that he crosses paths with. The series also mixes around comedy, adventure and the\\noccasional dark developments to compliment the title\\'s premise.\\nHowever, Cobra does have quite a bit to it that allows it to distinguish itself from the famous anime thief. Unlike Lupin, Cobra isn\\'t completely episodic with its story as there are several arcs scattered throughout the series in which Cobra comes at odds with criminal activity linked to the Pirate Guild. The most notable ones that stick out from this consist of a fairly long arc where Cobra tries discovering the whereabouts of an ultimate weapon connected to triplet sisters, the famous Rug Ball competition and Cobra crossing paths with influential Guild leader Salamander. The series also offers up some rather creative implementations of its sci-fi premise such as Cobra\\'s spaceship able to shift its form, his Psycho Gun, a diverse number of alien and robotic threats confronted by Cobra and the mentioned Rug Ball game. The series is also not as slapstick as Lupin as it has a somewhat more realistic bent to it despite its sci-fi setting.\\nStill, the show isn\\'t without its imperfections. Like Lupin, Cobra does dabble into a few episodes that feel rather out of place with its setting and premise such as an episode where our lead crosses paths with a trouble-making genie. In addition, the series is a bit on the chauvinist side as mostly every relevant woman in this series is dressed in some kind of revealing attire, often get lusted for by Cobra and other men in the series and we usually get nude shots of them. Episodes also suffer from a fairly repetitive plot structure at points with Cobra gawking with attractive women and not being seriously challenged by most enemy Pirate Guild threats, with only Crystal Boy and Salamander being serious threats to our lead.\\nVisually, Cobra is rather dated as its animation style is a product of its time with the way character and scenery designs are drawn. However, the makers of the series do surprisingly well with concealing its rather limited animation as it was rather hard for me to notice shortcuts. Also, I did not notice many instances of degradation of character detail during distant camera shots or scenes of heavy movement that took place onscreen\\nOverall, I\\'d think of Cobra as a somewhat more serious spin of Lupin III having its own unique pros and cons. It is not as episodic as Lupin and features some nice elements of world building from its sci-fi lacking from the gentleman thief\\'s title. However, Cobra is a bit more chauvinist in its treatment of women and suffers from some of the similar issues Lupin has with its episodic storytelling format. Regardless, Cobra still offers enough to give it its own unique feel and is mostly trying to have fun with the adventures and antics of its titular lead. If you\\'re a fan of 80s anime, Space Adventure Cobra is a memorable title of the era that is worth checking out at least once.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '93bf8452da66301b7d87229e22b425b5'}>,\n",

Its an episodic adventure series with a handful of story arcs comprised of linking episodes together throughout, following the adventures of a space pirate named Cobra who operates outside the law to do battle with the villainous Pirates Guild, a syndicate of criminals seeking to control the galaxy.\\nThe series is light on depth, character and world building but HUGE on style and adventure. Everything is fairly formulaic, especially if you're familiar with the aforementioned James Bond films, and this series follows these cliches without\\nmuch variation. Expect lots of cool but shallow villains, attractive women in danger, and Cobra always coming out on top somehow via cleverness or just being outright unstoppable. There's a tongue in cheek quality to the series, however, and the show certainly knows how to have fun with itself. While Cobra might be an unstoppable superman, he's goofy as hell and not suave or smooth at all, often bungling about his adventures with a laugh. This is what gives Cobra its lasting appeal and staying power, to me. It takes the daring adventure setups of its influences and treats them almost like comedy, giving the whole run a lighthearted touch that makes it fun to watch.\\nCharacters are shallow and often one-shot, only Cobra and Lady Armaroid, his co-pilot companion, appear in any real major capacity in the series aside from a few story arc characters that often end up dead by the end of their arc, and only Cobra ever really sees much action, which is a shame because Lady is badass in her own right. As said earlier, style is all over this series, from the aesthetics to the jazzy soundtrack (especially that opening theme!) and how the series pioneered certain art techniques for dramatic effects, namely the freeze frame matte paintings that hold on an explosion or dramatic pose. Yep, Cobra pioneered that.\\nAll in all while I can't say Cobra is ESSENTIAL viewing for old school space opera classics, if you're into dumb fun adventure and don't really care if something has a strong narrative to hold it together then definitely check Cobra out. If the tropes that inspired Cobra would annoy you and you're looking for something original or in depth, best might want to keep away.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3576da5d00fb1e172425fe308329a350'}>,\n",

There are two stories in the entire 31 episode run that span multiple episodes. But other than that it's a new adventure every episode. However, this does not mean that only the story arcs are worth it. The episodic episodes are also a lot of fun. Sure, they don't add much to the story of the show, but lets be honest here, you're not watching Space Cobra for the intriguing world or the fantastic characters. You're watching Space Cobra to watch an awesome manly man being awesome, doing cool stuff, blowing stuff up, killing people, getting women, and so on and so forth.\\nThe animation in this show is ok.

What I can say though, is that I wish they would have fleshed out the universe a bit more than what they did, but I don't concider that a huge issue.

It should say it's sci-fi in the genres list of whatever site you're on but this is actually an extremely lucid fantasy in the guise of a high tech space journey, having the tendency to violate laws of reality in jaw-droppingly dumb ways. There is a race of people that are actually swords, sand that has the right consistency to be both walked on and swam through at the same time, pianos with the power to decode hidden messages in tattoos, a fat magician that can project himself across the cosmos\\nwho enslaves people with a fruit that makes them explode, and the protagonist has the ability to talk and smoke cigarettes while he's underwater. Absolutely none of this is explained. You have to enter it with the assumption that technology can do literally fucking anything in the Cobra universe. It will numb your brain if you're not ready. This is, in a sense, the best thing about the show. There were too many moments where I got confused and just awkwardly laughed it off.\\nWith that out of the way, it's kind of hard to review. Is it good? Yeah, I guess. It's mostly quite formulaic in the one-off stories strewn across the show and you could still enjoy it if you just skipped over those episodes entirely (but don't, you have to see this in all of its mind boggling glory). The main story arcs are pretty fun, though, especially the Rugball arc, which I would say is the high point of the show.\\nIn terms of the visuals, animation is pretty fluid for the 80s. Colors are vomited all over the place. Looks super vibrant and aesthetically pleasing (usually).\\nThe characters are, well, they're there. There is basically no character development to speak of. They do cool stuff sometimes, but you never get to know them. There will be a random acquaintance of Cobra off in some nowhere corner of the galaxy that he'll rely on for help every few episodes, and they're just there, and they'll either disappear or die at some point. The first time you see a character just know there is a 1/10 chance that they are one of Cobra's old friends.\\nThe music is also just kind of there. Is it bad? No. Is it good? Some of it. Mostly the opening. And speaking of the opening, it's just as lucid as the show. In most openings I find that there are symbols, foreshadowing and such all relevant to things that happen or appear in the show but Cobra's opening just mashes together a bunch of shit that doesn't make sense because it looks cool. There's bubbles that fly across the screen and if you pause on them they've got weird decrepit alien fetus things in them, there's a weird piece of grid paper that flies around, an unnecessary emphasis on a transparent copy of Cobra's left eye, and he also dodges some neon circles and triangles just before it ends.

All I understood was that there was a red haired awkward boy who was constantly followed around by an annoying white-haired self-proclaimed alien with a talking fish. However, as time passed on and more episodes were watched, everything became clear and the plot revealed itself. However, Tsuritama is so much more than that.

When I first watched Tsuritama, the colorful bright array of colors was one of the only reasons I kept on watching.

We are imbued with a real sense of fulfilment, as through their fishing we are\\nnot only a witness to their own personal growth, but also to the most important theme of the show—friendship.\\nThere can be no doubt that by the end of the last episode, you will find yourself truly invested in the characters. You will feel like you have walked through the streets of Enoshima yourself, and you will feel like you could just as easily cast off, and spend the afternoon winding down to a spot of fishing—it can be that immersive at times.\\nA big part of why is due to the art and the sound, which are both thoroughly quirky. The art in particular, opts for a unique style that colours the setting of Enoshima and its occupants, in a vivid, refreshing palette. It does a fantastic job of symbolising and emphasising certain parts, which at times can also make it feel rather reminiscent of a work by Shaft.\\nThe use of sound is also well thought out. The OP and ED are incredibly catchy, and ease you into the feel of the show, whilst the soundtrack never feels repetitive, or out of place.\\nIt should go without saying that there are obvious limitations.

The result is ultimately spontaneous, for better or for worse.\\nYuki has a hard time making friends. Always moving from place to place, there's little time for him to get to know anyone, and his social anxiety doesn't help. More than anything, he's afraid of being considered weird. But while living with his grandmother on the island of Enoshima, Yuki meets a self-proclaimed\\n'alien' transfer student named Haru. To make matters worse, his grandmother is allowing Haru to stay with them, and he's asked their classmate to teach them to fish.

Until the direction of the series shifts drastically.\\nDisorienting would be an understatement. The events that follow this change feel like two completely different shows quickly mashed together. Plot elements that were previously completely ignored or played off as jokes were then brought to the forefront, and the elements I was beginning to grow fond of became totally irrelevant. As Tsuritama makes its way down a long checklist of sci-fi and coming-of-age clichés, we learn more about the history and goals of our characters as they work their way towards an unexciting climax. Given that the characters are nearly impossible to care about, the drama goes nowhere; the only effort put into writing them is regarding how weird or unique they are. It's enough for a simple slice of life, but becomes intolerable once any relatively serious element comes into play.\\nThe only real consistency viewers should note is within the art and sound. If anything, the latter is too consistent. While the music is fun and compositionally playful, there's little risk or direction taken with it. The soundtrack is seemingly only made up of woodwind instruments and the occasional percussion, and that's the problem. While it may compliment the occasional scene, it usually sticks out like a sore thumb. The cheerfulness of it all doesn't refrain from playing in the middle of more dramatic or tense moments, so why not make use of silence? Character designs are also notable, but not in a positive fashion. The visuals are incredibly close to being considered good; you're shown scene after scene of bold, watercolour-inspired scenery and characters, yet something as simple as their hair doesn't match up with the rest of the artstyle. Thankfully, it's probably the only thing in the show that looks outright ugly, but it was more than enough to bother me a few times every episode.\\nWith the first half of Tsuritama serving only as a setup for the second, it feels like a playful accident in which character development was an afterthought. As a whole, it could probably be described as an all-too-sweet desert stuffed into you after you're already full. The extra course proved to be a bit too much for me, but the less picky may find it welcome or even superior to the main dish.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'It\\'s a bit early yet to say anything definitive about Tsuritama. And yet I think that it\\'s not too early to describe the series as rather unique. Having said that, I\\'ll edit this review as the season progresses.\\nTsuritama was created by the same director who did Mononoke and Trapeze - two series memorable for distinctive visual style and approach to storytelling. I think in some ways Tsuritama is a younger sibling to those series - while it is certainly as interesting to look at and only  mildly less thought-provoking, it has a sense of humor about it that is somehow invigorating - there\\'s fun\\nto be had here, in a fishing village called Enoshima. The setting is certainly colorful, and it\\'s got nothing on the characters.\\nOur lead, Yuki Sanada, is an anxious young man who has the unfortunate tendency to make a hideous facial expression whenever something makes him uncomfortable. His foil is a self-proclaimed alien invader named Haru who thus far seems to be capable of controlling people with a single squirt of his water gun. If it sounds like Haru is in any way sinister, you\\'ve been misled - so far, the only thing he enjoys using this power for is forcing unwilling high schoolers to dance a folk-dance. Haru is irrepressibly upbeat and smiley, and his character is more charming than anything else. Soon we meet a few other boys with social issues - there\\'s Natsuki Usami, the \"fishing Prince,\" who seems rather friendless and resentful of his father. And perhaps best of all is an Indian boy with a duck accomplice - yes, a duck - who seems to be investigating Haru. The duck\\'s name is Tapioca; the boy\\'s name is Akira.\\nSo far, these kids aren\\'t exactly all that friendly with each other. But we should give them time.\\nThis show pretends to be about fishing, but it\\'s not. It pretends to be about an alien invasion, but that\\'s not quite it either. It sometimes seems to be about social anxiety, and that\\'s closer to the mark. As of now, Tsuritama is sprouting into a show about friendship among misfits. Our protagonists are as goofy a bunch of oddballs as any that anime proffers, but it is already apparent that the best friendships may be grown from mutual weirdness.\\nIf all of this seems rather vague and plotless when laid before you, I think in some senses that\\'s the point. This show is deliberately casual and nearly introspective in the way it develops its characters. There\\'s something beautiful i how not a great deal of fuss is made about the fact that one of the lead protagonists is probably from a foreign planet. The show manages to be leisurely and captivating, and most importantly - it doesn\\'t seem to take itself too seriously. This is disarming, of course - because I think the show itself should be looked at with a serious eye.\\nThis should appeal to fans of Kuragehime and Welcome to the NHK. Artistically and tonally, it has been noted that this is similar to Mawaru Penguindrum. I hope that Tsuritama earns a following like Penguindrum did, because it\\'s just quirky enough to merit it.\\nTL;DR: Tapioca is a duck; Akira feeds him duck curry.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsuritama (2012) is an “odd duck” (pun intended) of an anime, meaning it uses a less common style of story telling. While many stories can happen almost “anywhere,” and many occur in a fantasy location, this show has a very strong sense of a real place; namely Enoshima.\\nEnoshima is an actual Island at the mouth of the Katase River in Sagami Bay, on the Pacific Ocean. The island is connected to the mainland by a pair of 600m bridges; a pedestrian bridge and a bridge for motor vehicles. Enoshima and Sagami Bay were made world famous for being the harbour and the area where the\\nsailing races of the 1964 Olympic Games were held.  The island is the centre of Shōnan, a popular resort area both because of the sandy beaches, and because of its proximity to Tokyo. Enoshima is roughly halfway between the center of Tokyo and the top of Mount Fuji.\\nThe anime renders accurate depictions of the area, albeit with vibrantly exaggerated colours. The bridges, the sky tree (a prominent feature of Enoshima), the train stations, the high school, the beaches and piers, even the bridge at the mouth of the Katase River, and many other features of the area are all reproduced quite well for us here to enjoy.\\nThis is a complex story with many layers and story types. It is partly a fishing story, partly a coming of age story, a story about the value of friendship and family, the importance of place, a even little bit of Man vs Alien, all with enough whimsy and over-the-top absurdity to keep it fun. With the exception of the opening of Episode 1, the entire story occurs in the Enoshima area, either on land or in the waters of Sagami Bay. And it is this strong sense of a real place that keeps the story somewhat grounded, even when the most absurd of events are occurring.\\nAlmost all of the characters are, obviously, caricatures. The story is primarily about Yuki Sanada, a boy so helplessly self-conscious that he makes an absurd face when under stress which only makes him feel even more self-conscious and stressed. He lives with his Grandmother, Keito Sanada. Yuki is not particularly bright nor gifted in any way, but he is a nice guy when he’s not allowing himself to be too embarrassed to show it. Keito tries her best to guide and advise Yuki.\\nUpon arriving in Enoshima, an alien named Haru moves in with Yuki and Keito. Haru’s has arrived on Earth with his sister, Coco, and they have a mission to fulfil while here. Coco only shows up from time to time in the series. Haru immediately starts work on their mission, and Yuki is going to play a prominent role in fulfilling their mission on earth. Not being from earth, Haru is often unaware of human emotions and also find himself receiving plenty of advice from Keito.\\nEverybody needs a hobby, a pastime, or some goals in life. And everyone needs a mentor to be able to succeed at any of those. Natsuki Usami, a fellow high school student of Yuki and Haru, is a bit of a loner. Natsuki starts as the fishing instructor and mentor for Yuki and Haru and becomes a friend to them over time. He is a locally famous for his fishing skills and is called the “fishing prince” for his skills in competitions. Natsuki lives with his father and sister. His relations with his father are strained, but he holds his sister quite dear and is like another, much kinder, person around her.\\nThe last of the main characters is the alien hunter, Akira Agarkar Yamada. He is older than Yuki, Haru and Natsuki, by about 10 years, but he ends up in the same high school anyway. Akira is quite aloof and another loner character. Akira keeps a white goose (or is it an oversized duck), named Tapioca, with him at all times, and constantly talks to it. Akira is an agent of “Duck,” a mysterious organization that tracks aliens. Akira has enough rank to have several agents who report to him, but still reports to several layers of superiors within “Duck.” Unsurprisingly, “Duck” has resources at its command that would make most Generals, and even most Commanders-In-Chief, jealous. As Akira follows and starts interacting with Haru and the rest, he becomes aware of the mission that Haru and Coco have, and starts to take part with fulfilling their mission while also making fiends with Natsuki, Haru and Yuki.\\nThe story and action are the catalyst for the bringing together of these four characters. Haru, in part to fulfill his mission and in part because of how his character is, is usually the one to push and pull the story along until the climactic scenes. Learning any new skill takes time and practice and the process can be quite frustrating, even for fishing. But this learning process is the time when Haru, Yuki and Natsuki start to get to know each other, and during this process they become closer. It is also during this process that Akira stops watching from afar, and starts to participate with the others.\\nThe story shows us how Yuki turns from an awkward boy with little by way of roots in any place, to a more confident young man with a deep connection to Enoshima; for this reason alone the story’s strong sense of place in Enoshima is critical. Haru, who knows little of human relationships, comes to learn of the importance of family and friends, and learns to participate as a friend amongst humans, all while receiving motherly advice from Keito and while being supported by his sister, Coco. Natsuki is able to open up enough to make friends with the others, and also opens himself up enough to improve his relations with his father. Meanwhile Akira is able to also open up and find friends, and to find the fortitude to stand up to what is important to him.\\nFish tales are always hyperbole, and this anime is likewise over-the-top. But at its core is a heartwarming story about growing up and making friends, and about what friends can do together to overcome incredible hardships. It also shows that process of making friends is not without its own hardships, and that overcoming these hardships is well worth the effort. Likewise, the art style, the music, the story, the characters are all also over-the-top. But that it is all a bit over-the-top helps add to the comedy while softening some of the harsher moments.\\nBecause it is a bit over-the-top it can be a bit hard to see the core of the story, specifically the character development of the main characters, at least at the beginning. But if you let yourself be taken in by this fish tale, you’ll have a whale of a time.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '64b7c949f9e7374f6f728cdf142bb563'}>,\n",

The pacing of the story is like that of a swelling wave: first you don\\'t notice how slowly it\\'s building up, and then suddenly it\\'s 30 feet high and growing more impressive by the second.\\nAt first, I rated this anime an 8, but right now it\\'s a solid 10, and it wouldnt have been without the earlier episodes to build it up to the final and beautiful conclusion.\\nThe anime isn\\'t exactly slice of life, if I had to pick a genre, it would\\nprobably fit best in that category in terms of feel.\\n---\\nCharacters: 10\\n---\\nThe story starts off with two main protagonists: Yuki (Japanese: Winter Snow) the red head with a fear of being stared at, and Haru (Spring), the innocent alien whose complete lack of self-consciousness allows him to bond with everyone. The story then expands to include Natsuki (Nastu=Summer), the reclusive fishing Prince with family problems, and Akira (Aki=fall), the indian who grew up friendless and claims that friendship is unnecessary. Each of these characters has a problem that they try to deal with on their own, but is unable to overcome until they accept the help from their friends.\\nHaru is the most polarizing character of the bunch. Because he\\'s an alien, he inadvertently says or does some very, very offensive things. Like, \"wow please just get punched in the face now\" offensive. If you hate the series because of Haru, or because the plot is too slow, just stick with it, because I promise it gets better.\\n---\\nPlot: 10\\n---\\nYes, there is some plot. From the first episode, you see that an fishy alien (Haru) comes down to earth and meets the socially-anxious Yuki, and asks him to fish with him. Plot wise, the anime goes deeper into how Yuki masters each fishing technique (shounen-style) from his tutor Natsuki, while Akira, the DUCK officer, tries to observe Haru without drawing suspicious. While this might not sound exciting enough to make you keep watching, I promise you it is better than it sounds. And that the main draw of the anime isn\\'t exactly the plot as it is the character development and the forging of friendships\\nPerhaps the most beautiful part of this anime is seeing how each of these characters manages to change dramatically from the start of the series to the end, especially when you notice that a development in one character manages to spur maturity in another, and etc. Isn\\'t this how we mature as people in real life, as well?\\n- Pacing Note -\\nFirst 5 episodes - slow, but the effort the show puts into developing basically every character and story you\\'ll run into makes the emotional payoff from these episodes worth it. You have to pay attention, because there are so many beautiful little details scattered throughout that I didnt notice until I rewatched them (after episode 11)\\nAll episodes after the first 5: just ridiculously amazing. The plot resurfaces after seemingly been shoved aside for awhile, and everything just picks up.\\n- Overall, this a beautifully drawn anime with a relatively simple (though eccentric) plot of how these 4 really different people meet, become friends, and change each other for the better.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5e1eaa9de33e0eac8df39f7d28869809'}>,\n",

In his new town he meets Haru, who’s an alien and insists that they have to be friends and go fishing together.\\nThe story itself its simple developed and doesn’t show us too complex scenarios, but keeps a focus on human relationships and feelings: ‘How do we express ourselves? How do we handle trouble?’ are the main topics expressed on the series, which aren’t deeply developed, instead, it follows the plot with the common structure of beginning,\\ndevelop and final resolution. Its very simple but it didn’t came across as a poor story for a 12 episode anime.\\nArt: 8\\nBright pastel colors make this anime fresh and vibrant yet simple in consistency with the plot. The art plays an important part in show us how Yuki feels: Yuki’s anxiety and fear of meeting new people is presented in a symbolic way, in various scenes we can see him being drowned by water as a metaphor of his feelings at the moment, and, as someone who has anxiety, u can really relate to that sensation of suffocation.\\nSound: 9\\nThe soundtrack is in hands of ‘Kuricorder Quartet’ a group which main instrument is the recorder, a sound that transports us to childhood and simpler times. Because of this, the anime is loaded of nostalgia and a bit of humor, making the story homely and lively, at the extent of making you forget about the fact that Haru is an alien.\\nBasically, it’s a heartwarming soundtrack that also rescues the magic of the real life and its simplicity.  -please listen to ‘tsuritama march’, it’s a gift-\\nCharacter: 8\\nTeenagers with common worries and also different ways of connecting with other people are presented in the series. I gave it an 8 because there’s no much complexity in the characters and they develop friendship through fishing, just like a common sports anime, something that we have seen before, which is not bad at all. I think that’s the charm of the series, bringing a light story to us.\\nAlso, I want to mention Haru’s voice and way of talking, because his japanese isn’t perfect and sounds like someone who just learned the language, it’s a small detail, but I consider it important to the characterization of an alien.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI love light stories with a bit of fantasy.

       "  <Document: {'content': '*updated* Ah, fishing. It\\'s how a group of four boys will quite possibly save the world.\\nI\\'ll be first to say that the premise of four quasi-bishonen boys is what enticed me to start tsuritama. The statement that this show is about an amazing story of saving the world comes at a close second.\\nTsuritama spends part of the show developing characters and relationships and such, like an entertaining extended backstory. It has a very light mood, heavily reminiscent of a slice-of-life comedy, mixed with a little \"Growing-Up Protagonists\". However, without saying too much, the series then takes a relatively dark turn; and the original hook for\\nthe series, the saving-the-world part, is addressed. The development of the characters from the earlier portion of the show further adds to the drama, and it makes a good normal-boys-turned-hero tale. With all this said, it is still not an action or fighting anime. It was never meant to be, but that doesn\\'t mean it lacks suspense and emotion.\\nSpeaking of the characters, they are all very interesting, to begin with. In the main cast, first impressions are as follows: There\\'s the But-Not-Too-Foreign Yuki with his thizz face panic attacks, the adorable alien Haru, Akira, the turban-wearing spy guy, and Natsuki, the tsundere fishing prince. With glasses. That doesn\\'t even begin to cover all of tsuritama\\'s characters. All of the cast is quirky and well-developed and it\\'s truly fun to watch them interact with each other.\\nI suck at critiquing art, but the art is particularly pretty and fascinating in tsuritama; with vibrant color palettes and seemingly brand new blends of ocean blue. The use of animated cut-out style backgrounds is kind of cool. In no way does the art style look cheap-o whatsoever, and they do great justice to the sea. They don\\'t make water look overly realistic looking, but it is just as well-animated with the occasional cut-outs or lots of pretty blends of blue.\\nThe sound makes good use of whimsical instruments and such, like flutes and recorders, to suit the relatively light mood of the series that takes place by the ocean. When necessary, the sound is able to take the central themes and create multiple semi-orchestral versions to suit the situation, varying from triumph to touching. Darker themes exist too, and they are executed quite well for such an airy series. It is well-suited to the series and fitting, but then again, it is nothing TOO spectacular; and for that it loses some points. I\\'d also like to pay special attention to the opening sequence, \\'cause the song is really freaking catchy. The dancing OP is not as out of place as one would think it\\'d be, since it is a traditional Japanese dance (at least I think it is); and hey, Haru had the mind control gun. He could totally be controlling the cast to dance. The voice actors, as well, are very suited to their characters, especially Haru\\'s bubbly voice.\\nI definitely recommend tsuritama: It\\'s a story packed with great characters, humor, and captivating art.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4571a08b0ef1688ff690ce0387de4c8a'}>,\n",

While I did l enjoy the creative mix of fishing, supernatural, and alien, sometimes the absurdity of it all made the the story feel kind of silly.  There were where times when the mixing of genres would take away the bite out of serious moments, of course there were also those pitched perfect moments where everything just came together.  It was a bit awkward, but for the most part, it just worked.\\nI am a real sucker for interesting art styles, I really couldn't help but appreciate that in\\nTsuritama.  The vibrant colors really made this anime pop, and it really suited a lot of the characters.  Towards the end of the series a lot of that color was brought down to fit the climax, what little color was left really gave it a surreal sort of tone, fitting for an alien.\\nThe music was great through out the series, though I did wish they would have changed the eyecatch a little at times.  Hearing its happy tone interrupting some of the more serious moment was a bit unsettling, luckily the series remained happy go lucky most of the time, so this problem didn't occur too much.\\nIn all honestly, I had some trouble getting used to Haru at the beginning, but I eventually warmed up to is absurd personality.  As the story went on, Haru along with the rest of the cast became easier to sympathize with or just generally like.  Whether it is the father who is trying to fix the strained relationship with his son, or the hilarious antic of the love struck small time ship captain.

       "  <Document: {'content': '=================\\nINTRO\\n=================\\nWow. I\\'m surprised how this gem passed under my radar for so long. I\\'ve forgotten how long it was since I watched a show so fun and relaxing that I always have a stupid grin on my face after each episode.\\nTsuritama is simple (the studio knows it) and sometimes simplicity is good enough for a show about fishing.\\n=================\\nTHE REVIEW\\n=================\\nThe show starts with Yuki, a socially awkward boy, transferring to a new school. There he\\nmeets Haru, who\\'s a hyperactive self-proclaimed alien, and invites him to fishing. Sounds silly? Don\\'t worry it gets more sillier! Haha. From there on, you will see an indian guy, an alien organization that worships ducks, hilarious dances, squirt gun madness, a cool grandma, etc. You can actually see that the studio is having a great time making this show.\\nThe background visuals are well suited to the show. It\\'s simple but the colors are crisp and vibrant. There are times when the backgrounds looks like painting out of a canvass and it\\'s just a treat to watch. The meshing of the colors are really relaxing to the eyes and you would just want to sit back, get a cool drink, and relax.\\nThe pacing was also pretty good. Some might find it a little slow but for a premise such as fishing you don\\'t need an adrenaline pumping sequence. Truthfully, every scene has a purpose and builds character.\\n=================\\nCHARACTERS\\n=================\\nThis is where tsuritama shines.  Our main characters feel so alive. Yuki starts off as an anxious boy who\\'s had a difficult time making friends due to him and his Grandma moving places so frequently. Natsuki, the fishing prince, is a grumpy rebellious boy who has a family problem. Ya-maaaaa-dah, the indian guy, starts off as a stalker. Haru, the alien, is just there to annoy Yuki. Each episode always bring something to their characters and by the end of the show they have shown a new level maturity and growth.\\nThe supporting characters are also engaging specially the Grandma, Natsuki\\'s family, and Tapioca the duck. Yes...the duck. I can\\'t count how many times I\\'ve laughed whenever Tapioca gets a screentime. And come on, it\\'s name alone makes me crave for a bubble tea.\\nI also liked the symbolisms. From Yuki getting drowned whenever anxious, Haru carrying a fishbowl, Natsuki getting a haircut, the flowers in the garden, etc. It provides a nice contrast to the silliness of the show.\\nThe soundtrack is also good, I find myself always looking forward to the ED. When that \"Hooo..Ho Ho..Ho Ho.\" starts to fade in, I find myself humming to the tune and singing it. It\\'s a nice song to listen to when you\\'re at the beach.\\nFor a SoL show, there is actually an overarching plot that slowly gets develop with each episode so even with the \"compelling story guys\", they will have a hard time bashing the show.\\n=================\\nVERDICT\\n=================\\nTsuritama tells a good story and message. Like fishing, we may find ourselves bored and exhausted with our everyday lives; but when we finally caught that elusive fish, friendship in Yuki\\'s case, it makes all those difficult moments worth it. Thing is, we should always cherish the smallest things in our lives no matter the hardship because that\\'s what living comes down to.\\nThere a some flaws with the show and I\\'m pretty conflicted whether I should deduct it to my score. It could\\'ve been better to add more characters or show some character\\'s backstory but at the same time it felt like the overall intention of the show might get lost if it was the case. So ultimately, I give it:\\n9.5/10!\\nTsuritama is one of the best on its genre. It\\'s full of enjoyable characters and silly moments. Don\\'t watch this show with the intention of getting an adrenaline pumping story.

It was produced by Studio A1-Pictures and aired  during 2012\\'s spring season.\\nWhile directed by Nakamura Kenji and written by Oono Toshiya, it is most likely best recognized for its character designer, Uki Atsuya.\\nIn this kinda SoF, kinda sports and kinda sci-fi anime, the headline is “You can\\'t catch fish if you don\\'t go fishing, and you can\\'t\\nmake friends if you don\\'t at least try.”\\nThe story follows Sanada Yuki, who just had to move to the island of Enoshima with his grandmother. His problem is, he\\'s really bad at talking with strangers, can\\'t handle pressure and therefore has problems making friends.\\nThen there\\'s Haru, who just out of nowhere declares four things:\\n1. He\\'s an alien.\\n2. He\\'s now Yuki\\'s friend.\\n3. He\\'s now living with Yuki.   and\\n4. He wants to learn fishing with Yuki.\\n“Why fishing?”, you may ask. Well, there seems to be one of Haru\\'s kin living in the sea around the island and threatening all of humanity, and he chose Yuki to help catch him.\\nThe dynamic between those two boys make out a great chunk of the show, as Haru really easily befriends just about anyone with his open and funny nature, and Yuki as the contrast, an introvert who usually prefers not to talk. Due to Haru having no clue of common sense from Yuki\\'s perspective, they often clash with each other, but through that, Yuki can grow and become a better person making some friends on the way.\\nOne of these friends is Natsuki, an experienced fisher in their age, called the “prince of fishing”, who\\'s constantly in argument with his father after his mother died, but cares deeply about his little sister. And believe me, he and his problems get their time to shine.\\nThen there\\'s Akira, an indian agent for a secret organization called “DUCK” with the mission to find, observe and capture aliens. He\\'s also a big fan of fishing and therefore combines his hobby with Haru\\'s observation. He also has a duck called Tapioca.\\nIn the supporting cast, every character has their clear role and fulfills that without problems, Keito, the aforementioned grandmother, for example, who acts as a mentor for Haru or Koko, Haru\\'s sister who doubts Yuki\\'s ability to catch fish and puts even more pressure on him. And Tapioca is there as well. Just saying.\\nAll the characters, be it main cast or a supporting role, are extremely fun to watch and likeable.\\nLike many other shows from A1-Pictures, Tsuritama\\'s visuals seem gorgeous at first, especially in this case, as the unique artstyle full of blue and many light colors, really supports both the quirkyness and lightheartedness of the show. The animation though has some drops in the later parts from its usually pretty good standarts, but in this case, they aren\\'t so major they\\'d interrupt your enjoyment of the show.\\nTsuritamas soundtrack by a band called \"Kuricorder Quartet\" simply fits the show perfectly.\\nAnd while that may seem totally random, some parts reminded me of the music for the “lost woods” in “ocarina of time” and “kirby air ride”s OST, two of my all-time favorite videogames, so that is cool.\\nMost of the sound is really soothing and calm or supports the shows quirky atmosphere, but even when for example Natsuki\\'s story arc reaches its dramatic climax, the OST can adapt to that. That said though, there aren\\'t really that many pieces I\\'d listen to outside of the series, and in these more dramatic parts, the opening and ending can really easily feel out of place if you marathon the show.\\nMy personal favorite tracks would be #1 – “Tsuritama March” and #19 - “Hajimete Tsuru”.\\nI can\\'t really say anything about the japanese dub though, as I have no complaints whatsoever, but also can\\'t crown one of the voice actors for doing a job out of the ordinarily good you find in any well made show.\\nAs for the english dub, well, it\\'s passable. If you don\\'t tend to like dubs, this won\\'t convince you otherwise, but if you don\\'t feel like reading subtitles, you might as well consider it as long as you\\'re not too picky.\\nNow, the only question left: Is Tsuritama worth the watch?\\nYes, definetly, go for it. I wouldn\\'t define it as a must-watch, but if you have the opportunity to see it, you\\'ll most likely not be disappointed, as I think just about everyone can get something out of the show.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3bb6501320cce560ad7d5e623fc2b9c8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Let me get one thing straight: I hated 2012. I hated all the stuff that has been going on in my life since November 2011, when everything I know and love suddenly started mercilessly going down the drain. Ever since then, I've wanted to crawl under a rock and die, and I still do! Heck, I'd even be so bold as to wish that the world DID end on December 21st, 2012! After all the crap that's been happening to me, I honestly didn't think I'd ever be happy again, and I still don't think I'll ever be truly happy again considering how traumatizing everything's\\nbeen for me...that is, until April 2012. What if, one day, you were in a really depressed mood, and then you suddenly find something that somehow manages to put a smile on your face throughout the whole thing. It's so cheery, so colorful, so funny, so bright, so optimistic, so joyful, and so downright refreshing that you feel so happy you wonder why you were ever depressed in the first place. That is Tsuritama, right here. I still consider anime to be my gateway drug in times of great despair and anguish...though this anime in itself just fulfilled all of my gateway drug wishes.\\nA lot of people were a bit confused by the story so I'll try to explain it as clearly as possible. There's this kid named Yuki whose grandmother has to move around a lot due to her job, and he hasn't been able to make friends, nor does he have the proper social skills to really make any, and is frequently overcome with anxiety, mostly in the form of his face turning into a red demon face which scares the heck out of everybody (Why does it happen to him? I dunno. They never explain it). So he and his grandmother move to Enoshima, a beautiful island by the sea. All of a sudden, Yuki is approached by this strange cloud cuckoolander kid named Haru who claims he's an alien and forces him to go fishing. Why? Because Haru wants to save the world. But why does he need Yuki of all people, and how can fishing save the world? Joining them are Natsuki, a sour kid who hates everybody, and Akira, a strange Indian guy who works for an organization named DUCK and has a pet duck named Tapioca. They go on a bunch of adventures while learning about fishing, though some strange stuff happens.\\nIf there's one thing I noticed about anime in my seven years of watching them in Japanese, it's the fact that no two anime can really have the same animation style (save for some exceptions). Every anime is different in their presentation and animation, which I think is one of the reasons why I've stuck with a lot of anime for all these years, and Tsuritama is no different. However, Tsuritama's animation in itself is quite different from a lot of modern anime you see in this day and age. Everything is completely bright and colorful for the purpose of showing us the sheer joy we find in the things we like doing, like how Yuki grows to like fishing after trying it. The animation style also helps to set the mood when it needs to, bright when it's happy and cheery, dark when wants to be serious and morose, and believe me, Tsuritama DEFINITELY has its serious moments, and they do NOT mess around! It may help to know that the animation was done by A-1 Pictures, known for doing anime like Sora no Woto, Sword Art Online, AnoHana, and Fractale, all with the same simple but fluid and motion-filled style of animation. Granted, some faces get distorted at times, but it's not anything that'll kill the show.\\nThe music is another area where the show shines brightly, because it also has a very unconventional soundtrack. Let's put it this way: it's basically 85% woodwind instruments, complete with FWEET noises all over...and it is awesome. All of said pieces are bouncy, happy, and cheerful sounding, completely fitting the show's bright color palette and cheerful mood. But there's still room for nice orchestral pieces and bombastic epic pieces too, all fitting their respective scenes and moods like peanut butter and jelly meshing together perfectly. I can't seem to find any flaws with it! It's the kind of music that'll stick in your head for years and never leave, and you'll find yourself whistling it forever!\\nThe characters are another great aspect of the show. There are just too many shows ripping off each other with teenagers as lead characters who all have the same personalities and archetypes: there's a shy kid, a cheerful kid, a stoic sourpuss, etc. Tsuritama, however, makes it a point to give its characters as much development and originality as possible, and they wind up growing into great characters in the process, and they don't stick to their gimmicks for long. Yuki starts off cripplingly shy, but soon he's able to speak his mind. Natsuki starts off as a jerk, but he becomes kinder later on. Haru is just too oppressively cheerful, but there's a lot more to his excessive childlike cheer than he lets on. There's also the fact that the situations they're in play out more naturally and don't come off as cheesy or ham-fisted, truly setting off their development. All of the characters are great, and because they bounce off each other and clash like the dickens, their chemistry comes off as really natural and realistic. I can see people acting the way they do in real life, and the animation really helped in bringing them to life, too.\\nI feel really bad trying to find flaws for this show, as it's the sweetest thing ever! But unfortunately, like all anime and everything else, it does have some flaws. For one thing, we never get a reason for where the heck Yuki's parents are, nor do we ever find out why he makes a demon face whenever he's anxious to the point of feeling like he's drowning. I also really didn't like Haru's Japanese voice. It got annoying hearing that overly squeaky voice...and surprisingly enough, his English dub voice improved on it in every single way! I seriously must talk about the English dub. Sentai Filmworks may not make good dubs most of the time, but when they hit, they hit REALLY hard, and Tsuritama is seriously one of the best English dubs they've made! Most of the voices are perfectly cast, the scripting is great, and it really does the show justice! I only found one major flaw with the dub, though: Sakura's voice. Nancy Novotny does her English voice, and while she isn't BAD, her voice is just too hoarse for a little kid like her, she sounds really forced, and unfortunately she misses the mark on one pivotal moment in episode 7. That, and I'm a HUGE Ogura Yui fan. That's about it. Plus, the first five episodes run at a slow pace and most of the episodes in that period are lessons on fishing, so it may test your patience quite a bit. Haru's English voice is seriously the high point of the English dub. It's like they shipped Miyu Irino off to America, made him take English for ten years, and recast him in the role, he's THAT good! You guys really need to check out the English dub! Also, my school's anime club absolutely LOVED this anime to death. We watched six straight episodes of it alongside Deadman Wonderland within two semesters!\\nIf you're looking for something sweet and colorful that'll put you in a good mood and tug at your heartstrings, fish Tsuritama out of the water!

I\\'ve been a fan since my childhood!\"\\nI most often reply to the second response by asking them what shows they like, and unfortunately, for me, I almost always receive an answer that goes something among the lines of:\\n\"Oh, I like Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Cardcaptors, Dragon Ball Z, and just about any film created by Studio Ghibli.\"\\nNow,\\nbefore I move ahead with this conversation, I just want to clarify that I don\\'t think any of the vintage classics from the 90s are terrible shows, nor do I intend to insult any of the people who are part of these fanbases. However, I feel like I do need to get something off my chest that has been bothering me for quite a while now, and it is this:\\nI don\\'t think people should really count themselves as fans of anime if all they watch is Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, etc, because let\\'s be real, that hardly qualifies as someone who loves anime. If you ask me, I\\'d say these people are more just fans of American pop culture as opposed to anime. To me, a REAL hardcore anime fan may like the following shows:\\n- Higurashi no Naku Koro No\\n- Azumanga Daioh\\n- K-on!\\n- Your Lie in April\\n- Lucky Star\\n- Lupin the Third\\n- Elfen Lied\\n- Angel Beats\\n- Another\\nSo those are just some of the popular shows within the ACTUAL anime/otaku community, but then there are those shows that are still fairly popular, but are even obscurely known by even the greatest mighty kings of otakus.\\nTsuritama....\\n.....is one of those shows.....\\nCreated by the same studio that did Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens (A-1 Pictures), this anime has a slightly bigger fan base than the latter (being in 875th place according to the popularity poll, while Kannagi ranks as being in 898th place).\\nBoth of these shows I feel deserve more popularity within the otaku community. Kannagi was released in the fall of 2008, and had quite a big following back in the late 2000s and early 2010s, but as time went on, the anime began to fade more and more into obscurity to the point where if you ask anyone if they\\'ve ever seen or heard of said show, they will just give you an awkward stare as if you have lobsters crawling out of your ears.\\nThe same thing can be said for Tsuritama, released in the spring of 2012, and had somewhat of a massive fan base back in its day. It was all the rage throughout its year of release, but as time went on, it eventually fell into the same boat as Kannagi and fewer and fewer people were discovering it.\\nOkay, enough fooling around! Let\\'s dive into my review of Tsuritama now!\\nStory - 8/10\\nThe story has quite a unique set-up. It starts off by telling a legend of a five-headed dragon who was known to terrorize the village of Enoshima, Japan until a goddess came along and scared it away. After the dragon was scared away, the village of Enoshima began to live in peace.\\nThe story then shifts its attention over to Yuki Sanada, who is a young teenage boy with really bad social anxiety and who is unable to maintain friendships, due to his grandmother frequently moving around with him a lot and transferring him to different schools. Eventually, Yuki meets a strange boy named Haru, who claims to be a fish alien.\\nAt first, Yuki has somewhat of a dislike for Haru, but as the anime progresses, the two of them manage to form a healthy friendship, with the help of Natsuki, who teaches them the basics of fishing.\\nNear the end, we begin to discover how the legend of the five-headed dragon is connected to Haru\\'s existence, but I\\'m not going to give too much away. Instead, I\\'m going to tell you what I thought of the story set-up.\\nI thought the story was very well done. It really brought me to tears when Yuki wasn\\'t sure what to think of Haru or Natsuki at first, given Haru was a bit annoying, and Natsuki was a bit rude to him at first when he was teaching him the basics of fishing, but as time went on, their stories began to unfold more and they all began to realize they were outcasts, and started to bond more by going on fishing adventures.\\nArt - 10/10\\nI\\'ve noticed that a lot of anime shows produced by A-1 Pictures have a lot of bright pretty colours. Tsuritama\\'s artwork is close to that of Fairy Tail, Kannagi, Seven Deadly Sins and Ano Hana. It is just breath-taking.\\nSound - 8/10\\nThe voice acting is good, though I think Yuki\\'s feelings of social anxiety are a bit exaggerated. As someone who has Asperger\\'s Syndrome, I can understand what it\\'s like being around unfamiliar faces, and being uncomfortable building friendships with specific individuals, but I feel like the whole image of Yuki drowning in an ocean and screaming at the top of his lungs to show off his discomfort was a bit over the top.\\nCharacters - 9/10\\nThe characters are kind of relatable. Haru is cute in the ways in which he tries to get Yuki to take a liking to him, while Yuki is reluctant to build friendships with Natsuki and Haru until he gets to know them a bit better. As someone who is on the autism spectrum, this anime really speaks to me.\\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\nThis anime was excellent, though I didn\\'t really enjoy it as much as I did Kannagi, as this one was more focussed on the slice-of-life genre, while Kannagi I felt had more plot development, but other than that, this was quite an awesome experience of an anime.\\nOverall - 9/10\\nThis anime is a must-watch. I highly recommend this to anyone within the otaku community.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsuritama taught us a valuable lesson: characters first.\\nTsuritama was first created as an original story which being immediately adapted as anime series. There was no sin in that, bear in mind. Several O-G anime series had managed to stand out and became a fixture in their own respective rights (i.e. Cowboy Bebop, Psycho-Pass, you get the gist). For Tsuritama, the premise was about Sanada Yuki, a teen with basically low EQ who got thrust into the world of seaside fishing and (heads up!) aquatic aliens. The first impression that one would definitely get might be \"well, this was a beautifully drawn anime with music that\\nwas not half bad at all-- quite enjoyable\". Unfortunately, we are not talking about drawings nor are we talking about BGM for late night studies. We are talking about anime series. Twelve episodes in, and we got a problem.\\nThe biggest flaw that Tsuritama suffers is its inability to balance the beauty and the narrative-- and the \\'meet-me-halfway\\' point between the two is supposed to be the characters. Sure, initially the protagonists got our attention (and sometimes, our sympathy as well) but there is a big difference between attracting sympathy and attracting empathy. Prolonging the former for 12 episodes, the sympathy devolves into straight-up annoyance. The hero may not have to be likable, but if he or she loses its relatability, well, that just puts the mud on the Number One rule of How To Make Anime. Even the primary hero\\'s grandmother, who should have easily been the easiest character trope to develop, ultimately comes off as tentative and insignificant.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong: we all should give props for Tsuritama for at least trying to take risks with its campy premise. Now, if only it could be more than just a memorable premise, but also a memorable anime series.\\n#felixlovesanime', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9486bf45207b0696eafe9aeeac603f1a'}>,\n",

However, I was dissapointed for the first 6 episodes. The creators try to build up the relationship between our main characters, who are relationship-challenged teenagers, but this is done in a boring fashion. Basically, no major events happened in the first half of this anime. The second half of the anime becomes much better, though.\\nThe 4 companions overcomes their own emotional issues, and work together to save the world (i won't spoil further).

That being said, there are no spectacular artwork in this anime.\\nSound: 7\\nFrankly, I didn't like the sound in this anime. The opening song is bland. The sound tracks used in this anime is appropriate in some circumstances, but out of place in other places.

Although I disliked the 4 problematic boys at first, I admired how they have grown up in the process of fishing together by the end of the anime. Basically, each of the teenager, especially Yuki and Natsuki, has a major problem that he overcame in the end. The supporting characters are also pretty well portrayed. On the other hand, none of these characters leave a lasting impression on my mind.\\nEnjoyment: 5\\nI almost give up on this anime at episode 4 or 5.

My first impression was that the show might be a slice of life like Nichijou or Azumanga but with males and fishing. Totally wrong. What seems like a non-existent plot quickly comes together to form an epic fight to save the world. At the same time Tsuritama manages to shine light on all\\naspects of life in a meaningful way, touching on life, death, friendship, finding yourself, growing up, family and departure.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Tsuritama is a science fiction comedy from 2012. It was written by Ono Toshiya and produced by A-1 Pictures. Yes, the studio that brought us Kuroshitsuji, Sword Art Online & Boku dake ga Inai Machi among others. In other words, their quality varies quite a bit. I haven't really heard anything about this anime, so I'm going into it pretty blind. Let's see how well it compares to the other A-1 anime I've reviewed.\\nStory:\\nYuki is a highly introverted lad who moves a lot. After moving to Enoshima, his life turns around. Another transfer student, Haru, comes into class and introduces himself as an alien.\\nHe then insists that Yuki go fishing with him to save the world. Shenanigans incoming.\\nThe first noticeable issue with this series is that there's a lot of technical talk on the mechanics of fishing and it's all really tedious and completely uninteresting. Look, I know that your comedy here is using fishing as its method to save the world but that doesn't mean there's anything comedic about long explanations of how to catch mahi mahi or the proper way to cast. I would go so far as to say that that time could have been better spent on amusing hijinks. Another issue is that the series doesn't really take full advantage of the comedic possibilities of its premise. This is a series about aliens who can control humans with water and an alien teaming up with some humans to save the world by fishing. That's a premise that's so patently ridiculous that it shouldn't be that hard to make laughs happen. But they downplay the comedic elements in favour of teaching us the mechanics of fishing.\\nThat being said, those moments where they do embrace the absurdity tend to work pretty well. The funniest scenes all centre around Haru too. I will also say that some of the quieter, emotional moments are, surprisingly, really good. The scene where Yuki tells his grandmother how much she means to him in particular.\\nCharacters:\\nTsuritama is a bit unusual in the regard that the major characters really vary. Haru is good for comedic scenes but not so much for anything more serious. Yuki can work in both, but has his strongest scenes in the more serious moments. Natsuki largely plays the straight man in the comedic bits and works better for the more emotional moments. Akira is just a flat, predictable character. The side characters largely exist to play off of the main cast and provide them with strong moments. The only ones who really stand out are Yuki's grandmother and Natsuki's father & sister.\\nArt:\\nThe artwork is pretty well done. There's a lot of effort put into making the water, fish and fishing equipment look polished. The character designs are a bit lacklustre, but functional. The animation is solidly done.\\nSound:\\nThe acting is pretty solid. We've got the talents of Irino Miyu, Osaka Ryota, Sugita Tomokazu, Uchiyama Kouki & various others. The performances are generally good for what they're doing. They can carry the comedic parts and sound like they're reading from the world's dullest instruction manual when explaining the mechanics of fishing or repeating them to show us that their character understands them. Osaka Ryota does a great job with the emotional stuff. The music is okay. Probably not anything I'd listen to again, but it's functional.\\nHo-yay:\\nThere are some moments betwixt Yuki and Haru where I question whether they're really just friends but there aren't many.\\nFinal Thoughts:\\nUltimately, Tsuritama is a series that has its charming and funny moments but it's also a bit of a slog with stretches of tedium to get through before reaching those moments. In the end, its good moments elevate it above mediocrity, but it's not a superb series. It's just okay. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If you really love the mechanics of fishing, you'll probably like it better than I did.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Being able to relate to the main character on the basis of being a socially awkward individual, I decided to give this anime a chance. I was more than pleasantly surprised.\\nI can understand why this isn't a top anime, it has its many, many flaws but the characters is not one of them. From the main character who is introduced as a young boy with the inability to hold social interactions and develop relationships, to his sick grandmother who supports him and provides the young boy with comfort and a honey coated tongue. All the characters are well thought out and have a great sense\\nof depth as seen throughout the summer in which they are seen; we able able to see them grow and develop. These characters surprise us in more ways we can count, they are not predictable nor are they exactly alike other characters we have previously seen in similar genres.\\nThe way the characters interact with one another is entertaining and sometimes very realistic. They can be relatable in a way that you can link your own experiences to them and form a special type of bond as you can imagine yourself in their shoes, going through the same situations. Obviously with the supernatural themes it was harder to relate at some points, however the overcasting theme of the importance of friendship and good relationships was prevalent in many of these scenes which was another of its strong points as you could still understand where the characters where coming from.\\nHowever the actual story line was where the quality of the anime dropped considerably. Though it was well paced at most times, there were certain points where it really lacked in the art of story telling. Additionally, all the themes mixed together lead to a childish plot near the ending, one in which the viewer was unable to take the story seriously as it lacked depth. Despite this, there were some very high points where the story would bring tears to my eyes and warmth to my heart, though it was simplistic at times but this did not stop the message from coming across.\\nThe art was extremely appealing and was another factor that I was initially drawn to. It was simplistic in a way that was visually  pleasing and is recognisable due to the unique techniques used. The main setting was the sea and the way it was portrayed in this anime definitely didn't disappoint, everything from the fish to the reflection of the sun across the water made the visuals a great success for this anime, it was memorable and well done. It did a great job of adding to the story rather than taking away from it or being a distracting turn-off.\\nI particularly liked the opening and ending theme songs for this anime, they added very well to the story and they represented it very well with the opening being more upbeat and catchy and the ending more relaxing and soothing. The background music fit the situations well as they were not overly distracting, however they did not stand out well enough to be particularly noteworthy. The voices fit the characters well and was another strong point for the anime. They were each distinctive and portrayed the characters in their unique ways that gave them another layer of depth and realistic attributes.\\nOverall this story of overcoming hardships and anxiety, creating friends and having an adventure whilst fishing was a highly pleasing one that I would definitely recommend. It is a truly underrated anime that should be given more credit for its characters and development. It lingers on its main themes in a way that is intuitive and forces the viewers to reflect. This is an anime that would be enjoyed by most that gave it a chance.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e905e7811c67234803295f810b522c6e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"After finishing Tsuritama, I felt compelled to write a review. This anime managed to grasp me more than any other sports anime I've watched so far (though all I've watched is Free! and part of Haikyuu!! currently). It has the same sequence as the others: people who have their odds but have to come together in the end for a common goal. But the characterization in this one made it special to me.\\nStory and Character: 10\\nI'm doing these together because I couldn't write about them apart. I liked that this wasn't some romantic relationship based show where the shy boy meets a girl who changes\\nhim. The way it happened, not just by accident but by deliberate choice on the outgoing boy's part, was funny, The story wouldn't have unfolded the same if it had been up to fate or by accident due to the main character's (Yuki) stifling fear of interaction with people. Haru was this breath of fresh air because he wasn't just some outgoing, cute character who changed everyone in town. The way he struggled to interact with or like a human was different than the usual half animal struggles so it gave him a new special aspect and his goal of the show along with how he developed throughout and his interactions with Keiko, Yuki's grandma, gave him depth.\\nNatsuki was the brooding character of the series but I think the best part about him was the family aspect of his character. He softened pretty quickly towards Yuki and Haru, even once in the first episode because of his sister around. But with him there was more for him to deal with than the fishing and that was dealing with loss and staying with his family. His growth was based here and that was the most important thing to him.\\nYuki had all the personal growth of the series left to him. He had obstacles and hurdles and barrels of things to get past before he could be the greater person in episode 12.\\nKeiko was really just cute and quirky and a great voice of wisdom throughout the series. She'd be the coolest grandma and I'm glad she was one of the main parental figures for both Haru and Yuki.\\nArt: 9\\nThe art in this one was cool and fun. It was super generic or cookie-cutter like many animes can be and they did something a little different that worked with the flow and feel of the story. The quirky style was a great addition to the whole package.\\nSound: 8\\nThe music throughout was cute and went along with the show well.\\nI felt overwhelmed, as I still do, with love for this series. It wasn't like the other sports animes I've watched where everything is really intense and emotional. It was an upbeat, funny chance and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I hope I can find more comedic sports animes like this one because it was just a nice feel good show that I would recommend to anyone.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'cd9cbca185b72f94f9dd7f656461d367'}>,\n",

Except for Haru, the other main characters aren\\'t really the friendly type, but they will soon learn the meaning of friendship. I truly enjoyed how the anime concentrated on developing the characters and teaching them lessons about life, friendship and fishing.\\nAs you may know, art&sound reviews aren\\'t really that good but I will try my best.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'It is rare to find a story that seems both entirely implausible and out-of-this-world, yet still manages to be easily grasped by the most average of players. Tsuritama is a diamond in the rough, indeed. As the story begins to unfold following Yuki, a boy who is both endearing and relatable, Tsuritama doesn\\'t hold back its true colors. The art is bright and magnificent, the music is like rafting down a stream with a faithful companion, and the humor is unashamed, full of quirk--and the understanding that sometimes everyone feels like they\\'re drowning in a sea.\\nOn one hand, the story moves so effortlessly that\\nit is easy to forget that there is a wide-eyed boy claiming to be an alien running amok. Though, on the other hand, between a self-proclaimed alien and a mysterious man who talks to his duck, it can be just as easily forgotten that the story is, above all, about a few unlikely friends who are simply going fishing. The craft of story telling is mastered beautifully in Tsuritama. Even among the moments of concentrated fishing, there is never a feeling of doubt that this isn\\'t just fishing--it\\'s more, and that propels the story to move at an easy pace--ultimately too quickly by the series\\' end.\\nWhat ultimately shines in Tsuritama are the characters.

In true coming-of-age fashion, the boys are confronted with real-life issues of death, family, and friendship. The interactions between Yuki\\'s grandmother and innocent, self-proclaimed alien Haru are some of the most poignant, as he learns about the inevitability of goodbye and the frailty of the human spirit.\\nTsuritama is an artistic gem. It is not by any means an \"average\" slice of life, nor is it too fantastical to be grasped.

Nothing much to say in this department, so compliments to the design team. For\\nthe most part the art is well done with the use of bright colors emitting the surrounding and characters. One specific character... and that\\'s Haru enthralled me especially with his outfits.\\nSound: Now this is what makes Tsuritama almost perfect... its music. With no negativity whatsoever the music is done well in that it does not fail to capture the feeling of hanging out on an island- if you get what I mean. Truth is, I\\'ve never been to enoshima nor have I ever went fishing, but the surrounding plus the music makes it all feel fresh and not boring... a good way pass time REALLY!\\nCharacter: Yuki *Claps *Claps Sorry, its just so beautiful to see a character like Yuki grow almost like how beautiful it is seeing a plant sprout and grow into a beautiful flower.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsuritama is a story about fishing first and foremost. This is pretty obvious on the outset given the title and synopsis, but I say this in a very straightforward way. Tsuritama is about fishing, and that becomes a strength as well as a weakness in the show. Let\\'s \"dive\" right in.\\nCharacters/Story\\nTsuritama has four main characters, each with their own little quirks and personalities as well as goals throughout the story. The first half of the story is quite lovely and got my hopes up for the rest of the show to be just like that. The initial protagonist Yuki struggling to fit in and overcoming\\nhis social anxiety through fishing really felt like it was a show about how Haru\\'s worldview and overall attitude changes as he discovers more about fishing. Unfortunately about half way through is when the side plot of the aliens kicks into full gear and almost quite literally swallows the show whole. By itself the alien plot isn\\'t terrible, but it nearly completely overshadows any character development that Yuki gets and doesn\\'t feel tied in with his struggles very well. It starts to course correct at the end, but by then it\\'s hard to care as much as in the beginning. The neat visual metaphors and whatnot in the beginning are nearly gone by the end, making me wonder if this show would have worked better being two separate ones\\nThe characters are generally fun, although if you dislike high pitched anime boy yelling you\\'ll probably dislike Haru for the first few episodes before he calms down in pitch. The strongest character by far is Yuki, who receives a bulk of the overall development and really the one who has changed the most in the end. Natsuki is fun to see loosen up over time (even with some questionable moments near the middle). Yamada...honestly feels like such a waste in this story. His character is alright but they really force him into the trio of Y/H/N without giving him a ton to do until the end.\\nArt\\nTsuritama has a colorful, oceany palette and a pleasing artstyle overall. Characters appear off-model enough times to be noticed but this is balanced out by a few surprise sakuga scenes and interesting use of camera movements. The art and animation are generally serviceable (with props to the drawings of Haru\\'s \"demon face\" which always felt like it conveyed that expression so perfectly for me).\\nSound\\nTsuritama has quite a few lovely background tracks that really emulate a sort of small town beach vibe that blends great with the series. I would say at times I was even paying more attention to the background music than the show, at least enough to want to look up tracks later on. The op is bright and poppy, while the ed is a bit more melancholy, both which I think represent some of the feelings the show is going for and add to the beachy vibe.\\nOverall\\nTsuritama is hard to recommend seriously. I admire the first half a ton for the themes it\\'s trying to touch on and the visual metaphors it uses to portray them. Where is gets lost for me is when it decides to almost completely abandon those ideas in favor for a far less interesting and investing side plot. If you enjoy colorful and fun anime about the powers of friendship and fishing, you\\'ll probably enjoy this one quite a bit. Otherwise, you don\\'t really have to bother unless you want something to breeze through on a slow day.\\n~Howl', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bbcc272c04e3d08ba3b7db96e58480e8'}>,\n",

At first it seemed slice-of-life which I'm used to watching, but it also had lots of random parts when Haru entered the story, which was refreshing. The way the characters came together and interacted was pretty quick, and I liked that in a small-town setting.The best part is watching the\\ncharacters warm up to each other and develop by solving their problems together, such as Natsuki with his family. Everything is relatively calm until around the 7th episode, and then I realized 'ok now it's getting serious'. As for Haru's gun-pointing, I understand that it might look 'cool' to some people; it doesn't promote violence because it was just a water gun but I just feel a little off about it. However, whenever Haru used it I imagined him as a spoiled child, but it is his weapon. Scenes where Natsuki taught them how to fish were interesting to learn too. Overall it was short, but I felt that every scene was important, either for plot or for enjoyment. I'm glad there wasn't anything too serious in here, like violence, death or any of that stuff, but you can still take it seriously. Happy endings are yay :)\\nI instantly fell in like with Yuki. I could relate to his awkwardness so easily that I just wanted to cheer him on even though I laughed at his reactions to his moments.

I especially like how he brought Yuki out, from being a bit of a loner to a guy with a small group of good friends sharing a passion for fishing. The best part is that, although he isn't an alien, they don't make him a complete idiot either. THANK YOU. Natsuki was a little hard to understand; I thought he was a complete nerd but he was actually a serious guy. I understood how he felt  with his family's situation and I don't blame him. He's especially..funny when he's with his sister. I sometimes forgot Akira's age when he was hanging out with the others, but he was an ok guy too. His stiffness made him a little more interesting, and his relationship with Tapioca is just...cute. They're all fun characters.\\nSound? That means the theme and ending song right? Both are equally awesome and I completely understand when people encourage you not to skip them..so don't! They both fit the mood - the beginning gets you all hyped as you anticipate the episode, and the end song completes it with a soothing finish. The music in the anime was good too~relaxing\\nThe art - bright colours! I love bright colours! I normally find other animes bland because of their pale, pasty colours, but the colour done in here made everything more lifelike. Like Haru, I'm also fond of Yuki's hair, haha. The animation is great, things are always moving around...I can almost feel the effort as I'm watching it. I also have a strange satisfaction when I get to see the sky and the water in the anime..because it's blue! The characters' expressions were great as well (esp Yuki's face of course). And..fish!!! The last episode is the best episode to see fish ;D\\nThe whole thing was amusing to watch. As for reactions, I was was biting my lip, squealing in despair, laughing out loud or just smirking. I didn't need to rely on to the humor or anything in particular to be interested, I was literally...hooked!! But mind you, I didn't pick an anime about fishing to inspire me to go fishing. Now I'm going to re-watch it again consecutively so that I can take it all in ^^\\nHow is a fish supposed to feel when it goes fishing?\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e92dd008aca3fdee450198cedb82d15e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Let me start by saying that this is my first formal review and I chose Tsuritama because it is fresh in my mind, and there wasn't a single moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while watching it. No, I didn't give it mostly 10's across the board because I'm a generally positive person. I gave it almost all 10's because I honestly believe it deserved it.\\nStory: 10\\nThe plot, concept, and originality.\\nTsuritama has a plot that may originally come off as simple and not worth the time. An anime about fishing? Sitting on a dock, boat, beach and waiting for a fish to bite? If you\\nthink about it that way Tsuritama may not be the most appealing to some people, but if you discovered it the way I did, the atmosphere it gives off is alluring. I went into watching it completely clueless as to what awaited me in these 12 episodes. The concept had me from the very beginning. Yes, there was fishing but it wasn't in the least uninteresting. It was actually quite exciting.  Now, combine that with aliens? For as long as I'm around, I would've never thought of an anime combining fishing and aliens. And not the stereotypical aliens either. There's nothing new under the sun, but combining this idea of extraterrestrial life and sport came pretty close for me. I wasn't at all expecting some of the twists thrown in there but they weren't jarring enough to be repelling. The originality of it was almost striking.\\nArt: 10\\nThe colors, style, and animation.\\nI am one to love a nice bright variety of colors, so I may be a bit biased, but it really was this selection of colors that drew me in. Add that to the unique art style and it was almost hypnotizing. I was captivated by all the different shades and brilliant hues exercised within the art without being hard to look at. It was a very nice variation from the darker animes I watch that use mostly a pallet based off of varying shades of black or other ominous, shady colors. The coloring brightened the atmosphere and made it generally more comfortable and more enjoyable. As for the style, I, myself, have tried to mimic it without very much success which usually isn't the case. It is simplistic in a way, but also quite detailed when it comes down to the tack and gear. Now, I will say, it may just be my computer, but I did find the animation to be a bit choppy in some places.\\nSound: 9\\nThe opening and ending themes, soundtrack, and voicing.\\nI don't think there was even an episode where I dared to skip to the opening theme. Combined with the art, I'd say the theme song is perfection. I didn't pay too much attention to the end though, as I was eager to move on to the next episode. I did really get to enjoy the ending theme though on the last episode before the afterward. Usually, I pay much attention to the soundtracks playing in the background. In Tsuritama I found it difficult to do. The art, and subtitles distracted me from really giving it too much thought. That and the fact that it just blended right in with the anime. In this case, that's a good thing as it boosted the pleasant atmosphere and went very smoothly with the rest of the effects and voices.\\nAs for the voice acting, I'd have to say it was average. My expectations weren't previously set by a manga version, so all the voices seemed to go with the characters nicely. The only thing thing that bothered me, and perhaps the sole reason this category received a nine was the fact that there'd occasionally be a scene where the voices were either not expressive enough or too expressive, more so the later.\\nCharacter: 10\\nThe design and development.\\nI enjoyed the characters' designed as none of the main characters had a generic design. Haru has a unique appearance, background, personality, and wardrobe which I find to be pleasant. While there are other characters with similar personality traits out there, Haru does these little things that set him apart from those other characters, whether it be noise making or otherwise. And how many characters do you know like Yuki? Bright red hair, a troll face, awkward voiceovers and behavior, and the fact that he makes up these scenarios where he's drowning when socializing or being the center of attention. Other than his name, his character just radiating uniqueness. Now Natsuki may first appear like some generic student, serious, wears glasses but his grouchy attitude definitely spiced things up. Now we come to Akira. I have seen other characters similar to his, but what defines him is Tapioca, his duck. As for the character development, Tsuritama had a lot of it. A majority of the development was done by Yuki and Natsuki. Gradually Yuki became more comfortable and gained courage thanks to Haru forcing him into being social.  Natsuki too changed throughout the course of the anime, going from cold and grumpy to more open. The other characters grew too, just in less obvious ways.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nAs I've said, after watching so many intense, depressing, and dark animes I thoroughly enjoyed Tsuritama. The characters were entertaining, funny, adorable and I felt like this anime was definitely worth my time. In fact I regret not watching it earlier! It's definitely my feel-good anime of the year.\\nOverall: 10\\nGreat, original story, great original characters, unique art, wonderful opening and by far one of the most satisfying animes. For an anime with only twelve episodes too, they really pulled it off well and ended it well without rushing it. It was so heartwarming it was impossible for me to not enjoy it. I look forward to re-watching it when I have the time.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '94e6e46de9388dbf038e3e02d8b5c9d'}>,\n",

I expected this to be an anime about casual fishing but it went from cute and light hearted to something that's intense, a bit dark and has actual story plot. Tsuritama is an anime that teaches you about friendships and building trust you have with one another.\\nHowever, there were some scenes I do not agree with which is that scene where it seems like Natsuki is at fault during his birthday.\\nLastly, ended off on a good and cute note showing what the characters are doing 6 months later and\\na mini flashback kind of scene from episode 1.\\nCharacter: 8\\nYuki's face when he's nervous or scared really made me not want to watch the anime. But after he managed to overcome his anxiety problems and became more confident, I started to like him as a character as well.\\nHaru was annoying me with his carefree attitude, commenting and bugging Yuki so much in the beginning. Later on, he's a very thoughtful, cute and caring character which my heart felt touched by him.\\nNatsuki, voiced by the seiyuu that voiced Tsukishima Kei from Haikyuu. Both of them even kind of resemble each other xD Seems like a douchey person at first does not take the viewer too long to like him as well as he turned out to be a great friend and kind person too.\\nAhh Akira, my favourite character in this anime, voiced by the seiyuu which voiced for Gintoki in Gintama. I did not like him at first as well as I thought he might hurt Haru.

However, I endured and as it progresses, I'm glad I did not stop watching it. This is also one of the few animes that shows not all aliens are evil. There are cute moments, funny moments and sad moments throughout this anime. But sometimes, the anime breaks the serious moments with a small gag which I don't know if it's a good idea or not.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsuritama- 8/10\\nGenres: Comedy, Slice of Life, Sci-Fi, Sports\\nPlot-8/10: Tsuritama takes place in a small fishing community called Enoshima. Here, the main character, Yuki, makes three unique friends: an alien, a fishing protégé, and a member of a secret agency (and his duck, Tapioca). Over the course of 12 episodes, Yuki learns how to fish and for the first time experiences true friendship and pure fun.\\nHaving never watched an anime about fishing, I enjoyed the unique premise. I appreciate that the anime takes its time to explain certain things about fishing (most times through dialogue), like the importance of using the right lure, how\\nto get better accuracy, etc. This information isn’t all thrown right in the audience’s face, but dispersed throughout, avoiding long and boring info-dump scenes.\\nNear the end of the anime, the atmosphere changes quite drastically. It feels more like an intense action anime than it does a slice of life anime. This change of pace does not come out of the blue, as it was built up with foreshadowing since the beginning of the anime.\\nArt- 9/10: From the start, the art is what attracted me and had me glued to Tsuritama. Its bright colors and attractive character designs caught my attention. The backgrounds were drawn with simplicity, yet were very pretty and created a strong setting. The ocean was especially beautiful. The animation was also good, though great like the art.\\nAudio- 8/10: The opening is very catchy and upbeat, setting the general mood of the anime. The ending is likewise cheerful. The voice actors put on compelling performances, especially Yuki’s. With so much emotion put into each role, it is easy to get attached to the characters and get caught up in their moments of joy, melancholy, excitement, and anger. The soundtrack was nothing I’d call memorable though it does accompany the animation and pacing of the anime quite nicely.\\nCharacters- 10/10: The main cast of characters is diverse and interesting. Each of the four main characters gets development and defining moments.\\nFirst, there is Yuki, the socially awkward kid who is constantly moving from place to place. Because of this, he does not have any friends and is very shy. Despite being timid, he is a fast and adept learner and appreciates his newfound friends. Many can relate to his reserved nature, including me (though not as bad as his), making him a character we care for.\\nThen there is Haru, the alien who has a mission to carry out on Earth. Haru, not knowing anything about how humans work, is susceptible to making mistakes. He does not understand human emotions like anger, or ideas like trust. Still, Haru is always looking out for the people he cares about and makes an effort to keep them happy.\\nNext is Natsuki, a native of Enoshima. Nicknamed “Fishing Prince”, he is very skilled and disciplined. He at first seems arrogant and douchey, but develops as he spends time with Yuki and the others.\\nLastly, there is Akira, a member of a secretive agency. There is not much to say about him without spoilers, other than he is of Indian descent and carries a duck named Tapioca everywhere he goes.\\nEffectiveness- 8/10: Like all comedy anime, it is either a hit or a miss. I found some parts to be funny, while others were over the top or even “cringy”. A lot of the comedy comes from Haru’s silly antics and curiosity.\\nThe pacing was on point for the majority if not all of the anime. The suspense and build up to the climax was great and had me eager for the next episode. No part of the anime feels wasted as each scene either moves the story forward or develops the characters.\\nEverything comes together to give the audience a unique viewing experience, filled with laughs, excitement, and even a few tears.\\nOverall- 8.6/10: Tsuritama, an anime that conveys the importance and beauty of friendship through the sport of fishing, is one hidden gem. With stunning art, moving voice acting, and relatable characters, it is enjoyable from start to finish.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2d36acfd36bacf52533f4df1f880ed15'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Let me just start off by saying I don't normally do reviews. However, after just finishing the final episode I feel strongly compelled to do so.\\nI seen this anime appear on recommended lists many of times, however based off of the sypnosis, I passed it off many times. Now that I've finished it, my only regret is the fact I never watched this sooner. You can read this as it contains no spoilers.\\nCharacters:\\nThe very first thing I noticed about this anime right off the bat was the characters. Not once was I ever bored with a single one of them. Infact, I found\\nmyself highly intrigued with every single one instead of just a select few like I do in most animes. What caught me off guard was how unique and quirky they all were. Most animes tend to do so in a way which I find annoying and repetitive, however in this one it wasn't bothersome at all and made me grow to love them even more. From Haru's usual antics, Yuki freaking out from his social anxiety, to Akira and Tapioca being downright ridiculous, they helped pull me out of my depression just for a while and laugh for the first time and days. I highly recommend this series if you need something to pick you up.\\nSound:\\nThe music was great. I grew to love the opening as time went on, and by the end of the series I found myself singing the Enoshima dance song, and even wanting to do the dance myself! I didn't notice a flaw with it as I was so into the story and characters.\\nArt:\\nAnother thing I noticed right away was the anime style. Though I typically am not picky with that, I did like it and found it very pretty with how simple and relaxing it was. As far as I could tell the animation was fine, I saw no mistakes and again, was too enraptured in the characters and story to notice.\\nStory:\\nI expected it to be a boring show solely about fishing. I never expected it to turn out the way it did! And when Haru was talking about certain things at the beginning I never actually took him seriously! Well boy was I proven wrong. I've never seen an anime like this, and I've watched over 200, so I'd say in my perspective it was quite original. The plot twists were unexpected and every episode just had me wanting more and more. If theres one thing that this anime has taught me, it's to not judge an anime based off of its sypnosis! In other words, things aren't always what they seem to be.\\nEnjoyment:\\nI think it's quite obvious how much I enjoyed this!\\nOverall:\\nI give this anime a 10/10. I enjoyed it and there wasn't a second that I wasn't bored with it. I found myself ignoring messages just to keep watching more!

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsuritama feels like something studio SHAFT would make, as it has weird artsy animation and characters that are or act like they are aliens.\\n- And yet it is not made by SHAFT but rather by A-1 Works, which translates to good production values.\\n- It is also part of the NoitanimA timeslot, so it is bound to have lots of artistic makeup and josei overtones.\\n- And it’s by Nakamura Kenji, the director of Mononoke, Kuuchu Buranko, and C, so expect some really crazy stuff in it.\\nSTORY\\nMy impressions about the plot were just one big MEH as there was literally no real hook in the story. It\\nis supposed to be about making friends and fishing being the key to the salvation of the Earth but it is not motivational or educational or exciting or whatever. It is easy going right away and doesn’t try to have peaks of tension just to flavour the whole thing. Even the finale that is supposed to be one big major event is presented in a most easy going way. Just imagine that instead of panicking because of a major catastrophe, the people are dancing happily in the middle of the street.\\nCHARACTERS\\nI didn’t find the characters to be very funny or inspiring. The “earth people” felt and acted like they were bored half the time and kept their distance from you like they were afraid of something. There wasn’t any specific reason for not wanting to open up, they were just bored or anti-social. And this is where the “alien people” come up and motivate them to learn fishing, as means to make friends, be more social … and save the world in some ludicrous way. They are supposed to be a complete antithesis with the earthlings but because of the easy going nature of the show they didn’t manage to polarize their attitudes that much. Everybody’s personality was quite basic and simple and the whole “I’m an alien” thing that was supposed to keep things interesting, got old years ago.\\nA notice must be given to Yuki, the protagonist, who is anti-social and gets these panic attacks when pressed to do something. He is supposed to be your average blunt closet teenager we are to identify with. Although it is kinda funny to see him acting like he is drowning or about to blow up, I eventually disliked how everything seems to revolve around him, and happening just for him. The aliens are constantly pressing him to learn fishing because he is the chosen one or something, and he catches fish with no real talent. It gets quickly annoying if you don’t like anti-social people and convenient events.\\nAnother notice must be given to the alien Haru’s water pistol. Yes, his pistol, not him, whom I want to strangle for acting like a coo-coo all the time . It brainwashes people to do anything he tells them to. This alone trashes all sense of free will and the whole bonding and friendship part turns to nothing but puppets controlled by Haru’s strings. So much for motivation.\\nAs for the rest of the characters, they don’t matter much to the main plot. I mean there is this Hindu dude and his duck partner, and they are supposed to be part of a shady organization but the whole thing is there just for kicks. There is also Haru’s sister who is there just for fan service; she otherwise behaves exactly like him. And some other denizens of the island, like relatives and other schoolmates who are there to flesh out the setting and give it a fluffy atmosphere between slice of life and romantic comedy. The show focuses on them nicely, so they are not cardboards.\\nART\\nI fancied the artwork for its uncommon and stylish looks. A weird blend of paperwork and water paints, with simplistic caricatures and vivid colours to make everything look like you are high on drugs. It keeps the eye occupied all the time with all the trippy things in it.\\nI disliked the animation. Not only there wasn’t much motion, but also because everything felt dumb. The way they keep shaking their hands and head felt half-dead compared to how extreme they are supposed to behave. It doesn’t feel exaggerated enough and that tends to make it dull to keep looking after awhile. And seriously, when one guy is talking or thinking, everybody else just freezes and waits for him to finish instead of doing anything else. It made it look very staged and artificial. Especially when the lead male is looking at his Pokedex … I’m sorry, I mean his amazing cell phone that has a whole wikipedia in it. Every time a new fishing-related word is spoken, he picks up his phone and looks for the explanation. This is quite a dull way of explaining things since all we see is letters and an internal monologue. Where is the interest in a still image where he reads and thinks about it, while every other character present patiently awaits for him to finish as if they await the approval of the king in order to move to the next scene. BOOORING!\\nMUSIC\\nVoice acting and dialogues were fine but because of the lack of proper bodily motions, they too weren’t as passionate as they could have been. Other than that, everybody talks in a comical way and especially Haru is so cheerful you just want to shoot him.\\nThe background music was crap. They just threw a soft tune in the background and left the characters talking however they liked. There was very little effort given to make the music be in tune with whatever is going on in the foreground.\\nThe music themes were soft lullabies full of flute tunes. Although fitting to the show’s mood they are not something memorable or good enough to not skip when they appear.\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nSo what do I think of this show as a whole?\\n- It’s TOO DAMN TAMED! Completely easy going compared to what the same director has produced in the past. With such a bizarre premise and quirky artwork, you would expect it to be far more exciting that this lukewarm slice of life. It’s one of those shows you watch to ease your mind by not thinking much, instead of sleeping, watching commercials on television, or looking at the cars crossing the road outside your house. BOOORING! I don’t watch anime to fall asleep but to get my blood pumping and my brain working. Tsuritama felt to me like a dull variant of Sayonara Zetsubo or FLCL.\\n- Even the whole premise of making friends through fishing is not working out. FISHING IS A BORING HOBBY! All you do is shake a rod, keep quiet, and hope for a dumb fish to bite the lure. Even Bayblade felt more interesting to this and it was just about spinning tops.\\n- And even if it was trying to be about opening up and making friends, it is still boring compared to NHK, Princess Jellyfish, or even Boku wa Tomodachi. And brainwashing people to do your biding on top of everything else? Well thanks for trashing your own premise just like that.\\nSUGGESTION LIST\\nAliens: Arakawa under the Bridge, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, Level E\\nAnti-socials: NHK, Princess Jellyfish, Boku wa Tomodachi\\nAnd now for some excused scorings.\\nART SECTION: 8/10\\nGeneral Artwork 2/2 (artsy)\\nCharacter Figures 1/2 (generic)\\nBackgrounds 2/2 (artsy)\\nAnimation 1/2 (basic)\\nVisual Effects 2/2 (artsy)\\nSOUND SECTION: 7/10\\nVoice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)\\nMusic Themes 3/4 (not great but fitting with the feeling of the series)\\nSound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)\\nSTORY SECTION: 3/10\\nPremise 0/2 (stupid)\\nPacing 1/2 (slow)\\nComplexity 1/2 (not much)\\nPlausibility 0/2 (none)\\nConclusion 1/2 (cheesy)\\nCHARACTER SECTION: 7/10\\nPresence 2/2 (funny)\\nPersonality 2/2 (silly but well founded)\\nBackdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)\\nDevelopment 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)\\nCatharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)\\nVALUE SECTION: 4/10\\nHistorical Value 0/3 (none)\\nRewatchability 1/3 (low because of too little plot)\\nMemorability 3/4 (weird enough to bother remembering it)\\nENJOYMENT SECTION: 3/10\\nArt 1/1 (looks artsy)\\nSound 0/2 (sounds boring)\\nStory 0/3 (feels stupid)\\nCharacters 2/4 (cute but nothing much)\\nVERDICT: 5.5/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4df9c9b43fa7f847312622ec39bcc029'}>,\n",

The island is depicted so beautifully that I really want to go on a vacation there\\n\"Great\" 9/10\\nSound: One song you will hear almost every Episode is the song of the Enoshima-dance. Haino haino haino~ yoisho yoishona~. The soundtrack is very heart-warming and befitting, I would not have it any other way. \"very good\" 8/10\\nCharacter: The characters are outstanding. I escpecially loved the character developement of the main character Yuki, and Natsuki. At first you will probably hate Haru, and maybe you will do so until Episode 8 or 9...but in the end you should also come to know how valuable he really is. And Akira and his duck tapioca also give us a lot of comic relief. But maybe Akira and DUCK were the things that bothered me the most. Still, the characters were \"outstanding\" 10/10\\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it a lot, and it didn\\'t even take me a week to finish this Anime. I liked every Episode of it. \"Great\" 9/19\\nOverall I will still \\'only\\' give it an 8 \"very good\", because the story could have been less over-the-top, escpecially towards the end. Still I would recommend this to everyone who wants a heart-warming story of friendsship and family.\\n8/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '79cae03722bdc35fe06ed6bf3e7be4c5'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'There is a reason this is considered to be one of the greatest anime series ever made.  Take a healthy dose of outlaw vigilantism from the wild west, combine it with all your favorite pirate fantasy escapades, put it on a vaguely WWII-era stylized battleship, and set it in space.  If you replace the six-shooter revolvers with plasma lasers that can double as rapiers, replace the battleship guns with ultra-powerful “pulsar cannons”, and replace the high seas and prevailing winds with gravitational anomalies and solar radiation, what will remain is about what you’ve got with Space Pirate Captain Harlock.  Add one of\\nthe most endearing and enduring characters anime ever produced, and this is the series you’ll end up with.  It even comes complete with a seemingly-unstoppable alien invasion, a lush back story to fill out the appropriate pacing measures, and a gunfight/dogfight/fistfight in nearly every episode!\\nThe animation is surprisingly good for its time.  You can certainly expect reuse of footage, along with sometimes-choppy transitions or movements, but it holds up fine today provided you’ve got an appreciation for older animation.  There are some slight errors in how the cells are layered (one of which includes lights illogically going through Harlock’s slightly-transparent chest, for instance), but all of them are minor, brief, and they don’t interrupt the flow/continuity at all.\\nThe story is classic.  Perhaps typical of Leiji Matsumoto, the story is a hardcore adventure tale, taking all the aesthetics & themes of the wild west, high seas, and last frontier and blending them together into a wonderful story of loss, vengeance, desperation, and hope.\\nThe directing is well-done for its time as well, though in some ways this shouldn’t be TOO much of a surprise (considering it was directed by none other than Rin Taro, who also directed another one of Matsumoto’s big-titles, the Galaxy Express 999 movie, among others).  Framing techniques, contrast, use of forced perspective, and generally well-placed shots are used to wonderful affect; add to the table his proficient editing and it isn’t hard to see why he receives praise.\\nThe soundtrack is easily one of the most memorable to date, bringing the atmosphere, writing, and directing into a cohesive whole with its western-style instrumentation and tone.  It uses music to blend together the themes of hopelessness and despair with the constant heroism, lonesomeness, and melancholy that exemplify the tone of the series, as well as the crew of the Arcadia and the oppressors they fight against.\\nSo… why a 9 instead of a 10?  To be honest, it was a tough call to make.  In fairness, I believe that it deserves the 10 for its time, however, even by today’s somewhat retro-standards, I think there were a few things that it “could have done better”.  The characters, while perfectly suited to their setting, atmosphere, and interactions, will fail to live up to many audiences’ ‘modern’ standards of development.  The story may come off as contrived to some, possibly two-dimensional with only a few remarkable plot twists to others.  The way the narrative takes its time fleshing out its history may cause some to complain about its pace.  And of course there are the rather dated issues of character models, backgrounds, and general animation quality.  I personally believe that these things are not “faults” or “failings” of the show at all; rather, I think they simply serve to highlight how well the show sculpted an epic narrative out of the varying resources, tools, and ideals it had at its disposal.\\nThe 10 it deserves implies that nearly everyone will enjoy this title, which sadly isn’t true.  It’s dated qualities will no doubt turn many away, and it’s superficially two-dimensional story may ward off those unwilling to see some of the more subtle things going on under the surface.  It has aged surprisingly well in spite of this, however, or perhaps because of it—Captain Harlock’s determined, stoic, resourceful, courageous, and only slightly brooding character has been impersonated, regurgitated, and repeated many times at this point, but even when this archetype is reiterated well, it always fails to live up to the original.  Harlock is one of a kind, and Space Pirate Captain Harlock is similarly one of a kind.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1d43bf1aa97204c58318e108c1bb51e2'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'To me, 1978 is a special year in anime. We got so many good anime; I just have to watch them all. Of course, when someone says there is an anime about space pirates and by Leiji Matsumoto (Yamato series), shut up and take my money. It was also directed by Rin Taro, whom has directed many shows from Astro Boy Brave in Space to the 1999 X Movie. Basically, his stuff is a coin flip. Luckily this anime did not disappoint.\\nSet in 2977, this is a world where technology does most of the work like in The Jetsons, and humans have become so lazy\\nand relaxed like in Disney’s Wall-E. However, when a foreign “blue” alien invading race is bent on conquering Earth for their own reasons (sounds familiar), there stands only one man and his crew... Captain Harlock with his “strange” crew on the massive battleship Arcadia.\\nMuch like in Yamato, the alien invader is incredibly interesting. However, unlike in Yamato, the characters are also fairly interesting with some development and decent enough back stories. However, when it came to deep explanations, deep back stories, deep anything, this is where the anime lacked the most. The viewer always felt like some episodes that became “destroy the alien ship of week” could have easily been replaced with more explanations towards almost anything or just left out completely. This was a real shame, but still manages to not take too much away from the action and story progression. One example of this is Harlock’s closest companion, the alien Miime. We are shown in one episode of Miime’s total backstory that tries to explain everything. It feels rushed and you want more. This is how the anime works. You will get answers, but they are extremely simplistic and are never touched on again.\\nThe artwork, writing, story, and more are very similar to Yamato with some improvement, but there is no problem there and to be expected in Matsumoto’s work. Be prepared. This show has multiple side stories, a sequel that came out 20 years later, and a 2013 movie. This is a slower paced 42 episode anime. There are the occasional deep-gripping moments which were a real surprise, and had me fall in love with the show more.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'The seemingly endless afternoon I spent reading an Anime encyclopedia a few months ago did not only provide me with more insight on glorified child pornography than I would have ever imagined: it also displayed a mysterious picture of a woman under the title \"Queen Emeraldas.\" Somehow fascinated by a few passages describing the Leijiverse, I spent some time researching Leiji Matsumoto on the internet and eventually ended up seeing Captain Harlock. I approached this, by comparison to most other anime, antiquity with high expectations. It turned out to differ quite fundamentally from my personal vision of warfare and human drama, but by no means\\ndid it disappoint me. In this review I explain why.\\nStory: 8/10\\nAfter a quick narration that  introduces earth, which has developed for 900 years from our time into a state of apathy and corruption, the story initiates with a form of episodic nature. The protagonist captain Harlock finds himself in trouble every time he visits Mayu, the daughter of one of his past comrades. As he is an outlaw, the prime minister on earth is determined to use Mayu in order to trap the infamous space pirate, but fails each time. Meanwhile we\\'re introduced to other characters who eventually come to complement the crew on Arcadia; Harlock\\'s space ship.\\nThe story takes its time to pick up, but by the time you grow attached to the characters and the real point of the narration reveals itself, watching the show turns into an addiction. As an extraterrestrial race attempts to invade earth, Harlock and his crew sets out to protect the very planet they\\'ve abandoned. Known as the Mazone, their enemies engage in psychological and biological warfare in the name of their beloved but merciless queen Rafflesia. Turbulent space battles are combined with a profound sense of melancholia in an epic adventure that reaches admirable heights of quality. It relies more heavily on characterization than plot progression, but with plenty of twists up its sleeve, the story of Captain Harlock quickly leaves behind its initially boring episodes and blasts off towards awesomeness.\\nAnimation: 5/10\\nThough not below standard for its time, Captain Harlock is still unable to reach equal heights of splendor when it comes to animation that contemporary contestants like Rose of Versailles and Mobile Suit Gundam did. Movement tends to be awkward and the numbers of mistakes you find throughout the series are far too many to list. Admittedly though, the character designs of Leiji Matsumoto are what make the show stand out. Minor characters are usually subdued to a state of cartoonism but Harlock and other various noble characters we meet later on are somewhat detailed and well made. Women tend to have long beautiful hair and slender bodies and overall there\\'s something unique over the proportions and the eyes of the characters that the otherwise poor animation benefits heavily from.\\nUnfortunately, the space battles are unable to reach compelling levels as the animation does not allow that to happen. This is not a particularly big loss as the primary focus on the show lies within the characters and dialogue. It might put some people off though.\\nSound: 7/10\\nThe soundtrack is equipped with a large variety of instruments and several songs designed specifically to fit the content of the story. As such, the opening theme is a direct reference to Harlock\\'s dedication to protect earth despite its corrupted state.\\nA usual occurrence is that the characters themselves grab an instrument to play in a sudden state of melancholia. Whether it\\'s Mayu playing on her ocarina or the mysterious extraterrestrial female Miime diligently using her harp, it\\'s an interesting thing to see such a large portion of the soundtrack comprised of their melodies. Another memorable scene is when Harlock and his crew (SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILER) face to face. Mysterious voices that reminded me of Suspiria dominated the soundtrack at that moment and truly emphasized what mysterious creatures the Mazone are.\\nVoice acting deserves some praise as well, in particular that of Captain Harlock.\\nCharacters: 8/10\\nI realized it sooner than I thought, but during the 42 episodes I fell in love with the characters. Somewhat detailed characterization is a very big priority in the show, and most of the crewmembers aboard the Arcadia get their moments under the spotlight in the form of monologues or flashbacks. United by their inability to find their places in life on earth, as well as their common enemy, they all have harrowing stories of sorrow and agony to tell. Perhaps most memorable among the crewmembers is the mysterious and melancholic Miime. As the sole survivor of her kind she suffers from a grand feeling of alienation and loneliness. She swears to follow the man who saved her (Harlock) whether he chooses to roam the sea of space throughout the remainder of his life or venture deep into the pits of hell.\\nEven amongst the vicious Mazone there are several interesting characters to follow; Queen Rafflesia being the most prominent one. Bewildered over Harlock\\'s dedication to protect the very earth he despises she tries hard to understand her enemy. We also get to witness her initially prideful and strong persona undergo a gruesome metamorphosis to the point of desperation and cruelty. The one thing that\\'s for sure though is that Leiji Matsumoto remains somewhat neutral in his depiction of humans and the Mazone. He makes sure to emphasize both virtues and corruption on both opposing sides, and even though the Mazone in general are depicted as malicious, their actions and feelings succeed at generating sympathy.\\nOverall: 8/10\\nIt only hints the grandeur within the Leijiverse, but Captain Harlock is a rewarding experience not only because of the excellent and loveable characters, but also thanks to its well applied soundtrack and narration. It also introduces a character whom I know little of, but who I find absolutely fascinating, a woman named Emeraldas who seems to be a female equivalent of Harlock. There\\'s still a long way to go but I plan to continue exploring the Leijiverse, and hopefully I\\'ll have the time and energy to review other titles as well.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '16301974016dd0307a419686011e1ab'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'So for starters and clarity , I am both a fan & long time appreciator of Mr Matsumoto\\'s work .\\nNow with that said I will be taking a mostly unbiased stance on this series and try to cover how it holds up by modern day standards and critique .\\nStory ~ 8/10\\nThe base plot and narrative of Captain Herlock is akin to that of a classic spaghetti western.\\nfilled to the brim with a rogues gallery of corrupt lawmen , deceptive military forces , villains from other galaxies and a society of downtrodden civilians looking for a savior up above .\\nAnd that savior comes in\\nthe form of a scarred and brooding space pirate who wants nothing more then to free earth from its plague of laziness and societal shackles that have weighed it down for far too long , all while a mysterious alien entity plans on a decisive and humanity destroying take over.\\n~~ And while all these aspects encapsulate the core and driving narrative of the series you can expect a fairly episodic drama in the vain of classic American westerns like Gunsmoke or Rawhide wrapped in a thick and shiny layer of Syfy pseudoscience and shanty time theatrics with the main plot often times taking a back seat to small 1 to 2 episode mini adventures. Think Cowboy bebop with more 50s style drama  and theatrical flair in place of the 60s style jazzy coolness and frantic pacing.\\nArt ~ 8/10\\nThe art direction for the show is at its peak shown in the astounding and breathtaking views of the future in the same imaginative breath as Rintaro\\'s masterpiece adaptation of \"Metropolis\"  mixed with a loving splash of Jean Giraud esque dreamscapes of space and far away planets , all being held together with the wonderfully bleak and looming designs of its gigantic battleship influenced Space crafts and towering obelisk like Japanese metropolitan earth setting , ~ and at its weakest you will be left with no less then the syfy standard black and white speckled space views and dreary metal corridors that blend into one another.\\nAnimation ~ 5/10 , modern standard , 7/10 for the time of its creation\\nThe animation for this series is its weakest point , not for being bad for the time of its creation\\nbut because these limited budget late 70s animation productions simply don\\'t hold up well in today\\'s age. With most scenes looking more like a series of key frames with no in betweens in sight. but if your accustomed to watching this era of animation then you\\'ll know its pacing well , and if you want to give an early series like this a try then I say try and focus on the plot and pretty character designs while you ease into its often jarring and stiff flow and movement .\\nSound ~ 8/10\\nVery much one of the strong points of this series is its wonderfully fitting and on point soundtrack. Its made up of 40% Pirate shanty music done in an operatic fashion and 60% 70s style Enka jazz with love ballad style vocal accompaniment , Picture a Lupin III Yuji Ohno soundtrack with less funk but 3x more orchestral jazz . And as for the sound effects they are your standard \"Zaps\" \"Pews\" and \"Booms\" of any old fashion syfy anime , extremely cheesy in the most endearing of ways .\\nCharacters ~ 6/10\\nI feel the characters have taken a bit of a beating by modern day critique standards\\nwhile they hold up well for their time of creation and even were quite ground breaking back then\\nthey sadly are by today\\'s standard incredibly trope heavy two dimensional characters who really exist to fit their needed roll and plot device. Now with that said they fit their role in a heart felt and loving way you can\\'t help but enjoy it in the realm of the story itself , but when looked at on their own merit they stand quite short of true greatness  , Captain Herlock was given the kind blessing of being brought back and made a reappearing character in Leiji\\'s world and in doing so gets his much needed character development else where but sadly not as much as one would have hoped from his own granted series .\\nEnjoyment ~ 9/10\\nEven with the many short comings that come with a vintage space opera Like Captain Herlock\\nas long as you come in with an open mind and are looking to see a truly grand show of drama , love and adventure then I think most anybody can get a great deal of joy out of captain Herlock and his crew of misfit space pirates ~  tho I highly recommend pacing ones self with a few episodes at a time , cuz the cheese and drama will wear on ones nerves quick ~\\nall in all I give the show a rare but worthy ~ 8/10\\nIf their are but two or three series that needed to be cherry picked from the 70s to represent  the era and influence they had on anime and manga characters and writing to this day then\\nCaptain Herlock is undeniably one of the few that will forever go down in Japanese animation history as a legendary work of pure genius and amazement .', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8e51765d3f01546d44327169130404ac'}>,\n",

Schlocky, sure, but every episode, hell, the entire show, is unpredictable.\\nThat fact lends itself from the character of the enigmatic titular character, Harlock, who is the crux of this entire journey from beginning to end. We never know truly who he is, why he’s willing to die for people who hate him, why he fights with all his show. We eventually see peeks into that shell of his, but even at the end of the show, the dude is still as unreadable as he is badass.\\nOf course, the side characters were also really great too, albeit not being too fleshed out (though you could blame this on the short runtime of the show).\\nMost interestingly tho, what impressed me most about the writing was just...the vibe I got, going from episode to episode.\\nThere’s an air of maturity to these characters that I can’t really put a finger on. Most member of the crew feels like an actual adult onstead of a walking bundle of tropes. Everyone in the series has a past with regrets, all of them have pain that they’ve experienced, but no matter what it is, they all move forward and fight forward for the sake of their freedom, and freedom of others.\\nDeath happens, sadness takes over for a bit, but they move on. They remember, internalize the loss, but they don’t dwell on it, and rarely even seek revenge.\\nWhen there’s a choice to be made between a personal love and “the greater good” it’s usually always the personal choice, because your own good IS the greater good.\\nI know it was just a kid’s show, but it’s such a refreshing thing to see characters like this when nowadays, all these shonens have characters that are just so...I don’t know man, vapid?\\nAlways about friendship triumphing, always about how war is bad and killing is evil, always about trying to gain something that was lost in the past, blahblah.\\nAgain, I can’t put my finger on it, but it’s just different and really mature, something I never expected from a show about a space pirate fighting screaming plant girls.\\nIn thhe end, I got way more out of Harlock than I ever could have expected, and I can totally see why it’s regarded as one of the best anime ever made.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'dad34d7616e4721e02d2b76c5b353971'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Herlock. An interesting take on the space opera genre combing elements of Uchuu Senkan Yamato (both of these are by the same Leiji Matsumoto) and the traditional western pirate. The story is set with a united Earth government and Space Pirate Herlock being an outlaw forced to live out his days in space, but he doesn\\'t let this stop him from making many trips back home...\\nStory~8\\nThe story was very good. Essentially, an alien race calling themselves the Mazone have lost their home planet and set their eyes on the Earth for refuge. Without giving too much away, interestingly, this is already a\\nsecond home for the Mazone. The strategies of Herlock and his crew show great story planning by the directors and will draw the audience in. The downfalls of the story was its overall pace, since it took a few episodes to get started. This was mainly things dealing with on Earth, rather than the usual character-crew exposé which occurs later. Herlock, being a notorious space pirate is on his own with no help from the Earth, which makes the anime all the more interesting to see how this one ship deals with an entire race of alien beings.\\nArt~9\\nThe art is amazing for it\\'s age. Excellent use of colors and their various palettes. Remember the anime occurs in space where their are many different environments for the artists to conjure up. This opens up many doors for the production team to experiment with many art styles without making the anime look too overdone. What\\'s more is that the anime is consistent with its animation style for better immersion. The art is really one of the strong points of the series and the finished product gave me an appreciation for older anime and reminded me I was making a smart move by not passing it up because of its age.\\nSound~8\\nVery good and memorable themes for the music aspect. Very catchy too :] The seiyuu\\'s really matched their characters well which helped in the immersion process. There are elements of standard space battle sounds which make certain weapons or sounds in general more recognizable. The anime just sounded great. Suspense scenes, action scenes, comical scenes, sad scenes, happy scenes; it is very easy to believe what the animators were trying to portray since the sound backed them up so much.\\nCharacter~6\\nThis is a very controversial and very critical aspect of the show. Basically, many of the characters from this anime are just rips from Uchuu Senkan Yamato. Both have a drunken doctor with a pet cat, both have similar looking younger \"hotheads\", both have almost identical blonde captain\\'s assistants, the main enemies for Yamato are a blue race of primarily men while Herlock\\'s enemies are a blue race of primarily women; the anime was obviously inspired by Yamato, but this is where the similarities end. Leiji Matsumoto, the creator of both of these franchises, uses very similar artwork and designs for all of his works, even including Ginga Tetsudo 999 and all the cross-overs between these characters (can we even call it a rip off if they are by the exact same person?) Many of the characters have their own backstories explaining why they are pirates which makes their character seem more authentic in a way since they are not just fighting for the sake of fighting. Character motives are very different, given the lively crew a new dimension of likability, as the stoic Herlock has to deal with various mishaps aboard his ship.\\nEnjoyment-9\\nIf we get past the lackadaisical character design and let them by as mere \"stock character options\" for the naysayers and \"Matsumoto\\'s specific style\" for the yay-sayers, the anime is really enjoyable throwing it\\'s audience into a world where the pirates are the ones who have the Earth\\'s best interest in mind fighting dangerous battles and defending the land. A lot can get done in 42 episodes and I enjoyed this series as a unique space opera option. Again, I would have preferred if the beginning was a bit faster but once an episode started, I would be surprised at how fast it seemed to finish. Herlock showcases the importance of being calm and collected in the midst of any situation, since it helps him think clearly and his actions are very easy to understand and relate to.\\nOverall-8\\nThis anime is very good. It draws you in and let\\'s you form attachments to the various characters since they are each very different from one another. The animation was very good for its time, and the story was superb. The production staff really presented a well written anime Herlock fit\\'s the profile of the quiet but very intelligent MC\\'s which is always a fan favorite in many series. It\\'s easy to imagine yourself apart of Herlock\\'s crew sailing away on the vast expanses of the universe. It\\'s worth at least checking out for a classic 70\\'s space-age drama.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Working!! is an example of an anime that’s been done countless times before and will be again.  Admittedly I was expecting this but was attracted to the series cute looking characters and the slice of life pacing.  While the series gets off to a slow start things did manage to improve greatly only to end in the dustbin of history thanks to the douchebaggery of its  narcissistic cast of asshats.\\nThe premise of Working!! puts us into the inner workings of a family restaurant.  The employees run the gambit of strangeness and mental issues to setup all the outstanding and original comedy\\nthat awaits us.  That’s sarcasm by the way.  At the start of the show the restaurant is shorthanded and the search for a new part timer to help out ends with our typical over burdened high schooler, this time named Souta Takanashi.  Apparently the financial distress of Japanese families is quite high and even though he lives in a modest house with three working age sisters and an alleged mother (I am assuming she existed, they said she did kind of like my Papa told me Santa Claus lived in the North Pole when I was five...) that they must put their high school younger brother to work to make ends meet.  It’s such a romantic setting that can only occur in Asia apparently.  The bastion of child labor and exploitation... oh wait I was talking about our lovely heartfelt slave err labor anime!\\nFrom the very beginning the show is decidedly unimpressive.  The cast comes off completely stereotypical and clichéd from the start.  Every character type is represented there has ever been there, in all their glory.  Now this isn’t exactly new ground here, we see this in practically everything and at this point there basically are no original characters anymore.  But these characters for the most part come off as bland copies, devoid of personality and psychotic misfits I would sooner see hauled off by a van with padded walls driven by guys in lab coats.\\nHowever, this starts to change and by mid series things start to actually get pretty fun and amusing.  Characters which are annoying take a back seat and others which initially were the worst actually develop into pretty solid and interesting personalities.  I found it unusual that I could have such a completely different opinion of certain characters in such few episodes from the beginning to the end of the series.\\nThings really fall apart though in the last episode.  I was well on my way to having an average to above average experience with this anime until once again the characters that made watching this show such a pain in the beginning, bring it down into the sewer.  I always find it strange how people who claim to all be \"friends\" in some of these shows can do the things they do to each other, even in fun and for their own selfish amusement.  There are some lines that just can’t be crossed however and over the years I have found I have grown tired of humiliation and deviant behavior being used for laughs.\\nThe cast is ripe with love and hate characters.  On the positive side is our lead, Takanashi.  At first I found him to be an initial source of annoyance as he looked to be your typical lolicon.  Thankfully this wasn’t the case and he manages to develop into a pretty nice leading man and one whom the viewer can relate and root for.  He is a bit strange in his own right, which is love of cute things but this is mostly harmless and for the most part is the only voice of reason and sanity.\\nNext to him would be another character who I thought would be irritating, Inami, who contrary to what the viewer might think from the start is actually the lead heroine.  She suffers from a fear of men which makes her want to punch any man she sees.  This of course causes a lot of problems in a working environment populated by both men and women and results in quite a few punches to the face of our unfortunate leading man.  Despite this, as the reasons for her fears is revealed and her struggles with conquering them makes her ultimately a very interesting and satisfying character.\\nThe bad would be pretty much everyone else.  Characters initially amusing like the cute and adorable Taneshima become narcissistic perverts and contribute to my eventual disdain for this title.  Others are just completely boring and unamusing.  This would include characters such as the one dimensional restaurant manager, head waitress, and kitchen staff as well as Takanashi\\'s useless sisters.  While there are a few laughs with them along the way, they’re totally devoid of likability.  Their contribution, through their selfish behavior, to ruining what should have been a touching final episode and the culmination of the series makes me despise them even more.\\nOne of the real positives though is what initially attracted me to Working!!  The artwork is really good.  Despite my negative feelings for many of the characters, their designs were very good.  I thought the humor was expressed very effectively through the animation when it was actually funny.  The OP animation was also really cute and charming, even though the music itself was a bit ordinary.  Vocally the acting is pretty average all around with nothing exceptionally bad or good.\\nOverall, Working!! is just too uneven an experience to be considered even average.  Was I too harsh with this?  Perhaps, but at this point I feel I have grown tired of certain anime fetishes.  Incest, psychologic trauma from horribly inexcusable parenting, and cross-dressing are just a few.  While there is nothing incestuous in this the other two are on display proudly.  Is Working!! worth watching?  I think that depends.  If you’re a relatively new or inexperienced anime viewer this will likely be amusing to you and the things that stand out as clichéd won’t seem so much so.  Anyone else should give it a pass, I sure wish I had.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd871aeec8eda908965902114b9b67fc4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Uninspiring and rather dull.\\nWorking!! (please note the two exclamation marks) is a slice of life, comedy show about people who work at a family restaurant, you know, one of those restaurants that serve mediocre food. It is only befitting that this show is as bad as the food presumably served at the mediocre restaurant.\\nWith no plot whatsoever this anime is as episodic as it can possibly be, yet it's not. It's not episodic because in an episodic anime there would be a plot outline for each episode, or for the episodes included in an arc. In Working!! there exist no plot whatsoever. I honestly believed\\nthat the male phobia thing that one of the female protagonists suffer from was a gimmick, a passing feature used for some comic relief in an otherwise rather un-comical show. I was mistaken. It's the main focal point of many of the events that take place in many of the episodes in this anime and it's just..., uninspiring.\\nA few points of interest were to be found though, the supporting character Yamada is the most entertaining character in the show and there is no competition. Most characters were dull and the producers really tried to make them more interesting with some eccentric appealing attributes, it didn't work though. I understand that this anime was supposed to be a bit parodical, a bit sarcastic, a bit funny, but the problem is; it's not. Somewhere along the way of production they got a serious case of carebear flu and decided to take the production seriously.\\nHalfassed, fake and poor screenplay for the most part with no plot summarizes this stellar production from A-1 Pictures Inc.\\nHaters gonna hate.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd04943e933faa9a80cb370b957503a0a'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Working!, a popular anime adapted from a 4koma which is riding on the \"moe\" wave was one of the better shows of the Spring 2010 season.\\nWe start off the story with a young man named Souta Takanashi or more commonly known as Shinra or Lelouch. This young man is looking for a job to support his dysfunctional family filled with eccentric women. He is forced to help put food on the table for his underprivileged family and begins working a restaurant called the Wagnaria (Denny\\'s) and meets a large array of hilarious characters. Takanashi needs to support his family because of the troubles at home.\\nHis mother works long hours and his father is dead yet due to his mother being an office lady she doesn\\'t make enough to feed the family. Takanashi must take care of his 4 eccentric sisters by working at the restaurant. His oldest sister, Kazue, despite being a lawyer and in her 30\\'s lives at home after going through a divorce and losing custody of her kids because she got home late and beat them. It\\'s a miracle that she still can practice law and beat her kids but that\\'s Japan\\'s problem. Takanashi also needs to support his depressed siste, Izumi, who\\'s liable to kill herself at any given moment and is too depressed to walk. Despite being nearly 30 she still lives at home and complains about the colorful world and keeps to her dark room. (If I could pick a girl from the show to be my wife, I\\'d take her..she\\'d fit my dark and brooding vampiric lifestyle perfectly). On top of that he has to take care of his drunken sister, Kozue, who despite somehow holding down a job spends all of her money on liquor and abortions for all the times she has unprotected sex with various men. To top it all off Takanashi\\'s youngest sister Nazuna is manipulative and a dominatrix despite being in elementary school. As you can see Takanashi\\'s family circumstances are very dark and upsetting which is the undertone for this series. I personally found the darkness and depth of this show to be excellent since I am a dark person myself and I like to sit in a dark corner at Starbucks and drink black coffee.\\nWhile at work Takanashi\\'s life is just as hard. He has to deal with a group of mentally unstable and eccentric people that are most likely on drugs (it\\'s just like Denny\\'s here in the US, the one by me was shut down because they were cooking meth in the basement). Takanashi is repeatedly beaten and abused by Mahiru Inami, a self proclaimed \"androphobe\" but in reality is just tweaking from her lack of meth at work. He also has to deal with the two strongest men in Ikebukuro, Satou and Souma who happen to the cooks. They do nothing but troll him and make fun of him and offer little consideration for Takanashi\\'s home issues. He also has to work with a mentally challenged yet well endowed short girl named Poplar who can\\'t do anything right yet somehow still has a job and a Zange clone who\\'s also mentally challenged named Yamada. To top it off there\\'s the two lesbian crew leaders named Kyouko and Yachiyo who service each other throughout the day. As you can see Takanashi\\'s working life is not much better than his home life and the eccentric and most likely drugged up people he works with don\\'t help his situation.\\nThe character depth and story of this show is very good and it gives off a very dark and deep theme. I like that in a show and I like to watch Takanashi suffer in his daily struggles that are shown in the show and to watch my 2d wife (waifu) Izumi. I give the story and characters an 8/10 because they were dark and depressing. However, there was too much fun in the series and it could have been better if there was more dramatic moments and if there were some tragedies.\\nThe sound and art was good so I give them a 9/10..they could have been drawn in a much darker setting but every Denny\\'s I\\'ve been to is very bright to show off the cockroaches anyways.\\nOverall I rate this show an 8/10..I really enjoyed the characters and their back stories and I really liked how the show related to a dark and foreboding creature like myself. I would definitely watch this on my windows powered laptop at Starbucks and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a dark and depressing show mixed with some comedy for extra enjoyment. I feel this show is the highlight of the spring season and I like the direction Japan is going with these depressing, vampire orientated shows as of late. However, this show was not without flaws..there could have been some gore added to it like with Satou and Souma in the kitchen having accidents and Poplar accidentally impaling herself on a broken glass shard. A little blood in a dark show like this goes a long way and I feel that it needed some sanguine goodness to be a 10/10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8653e892354b2bfd3f9a01c652903c33'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"It's sad how something that started out looking so promising became watching endless eight with slight variations to each episode.\\nWhat happens in every episode is as follows:\\nTakanashi likes something cute, like Taneshima, and goes into trance mode upon seeing it.\\nInami resists punching guys, but punches Takanashi anyway.\\nTaneshima mispronounces Takanashi.\\nKyouko sits there waiting for Yachiyo to serve her.\\nYachiyo goes gaga over Kyouko, and complains to Satou, who has romantic feelings for Yachyo, and thus gets jealous.\\nYachiyo draws her katana and threatens to cut anything that gets in the way of her and Kyouko.\\nSouma gets dirt on everyone and blackmails them to do his work.\\nThere are\\nother factors that might be added in, like the addition of Takanashi's family, the long lost manager of the restaurant that went out looking for his wife, and, more recently, the addition of a runaway who tries to get her perfect family.\\nNow, I am a great fan of episodic anime. Just take a look at my favourite list (Aria, Hidamari Sketch, Lucky Star). The major problem is that, without a plot, what needs to be done is to create likable characters and situations that one can really enjoy. I initially liked what they did with Inami, that her man-phobia is affecting the entire restaurant, but there comes a time when a situation gets overused. Yachiyo started as my 2nd favourite character, behind Inami, but, as above, she does nothing different every episode.No one likes to see an overused plot element. It's boring, repetitive, and it makes even 24 minutes weekly a drag to watch.\\nThat said, which other characters are actually likable? Taneshima was supposed to be the lead female, but, obviously, she has been pushed aside by Inami. So, what does Taneshima actually add to the story? She is the most boring lead I have ever seen. Usually with leads, you either like them or hate them. Taneshima does next to nothing each episode, so people can't actually decide if they like her or not. Same goes to the non-main males in the series. For example, the only thing we know about Souma is his blackmailing intent. How interesting does that make a person? We only know ONE thing about him. There is absolutely no character development.\\nSound wise, I skip though the opening every week. I mean, seriously, that opening is even more annoying than K-ON!!'s (the 2nd season, btw). Nothing special in terms of voice acting, and art is pretty dull for a 2010 anime.\\nGranted, Working!! does have its entertaining moments, but unless you really have nothing better to do, or watch it in fast forward like I do, my advice is not to watch it. There are plenty of better episodic comedy/slice of life anime out there. Repetitive attempts at humour really makes this a poor anime.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e0f68c31ca21893d5e1e55a795ae1320'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Looking at what I should expect for the Spring 2010 anime season through a calendar released by a source I don\\'t know, one particular show had caught my interest.  The little plot summary read, \"The story is set in a family restaurant named \"Wagnaria\", in the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido.  Sota works part-time there among the restaurant\\'s high-spirited and strange staff.\"  Reading that and looking at the picture of that anime had made me want to watch it.  After watching that first episode, I knew that I\\'d enjoy Working!!\\nStory:  After reading that little plot synopsis, you would think that\\nthere\\'s an interesting story behind Working!!  Unfortunately, there isn\\'t, but that\\'s what made Working!! enjoyable since it IS a Slice of Life anime.  The story kicks off with our adorable busty loli, Poplar Taneshima, greeting some customers on a normal work day.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is a bit short-staffed, so it\\'s up to Poplar to gather some new recruits since the manager, Kyouko Shirafuji, is as lazy as a sloth.  After asking many people to see if they would like a part-time job, but only to get that offer rejected, she suddenly bumps into our main protagonist, Souta Takanashi.  Though he thinks Poplar is a small child and is lost, Poplar retorts saying she\\'s 17 years old and is looking for part-timers for her job.  Knowing that he\\'ll work with Poplar since he believes she\\'s cute, Takanashi gladly accepts.  From there on, Takanashi\\'s life has became a bit more crazier now that he\\'s working at Wagnaria.\\nArt:  The art is nothing too extraordinary.  Colorful and sharp, the art is nice to look at.  Looking back, it feels like art you would expect from a Comedy and Slice of Life anime.\\nSound:  About everyone who\\'s watched Working!! will always know the first few lines of the opening by heart.  It is honestly one of the most catchy and probably addicting openings I\\'ve heard.  The ending sounds great as well.  The voice actors do a terrific job in playing their character.  The male VAs, to me, felt it was like an ensemble cast.  With Jun Fukuyama (DRRR!!, Geass), Daisuke Ono (DRRR!!, TMoHS), and Hiroshi Kamiya (DRRR!!, SZS) as Takanashi, Satou, and Souma respectively.\\nCharacters:  The characters, to me, were the main enjoyment of the show.  Like what the little plot synopsis said in the beginning of this review, \"...high-spirited and strange staff.\", strange is the key word.\\nFirst off, Takanashi may look like a normal person, but the truth is that he loves small and cute things, ranging from little children, animals, and toys, which is pretty much why he started working due to Poplar being small and cute.  When he revealed this information to Satou and Kyouko, they thought that he was a lolicon which Takanashi strictly objects.\\nNext we have the highly eccentric and adorable Poplar.  Again, you would think she\\'s normal, but it\\'s revealed that she has a very strong desire of becoming taller.  Because of her small height, she is easily mistaken as an elementary or middle school student, thus making her very sensitive whenever her height is discussed.\\nOne of the strangest characters in Working!! is the timid Mahiru Inami.  Inami is introduced as an androphobic (fear of male) girl.  Whenever a male approaches her, she punches them without hesitation due to a belief that every man is ready to attack her.  Though she has this condition, she is still able to work at Wagnaria, but only serving the female customers.\\nKyouko and Yachiyo Todoroki are what I consider the yuri couple of the show.  Kyouko, as we know, is the lazy manager of Wagnaria, who does nothing but eat, usually the parfaits that Yachiyo brings her.  Yachiyo herself is strange overall.  She is always, and I mean ALWAYS carries with her a katana, which many are intimidated by that.  She also has a deep connection with Kyouko.  If Kyouko is away or is taken away from her, she gets sad and angry to a point where she would kill the person who took her away from her with her katana.\\nNext up are the chefs of Wagnaria, Jun Satou and Hiroomi Souma.  Satou is probably the more sane one out of the main cast.  He\\'s known as an intimidating, yet helpful individual.  However, he is in love with Yachiyo, but does not show it.  He also enjoys teasing Poplar, usually concerning her height or messing with her hair.  Though he may look always cheerful, deep down, Souma is the most deceiving of the cast.  He enjoys teasing some of the staff, with the exception of Inami, and somehow always gets his hand on some sort of information that is secretive to some of the staff.  Ironically, both characters remind me of Shizuo and Izaya of Durarara!!  Both are voiced by the same actor and both almost have identical personalities, with Satou and Shizuo being intimidating and having blonde hair, and Souma and Izaya being very deceitful and are always able to get their hand on some information.\\nLastly, we have Aoi Yamada.  Though she\\'s introduced late in the series, she appears regularly throughout the show.  She\\'s usually unhelpful and clumsy when it comes to work, but very curious as to what happens in and out her workstation.  She also has a strong desire of having the ideal family.\\nEnjoyment:  From beginning to end, I enjoyed Working!!  Whether it be Takanashi \"trying\" to cure Inami\\'s androphobia, the strange diversity that occurs in the Takanashi household, or the usual, but sometimes, strange happenings inside Wagnaria, there\\'s always something to enjoy when watching this anime.\\nScores-\\nStory- 7\\nArt- 8\\nSound- 8\\nCharacter- 10\\nEnjoyment- 10\\nOverall:  I really enjoyed watching Working!!  It was an unexpected hit for me for the spring season.  The opening just sucks me in and prepares me for something that I\\'ll enjoy from beginning to end.  With just only 13 episodes, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn\\'t longer since I found it to have a lot of potential, but nonetheless, those 13 episodes were great to watch.  If you\\'re considering watching Working!!, be in mind that it IS slice of life, meaning that it has almost no plot, and if you\\'re one to watch for plot or just don\\'t like slice of life, then Working!! isn\\'t for you.  For those that enjoy slice of life, Working!! is definitely worth looking into.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '38b724a532a63481e86e7c70f5146435'}>,\n",

But it's a funny show, so I thought I'd give it a try.\\nBasically, the only relatively normal characters in the story are Takanashi and Sato, and the other blue-haired guy who's name escapes me. Takanashi is actually very funny to watch, his reactions to the other employees (Such his fear of Yachiyo and his annoyance towards Inami and her brutal ways)  is most of the comedy anyway. Taneshima is cute and bubbly and really does remind you of a middle-schooler, which\\nis sad considering she's 17. Yachiyo seems like a bit of an air-head but it's semi-tolerable, but then again it's part of the wackyness of the show. The only character that really annoys me is Inami.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"'Working!!' is flawed. If I had to guess, a lot of people will lose interest and move on after trying a few episodes. This is because your enjoyment of 'Working!!' will almost entirely depend on whether you enjoy seeing its various characters interact. In fact, I'm very glad that the opening song is so damn addictive - because that's the reason I stuck with the show long enough for it to actually begin growing on me.\\nFor better or worse, 'Working!!' introduces its characters slowly and gradually. Better, because getting to know these people feels very organic and natural, and worse, because in the beginning,\\nyou don't know anyone and many of the characters (especially at first sight) seem like stereotypical archetypes, and will come across as cliched - even annoying. For example, Popura seems like your generic busty loli. Satou seems like the usual scary-eyed dude with a golden heart.\\nAnd Inami - oh Inami. She's genuinely annoying and even frustrating to watch. At least, until you get to know more about her character. Her 'condition' is often used as a joke, and initially seems to be nothing more than a cheap way to include slapstick in the show. But later on, this begins to actually influence the plot. And that's when her condition, and Inami herself, get interesting. Something similar happens to all the characters - to some extent, at least.\\nThe thing is, the show is slice of life; and because of that, you only learn about the people when some event happens and you're around to see it. They don't just open their mouths and let their life stories pour out on you. There's a constant sense of discovering new things about the various people. The problem is, I get the feeling only some viewers will reach that point.\\nTime for some specifics:\\nSTORY: 6\\nThe show is slice of life, so it doesn't have much of a story to speak of. People work at a restaurant, and stuff happens. You may or may not care.\\nART: 7\\nThe visuals are appropriate; the art is crisp and colorful, and easy on the eyes.  They don't do anything to wow you, but there's also no need to. The art isn't the star here, and for what it's worth, it does what it needs to do.\\nSOUND: 8\\nThe opening song is audio-crack. I'm not usually a fan of such energetic and cutesy songs, but this particular one's so damn charming that I immediately became hooked. The voice acting is great and hits all the right notes, and all of the characters sound spot-on. The BGM isn't too memorable, mainly because the story isn't very dramatic. Although, at one point, it did sound completely appropriate (near the end of episode 9).\\nCHARACTER: 8\\nThis one's highly subjective. If I'd written this about a month ago, I would have scored this much lower. At least for me, the characters grew on me over the episodes, and rather well. I actually began to enjoy watching Popura, even though I hate most characters in other shows that look and sound even remotely like her.\\nENJOYMENT: 7\\nAlso highly subjective. I tried to balance the fact that not everybody will enjoy this show. If the characters hit the right notes in you, you'll laugh with them. If not, you'll scoff at their futile attempts at making you care. Another factor is whether you enjoy slice of life in general. If not, you'll probably be bored rather quickly.\\nOVERALL: 7\\nIn the end, the later episodes of 'Working!!' are much, much more enjoyable than the earlier ones, because of the simple fact that you feel like you know about these people - and when stuff happens to them, you actually give a crap. The jokes get funnier, the events have more significance, and the interaction between characters is no longer boring and meaningless. But again - that's only if the people grow on you.

You almost definitely will hate the show.p It's the main source of\\ncomedy in the show, and you will see it repeat over, and over, and over....\\nSo Working!! is really a hit or miss; try at least 2 episodes (3 is better) if it sounds promising.\\nNow on to the actual review:\\nSo, we're at the family restaurant Wagnaria, where most of the early story will take place. It's overall a fairly good story. It's not really what you watch the show, and very little happens over the course of the show, but it still is, in the end, a fairly good story..\\nSo, what is the story? Well basically, it's just developments between all of the character (with very little else changing)so again, stay away if you end up not liking them. We see, as we get to know all of the character, different sides of them, and we see these sides interacting, pushing their relationships forward.This show is not about conquering the world, or even a city; it's a simple interaction between some... interesting character, as we watch their bonds of relationships (not all romantic) bloom.\\nAs you can see, the real strength of this show lies in the characters. We get to see very many different characters, and we learn about them as the show moves along. In this regard, the show is outstanding: we get to see a lot of characters, whose types are often quite original, interact in very believable ways. While I won't say all of the characters are miraculous creations, they all really bring something special to the show and are able to complete its full comedic scene.\\nThe characters were all also played very well: their voices matched up perfectly with the emotions that you would think that they would feel in any situation. This was another great aspect of the show: all of the voice actors were able to capture the complex emotions that some of the characters would have been feeling for moments, and then were again able to change back instantaneously, as if they were actually in the scenes themselves. The sound effects weren't quite as good, but we do still occasionally here a shattering plate, running water, or the expected chorus of murmurs that would fill a restaurant.\\nIf we combine these aspects of the sound with what I think is one of the best OPs of all time, and an ending amazing in its own regard (though not as good), I think the sound is great.\\nMoving on to the visual part of this audiovisual feast, the art was, well good. There wasn't anything that really set it leaps and bounds apart from other anime, but at the same time, the characters were well drown, and our scenery usually had believable people in a restaurant, acting,  well believably. So, overall, the art wasn't great, but it defiantly was still good and did not detract from the general experience of watching Working!!\\nSpeaking of general experiences , mine was great! I personally thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters, their interactions, and everything about the show. You'll probably be similar to me if you like the first couple of episodes, or like the character types.\\nSo, in summary:\\nif you don't like the characters after the first few episodes, DON'T WATCH THIS. I can't stress this point enough. But at the same time, don't can this show if anything in it sounds at all interesting. There's a huge chance you'll really love this show if you don't get annoyed by the characters. So, give it a try, watch a few episodes, and see if you find the characters interesting: it's a really well done anime, and again, if you like the characters, you'll like the anime.\\nBriefer Summary\\nStory: Good (7)\\nArt: Good (7)\\nSound: Great (9)\\nCharacters: Outstanding (10)\\nEnjoyment: Great (for me) (9)\\nBye Working!!

       "  <Document: {'content': '~ Work it off! ~\\nA relaxing anime that attends to the plights of the working lifestyle, by making light of them...\\nWorking!! is an uplifting, quirky, and goofy documentation of everyday working life. It\\'s a\\ndedicated slice of life anime with no trickery whatsoever, and as such: it embraces a very simple concept.\\nContrary to being escapist, everything about Working!! is refreshingly realistic and down-to-earth. It\\ngoes without saying that \"minimalist-styled\" titles such as Working receive very conflicting responses, as\\nmany fail to/refuse to acknowledge the technical merit within; just because \"there\\'s no story\": which in itself is a common misconception. Therefore, the audience that can appreciate the relatability aspect\\nof this 13 episode series are likely to enjoy, while those craving a more far-fetched form of escapism might want to look elsewhere.\\nIt\\'s questionable why people find such pleasure in watching something as down-to-earth as Working!!, while one of the main pull factors of anime as a medium remains: escapism potential - usually entailing distant worlds and superpowers etc. I\\'d like to think it\\'s because the relatable nature of a show like Working!!, brings about a whole new form of escapism...\\nIn spite of the premise and the entire vision behind the show, Wagnaria is far from an ordinary family restaurant. It\\'s interesting, it\\'s fun, it\\'s entertaining, warming, and cosy: everything that working in the real world ISN\\'T. It\\'s not often that i can say so about \"ordinary life\" documentaries, but Working!! is actually rather innovative in the way in which it brings all of these cosy escapist fantasies to life, to something that the mature majority of us can relate to: working life - which makes evident that the show\\'s target audience is beyond 15 (approximately)\\nWhile catering (get it?) primarily to the relatable experiences of adults, Working!! retains its innocent and goofy charm to awaken the child within. It has extremely heavy ties to the very ordinary working lifestyle most of us are fed up with at present, and so by exposing the entertaining side of such a systematic routine... It not only makes light of the situations that arise at Wagnaria... It makes light of life as a whole, and proudly emanates a carefree vibe that makes the show a great way to wind down. It is therefore essentially:, escapism into an optimistic life perspective...\\nThose who desire to indulge in the sugar-coated viewpoint that Working!! brings forth, are unlikely to demand a gripping plot line, and this is appropriate as it would only contradict the show\\'s uplifting, and enjoyably carefree aura. The premise is therefore as simple as possible: Souta (our male protagonist) begins working at Wagnaria - a friendly family restaurant. Throughout, nothing threatens to dramatically shape this plot-line and so the show is infinitely more invested in the character development, which leads me swiftly on...\\nThe character development is EVERYTHING to a dedicated SoL such as Working!!, and so the consideration in this department scales closely to the show\\'s overall quality. Thankfully, Working!! delivers on this front by introducing us to a wide variety of vastly differing personalities that make Wagnaria the unique place it is...\\nWhile the design of our protagonist: Souta has his amusing quirks, he is the POV character to act as the gateway into the audience\\'s reliability. Therefore he\\'s a relatively blank-slate compared to his co-workers.  Which helps to document the rest of the characters, as he maintains a relatively impartial social standpoint.\\nFrom Souta\\'s viewpoint, we\\'re introduced to a colourful selection of personalities...\\nFrom the androphobic antics of Inami, to the hilariously flawed management personal of Wagnaria. Often such diversity leads to more interesting and unpredictable interactions, and so Working!! gave itself a head start through character design: to make the personalities as individual and interesting as possible. In turn, this gives the whole show an unbeatably natural and yet appropriately intreeging chemistry that makes it an entertaining watch, despite its simplicity. The unique nature of each character comes with a few prominent quirks which make the employees all very charming and likable. This is paramount obviously to Working!!\\'s success, and gives each character an amusingly emphasized and familiar \"presence\" that the viewer can immerse themselves in.\\nWorking!! actually undertones a lot of drama as well such as androphobia and love interests. This furthers the depth of the characters with a more conventional \"backstory\" style, and while it\\'s not ALL fun and games when it comes to these matters... Working!! maintains a balance between substance, casual and comedic interactions, to make it into a happy outlook on working life, while being as unpredictable as possible - in spite of the repetitive nature of employment. It\\'s varied, and therefore a bit chaotic at times, as is representative of real life - another point to serve its relatability aspect...\\nThe presentation is very expressive in terms of comedic visual effects, and the overall standard of the animation is high. In the sound department, we\\'re greeted with a calming and very \"family workplace\" feeling atmospheric score, which accurately conveys the show\\'s carefree atmosphere. To accompany this, an OP and an ED track that really emphasizes the \"fun\" of the character chemistry., and therefore couldn\\'t be more appropriate.\\nDownsides?\\nFrom a critical point of view, i must say that it\\'s obvious how there\\'s no interesting plot line to accompany the show. Furthermore, the art is very generic, which isn\\'t helped by the highly excessive usage of cliche anime comedy visual effects, which become more tiresome than expressive or powerful after a while.\\nWorking!! is undoubtedly a very cheesy setup, but it\\'s an example of pure SoL splender that stays true to its branding. It\\'s highly considered anime on most fronts in my opinion., and I found it to be an entertaining and calming outlook on working life - that really lifts my spirits and removes my stresses - the realistic and yet entertaining character chemistry being the strong suit...\\n~ From far away I can see a small distant utopia ~', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7250e32074e0e58af7eca6a43f9ce030'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Slice of life has to me always, always been a rather interesting genre of anime.  Since life is comprised up of many aspects, the amount of possible interpretations of life for an anime are almost limitless.  Today, i will be reviewing an anime that talks about the high-school part time job, in the most literal title of all time, Working!!\\nStory (7.00/10):  The story of working!! is pretty much how it sounds, working.  Our main protagonist Takanashi Souta is stopped on his way from school by a small little girl named Popura (that's how you spell her name in Romaji, don't try\\nand tell me otherwise), urging him to come to the place where she works and help out there as a part timer.  After some rather simple convincing, our main protagonist does come and work at the family restaurant known as Wagnaria, where he meets a bunch of oddballs.\\nAs a base concrete idea, this story has really no originality.  Throughout all of anime, the idea of a main protagonist meeting a bunch of oddball characters has been explored many times by other anime.  That's not to say the idea is stale and bad, as many shows, like this one, have actually made use of the idea in a beneficial nature, but the fact remains, that the idea is overused and quite common in anime overall.\\nAs far as a plot line, this anime surprisingly has one.  Not a very noticeable one that you notice straight from the beginning, mind you, but a plot line nonetheless.  The anime does this weird sort of set up, where practically the first half of the show is built in an episodic format where the topics and plot points of the show scatter around depending on which episode you're watching, and then ending off in the second half with a cute, but somewhat unnecessary romantic plot line.  While I am a huge fan of romantic subplot and romantic storylines, focusing quite a substantial amount of screentime on it felt a little off, as I felt like I was watching a completely different anime altogether.\\nOverall, I felt like the story of Working!! was enjoyable, even with its slight story flaws and overused base story idea.  Nothing felt rushed into terms of story pacing, and the anime did a great job at exploring the main characters by giving most of them a episode that was practically devoted to them in the first few episodes, which I felt was a very good way at giving the audience a way of knowing who the characters were and what they had that was unique to them.  For an ending, it could be better.  There wasn't really a resolution I felt to the series, and nothing really stood out as extraordinary when the series ended.\\nOverview:\\n+  Introduction episodes for main characters\\n+  Good story pacing\\n-   Bland base plot idea\\n-   No real resolution in the end\\nCharacters (8.33/10):  For most slice of life's, good and memorable characters are usually required to make the show interesting and overall a good show in general.  And Working!!, certainly has that.\\nFor the main cast, we vary from all different ends of the spectrum.  We have the main protagonist obsessed with cute things, Takanashi Souta, Taneshima Popura, who is ironically nicknamed Poplar, given her size, (Poplar trees are quite tall in nature.) and Mahiru Inami, which to me, has a personality who reminds me of Arashiko from MM!  (Basically, she has a fear of men, and instinctively punches them in the face if they get too close.)  As well, as a whole other smorgasbord of characters of whom all have quite interesting and memorable personalities.\\nIn terms of supporting cast, we don't have as large of a cast as other animes, but for what we do get, we get characters who are quite memorable to some extent.  Character's like Souta's family of four sisters, Inami's parents, and some random ones that appear for periods of time.\\nThe show uses its characters well, making its bland plot idea very flavorful and colorful due to the fact that the characters that live in this world are very out there in terms of personalities, and create some great and wonderful funny moments.  The interactions between these characters are very prominent in the series and as such, make the series what it is.\\nThere are however, some downfalls.  The biggest one I see, is the fact that the anime sometimes doesn't do a good job on utilizing its main characters to their fullest capacity.  What I mean by this, is the fact that they don't use all of their main characters as well as they could.  Towards the end, the story rather than focusing on all 8 of the main characters as they had done previously, only really focused on 2 characters, making everyone else feel somewhat obsolete and pushed into the supporting character roles.  To say that they didn't get any proper screen time is an overstatement, but I would've personally liked to have seen more of the other characters rather than the two that the series focused on at the end.\\nOverview\\n+  Memorable main cast\\n+  Good supporting cast\\n-   Little screen time for most of the main cast towards the end\\nArt and Sound (7.34/10):  Working!! was animated by A-1 pictures, who you may know for animating anime such as Anohana, Oreimo, and the ever debated Sword Art Online.\\nIn terms of art, the anime gives off a light feel to it.  Everything from the background to the actual characters themselves are drawn in this semi-neon color palette where everything gives off a shade of white.  Everything looks rather simple, which for me, fits perfectly with the simple and easy storyline that the anime is following.\\nOn the other hand, we get chibi moments for whenever the comedy occurs.  All of these parts drawn in this style have your ordinary chibi feel to it where they all have a rather simple style to follow.  Not to say it's bad, but it doesn't really look out of this world amazing.\\nIn terms of sound, the anime features some pretty energetic and surprisingly catchy and memorable tracks for their opening and ending songs.  Their not bad in terms of listening to them, as they are quite catchy and energetic, but on the wow factor of anime songs, there are certainly more well known tracks out there to listen to.  But for what it's worth, they are good songs.\\nOverview:\\n+  Good light colored art\\n+  Catchy songs\\n-   Somewhat generic looking chibi art\\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.45/10):  For slice of life's, I always look for something unique to really grip me into the show.  There has to be something great and memorable to watch, if I'm going to continue watching it.  For this show, it was definitely the memorable characters.\\nTo say that I loved this show to death, is an overstatement.  To say I liked this show?  I'll give it that.  It's not a complicated show and it's not too simple.  Working!! has that very simple idea of slice of life animes that I like, combined with a more deeper connection between characters that you get more out of most slice of life animes.  It has that very nice feel good feel to it where you can watch one episode or two at a time, then continue it without problem some other time.  It's not complex, it's not simple, it's just a very charming little show that talks about the ins and outs of people at a workplace.\\nOverall Score: (7.73/10)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9093af1bc8ebb94a2c9760baf7dade43'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'This is my first review so please be gentle, take it easy, etc. etc etc.\\nFrom the director of both Sketchbook, Kaleido Star and Aria comes Working!!, a story about a relatively normal dude named Takanashi and the crazy shenanigans of his equally crazy co-workers playing out at the family restaurant Wagnaria.\\nOther than that there\\'s not much to say about the story of this anime; yup, it\\'s just another light-hearted slice-of-life, again.\\nPresentation-wise Working!! is excellent, A-1 has done a great job with both animation and sound. The music of the show fits like a glove, and the OP is incredibly catchy (WAN WAN), the ED... not\\nso much, but who cares. Most of the seiyuu also do a great job voicing the rather large cast of likeable characters.\\nThis isn\\'t really related, but Kamiya Hiroshi (Souma) and Ono Daisuke (Satou) do roles in Working!! which are incredibly similar to the roles they do in DRRR!! as Izaya and Shizuo respectively. I\\'d always humour myself with the thought of Izaya and Shizuo working out their disagreements after each episode, and then go to their part-time job at Wagnaria.\\nAlso, double exclamation marks seems to be a trend in anime titles these days.\\nBut I digress, let\\'s just take a look at Working!!s problems, namely the script. It\\'s sad when a bad script ruins what would usually be a much better anime. What is the problem with it? Well, the comedy of the show mostly depends on the quirks of the characters. This isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing in itself, but when you get the nth \"ZOMG SHE HAS A KATANA WITH HER AT WORK\"-joke it gets kinda tiresome, there\\'s a lot of crummy slapstick too. Furthermore, the later episodes mainly focuses on the romantic relationship between two characters whose names shall not be revealed in this review, which is rather badly done. Fortunately, the characters and quirks are many, and the romance episodes are relatively few.\\nAll in all Working!! is a enjoyable series with excellent presentation, a nice cast of characters, and a rather lacklustre script which is partially saved by good direction.\\nPeople who like slice-of-life will probably enjoy this, and vice versa for people who dislike it.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'faa1c98189cbb3eb3c007a1aaccc824'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The story starts with Sota Takanashi, a sixteen-year-old high school student. He is recruited by Popura Taneshima, an adorable but extremely short seventeen-year-old high school student, to work at the family restaurant Wagnaria, hence the American title. Takanashi accepts her request but is dragged into unforeseen working conditions. Wagnaria is just a normal family restaurant, but the employees aren\\'t exactly what he expects them to be.\\nWagnaria\\'s employees act as a dysfunctional but comical family. Popura is small enough to be mistaken as an elementary school girl, which is ironic because she was named after the poplar tree so she would grow tall. There\\'s Inami Mahiru\\nwho appears to be a normal seventeen-year-old girl but has sever androphobia. Her androphobia will cause her to punch any male that comes near her regardless of species, which tends to be, for better or worse, Takanashi. The Manager, Kyoko Shirafuji, is rather apathetic towards anything in the restaurant besides eating parfaits and whatever Wagnaria serves. Then there is Yachiyo Todoroki who has an obsessive admiration of the manager and carries around a katana while serving her customers.\\nFor Takanashi\\'s fellow male employees, there\\'s Jun Sato, and Hiroomi Soma. Jun Sato has a threatening appearance and acts quite intimidating, but is actually a very helpful guy. He often finds creative ways to tease or play pranks on Popura about her height. On the other hand, Hiroomi Soma may look like an easygoing cook, but he tends to blackmail his fellow co-worker into doing his job. He has a knack for getting information about others, and is curious about what his fellow workers are doing.\\nTakanashi\\'s fellow co-workers may seem like an odd bunch, but Takanashi himself is unaware of his own strange behavior. One thing I applaud of this series is that they introduce a new term for those who are misinterpreted as lolicons. What Takatsu introduces is the new term \"mini-con\", which is someone with an obsessive preference for anything that is small like puppies, kittens, children, and even water fleas. Takanashi adds more variety to the Wagnaria oddity.\\nThe thing that I loved most about this series is the voice actors. Coincidentally, or maybe not, all three male characters are voiced by seiyuus from Durarara!! in practically the same roles. We have Jun Fukuyama acting as Takanashi, who has that same perverted role he did for Shinra, Hiroshi Kamiya for Soma, the sadistic and know-it-all type as Izaya, and Daisuke Ono who plays the silent giant similar to Shizuo.\\nThe seiyuu for the female characters aren\\'t in the same situation as the males, but I have to say they were very amusing. We have Kana Asumi for Popura, who nearly has the same lines as Yuno in Hidamari Sketch. She provides this cute mascot-ish feel to Popura, making her action more adorable. Kumiko Watanabe performs Kyoko Shirafuji whose attitude is completely different from her performance as Keroro from Keroro Gunso, which surprised me. We have Eri Kitamura for Yachiyo Todoroki, which was quite new to me as I usually see her voice acting characters that are more energetic or youthful. Kitamura plays a more lady-like and mature role for Yachiyo, showing Kitamura\\'s new and interesting voice acting talents. Saki Fujita, who voiced the virtual idol, Hatsune Miku, plays the role of Mahiru Inami. Fujita does a great job switching from a shy and timid teenager to flustered, and sometime violent, androphobic.\\nWhat I enjoyed most out of this series is that it made me actually want to work in this kind of environment. I kid you not, I wouldn\\'t mind cleaning up the messes these characters bring as long as I got to mess around with them. Last time I checked, family restaurants, or any other type of restaurant, don\\'t have cute midget waitresses, katana-wielding waitresses, or even a blackmailing cook to serve people. I enjoyed Takatsu-sensei\\'s sense of comedy which, to me, wasn\\'t annoying or unbearable to watch, but was actually nicely done and didn\\'t really offend anyone. I also loved how Popura keeps on saying \"I\\'m not short!\" throughout the whole series, despite her own humiliation when she contradicts herself.\\nAnother thing I liked was the character designs by A-1 pictures. The character designs by Takatsu-sensei were simple and sketchy. For an anime, the characters would need details to make them alive, but at a minimum to stay close the original work. Looking at the manga and anime, I wasn\\'t disappointed in the design and was really happy to see them being animated. I really compliment A-1 for the character designs and making Takatsu sensei\\'s work come alive.\\nIf I had to pull out something I didn\\'t enjoy about this anime, I would say it was the tempo of each episode. Although the manga was a pretty simple 4-koma anime, I felt that this series took too long to develop. I felt like the anime took its time to fill the gap between each 4-koma of the manga so that the story would make sense. 4-koma manga are usually fast paced and need to shorten its storytelling to get to the point. Although I felt the anime\\'s storytelling was time consuming, it was something that couldn\\'t be helped when you\\'re transferring several short chapters from a six-page manga to a full 30 minute animation.\\nThere is just so much more I could talk about that makes the series both hilarious and charming, but I\\'ll resist spoiling it. I would recommend anyone, literally anyone, to watch this anime. I would have to say this show was one of the funnier and entertaining series that aired in spring 2010. If you\\'re interested in something with a story, you\\'ll likely find what you\\'re looking for around the last few episodes, but I would say the giggles packed into the anime will make up for it. There are even more characters to come in this series that will make Working!! more fun to watch. If you\\'re into slice-of-life type storytelling, get yourself to watch Wagnaria!! now! I would overall recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun show bundled with laughs.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '96e47ba2aafc7423f0cee71a323362f0'}>,\n",

I really love the art style, though I didn\\'t know that I would at first. There are times where it could be a little more intriguing-- mostly as far as environments and backgrounds go-- but the character designs were nice. The sound as well was a great companion to the anime itself.\\nThat\\'s stuff\\'s boring, though. The story was... right, so this is the kind of anime where there isn\\'t really a story, if that makes sense? There are developments with the characters, but for the most\\npart, you\\'re just hanging out with them episode to episode. While I\\'m talking about character developments, I actually really liked the way this anime did that. I felt like I could sense changes in the characters episode to episode without the plot having to directly address it. It was like their actual characteristics were being tweaked behind the scenes each episode, so it happened really gradually.\\nHowever, unfortunately, as I\\'ve said, this anime is a lot to deal with-- and that\\'s mostly because of the characters. I get that the gimmick with this anime is that each and every character is weird and quirky and unique, but damn, calm the hell down. It\\'s honestly really annoying to have to watch an anime where probably one character out of all of them can be described as \"typical.\" Unique characters are great, but in an anime where every freakin\\' character is supposed to be special, none of them are.\\nDespite that, though, a few of the characters\\' personalities were really fun at times, and there\\'s even a couple of characters that I really love.

One moment I was wondering if anything would ever feel normal about this anime and the next I was super invested in the characters\\' relationships with each other and what would happen next. So, clearly, it was fun to watch. The humor with this anime as well is done really well. I think that\\'s the one thing that benefits from the characters\\' strange personalities; it makes the humor special.\\nSo, yeah. Kind of a hard one to review. If I had to change anything that wouldn\\'t completely alter the premise of the show and its characters, it would probably be to include more serious moments or plots with all of the characters. I\\'d like to see something more dramatic happen that causes the humorous banter to stop for an episode just so I could get a taste of something different with the characters.

Not only are each and every character unique and interesting, they are all shown to a reasonable degree of depth, which made this show much more than just a boring animated sitcom.\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nThe show was definitely enjoyable. The plethora of characters and their amusing reactions and interactions kept a smile on my face throughout every episode.

There is even a proper beginning, middle and end. The show takes its time to slowly bring the characters together, with the little events they have in that restaurant, all building up to the end; such a rewarding end\\ntoo.

It is rare for me to connect so much with shows and definitely not in a slice of life. Yet I was so immersed in it that I felt sadness, pitty, happiness whenever the characters did. Inside I was cheering for their success, and get angry when they chicken out, but also enjoy their innocence.\\nAll I talked about was emotion but this is a comedy show after all. I love how the jokes would only work with those characters and no one else. Some of the gags are pretty funny but it usually needs the moe support. The real comedy is the characters cute attempts at getting together, which I can see why it might not be everyone's thing.\\nAnimations are crisp (I would say perfect for this series) and sound is great too. the ending was superb but not quite perfect (although to be fair its not easy to wrap up such an amazing series).

We thought that it would be a slice of life series we would enjoy so much....but it fell apart and for my friend and I there was one BIG problem. The main female character is supposed to be Popura (Poplar) Taneshima...it even says so on her information. The role of the main female character though seems to go over to Mahiru Inami....and that didn\\'t go over well with us. The series starts and Popura needs to find someone else to work at the restaurant\\nshe works at and ends up finding the main male character Souta Takanashi and bringing him along. He takes the job and then meets all of the quirky characters who work there where not one single person is normal but the characters personalities is one of the things that makes the series good, nobody is the same. Though there are again problems with this. Popura who is SUPPOSED to be the main girl character is very small and always called an elementary student...which makes no sense with her character design because to be blunt she has a large chest which I think obviously shows she\\'s seventeen. Also they make her seem too childish and dumb at times when she herself said she\\'s a science student and good at math so there\\'s no WAY she\\'s dumb. But again instead the role of main female character seems to go to Inami...who must be the most annoying character. She suffers from a phobia of men and has extreme strength so when she meets Souta she punches him again...and again...and AGAIN and it gets awfully repetitive with her doing the same thing. She\\'s also one of those characters who blushes at everything and stutters and is overly obsessed with chest sizes. I personally couldn\\'t stand how much the series focused on her, it literally gave both my friend and I a head ache. However all of the other characters even the not so important ones are great and really add feeling into the show. For those who are fans of Daisuke Ono, Jun Fukuyama and Hiroshi Kamiya all three of them have a great roll in the series. The humor in the series is great for the most part except the parts that are supposed to be \"funny\" or \"cute\" with Inami. For my friend and this series started as a 9 on episode one...then it just went down from there but it\\'s not TERRIBLE it\\'s just not the best. i love the opening and ending, i love the art, and I love most of the characters.

I will have the most easiest money-making job ever.\\n[Story]: (?/10)\\nThe show is set in a family restaurant named Wagnaria in the northern Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido. Souta, a new employee in Wagnaria, now works part-time among the restaurant\\'s high-spirited, mysterious, yet cool staffers.\\nBefore I get on to my review, I will no longer rate the \"Story\" category when reviewing slice-of-life anime. Most slice-of-life animes out there basically has\\na non-existing plot so it\\'s not fair to rate the story with a low score. My Overall rating will be mostly based on Enjoyment and Characters.\\nThe story of the show is the main protagonist gets a new part-time job from a loli 17 year old girl who he has never met before. From there, he meets his co-workers who are all a bunch of weirdos but those weirdos are the reason why the show is funny in the first place.\\nSurprisingly, the show\\'s fanservice is non-existent. There\\'s absolutely no fanservice...in a slice of life show. I never thought this day would come. There was one hotspring episode but there was no scene of them going inside the hotspring and getting naked. It just time-skipped\\nI want to talk about the comedy of the show before I wrap this category up. The comedy is......decent but not great. The problem is it got too repetitive. For example, Inami constantly punches Saito because of her \"disorder\". This was funny for the first few episodes but it got too repetitive. I admit though, I was still laughing in the second half of the show when they were still using the joke but not as much as the first time I saw it.\\nI\\'m not saying the jokes were bad, however. Most of the jokes in the show were pretty funny like Houma constantly blackmailing his co-workers, Popura being made fun of because her size, Sota\\'s creepy obsession, etc.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\nThe visuals and animation of the show looks pretty decent. The character design looks average and the character expressions are f*cking glorious. The expressions that they make are hilarious.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\nThe soundtrack is fairly average to say the least. They weren\\'t memorable to listen to nor were they forgettable. It\\'s a decent soundtrack. Now for the OP and ED theme song.\\nThe OP theme song is \"SOMEONE ELSE\" by Popura Taneshima, Mahiru Inami, and Yachiyo Todoroki and the ED theme songs are \"Heart no Edge ni Idomou Go to Heart Edge\" by Souta Takanashi, Jun Satou, and Souma Hiroomi and \"Golden Day\" by Mahiru Inami. The OP theme song is pretty catchy as hell. I mean, I don\\'t love the song and there are times where I want to skip the OP but can\\'t. It\\'s very catchy and I sometimes hum the song. Someone needs to help me stop. I\\'m not a fan of male J-Pop band so hearing the 1st ED theme song makes me cringe. The 2nd ED theme song, however, is a lot better than the 1st ED theme song and it\\'s unfortunate that it only played 1 episode.\\nThe voice actors are....ehh, I guess they\\'re ok. I didn\\'t hate any of the VA\\'s here. The VA that I love the most is Yamada\\'s VA. I just love her voice when she acts all childish towards her co-workers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[Characters]: (8.5/10)\\nNo.High.School.Students.Finally...Oh wait, most characters are high school students but what makes this different from other slice-of-life animes is the fact that the show doesn\\'t take place in a high school setting. It takes place in a work-place environment. Just like most slice-of-life out there, the show relies on character interactions to move the plot...I mean, the show forward and for the show to have a comedy. When these characters get together, it can lead to funny situations. Not only that, but you also see minor character development. By watching the show from the first episode to the last episode, you will see some notable changes in the characters and these changes are very obvious when it comes to Inami.\\nTime to introduce the MAIN characters. First, we have Sota who is a lolicon but he said he\\'s not because he also loves cute and small things like pets, those cute toys, and those little germ-like creatures..I forget what they were called. Then, we have Poplar who is a 17 year old teenage girl but she is somehow the height of a kid. This is why she gets made fun of most of the time. Then, we have Inami who is suffering from a phobia called \"androphobia\" and this is the first I knew of this phobia. Her phobia causes her to become scared of men and punch them if they get near her. Sato suffers the most because of her phobia. Apparently, her dad is an overprotective/pedophile/perverted asshole  nd told lies to her daughter (back when she was just a kid) about men and how \"scary\" they were.\\nThe rest of the female casts are Kyouko, Yamada and Yachiyo. Kyouka is the manager of the restaurant and all she does in the store is eat and be a lazy ass. Yamada is a character later introduced in the show and she is apparently \"lost\". More like she ran away because she probably finds her parents annoying or something. She now lives in the attic of the restaurant. Yachiyo is a girl who was constantly bullied back when she was a little kid, hence the reason why she carries a sword. She likes making food, particularly parfait, to Kyouko.\\nThe rest of the male casts are Jun and Hiroomi. I\\'ll skip Jun because there\\'s nothing interesting about him. Hiroomi, on the other hand, is one of the most interesting characters in the show. The guy likes to blackmail his co-workers.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[Enjoyment]: (7/10)\\nI\\'m a fan of slice-of-life animes but for whatever reason, I didn\\'t enjoy this show that much when compared to other slice-of-life animes out there. By the time I\\'m writing this review, I haven\\'t watched second season yet and I probably won\\'t for a long time.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[VERDICT]\\n\"Working!!\" is a decent slice-of-life anime. It\\'s not particularly the best slice-of-life show but it is watchable. The show didn\\'t have the best comedy out there but it still made me laugh despite the constant uses of the same joke.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Review: Working!!\\n\"Why is this rated a 7.82!? This anime is great!\"\\nStory (7/10): Concerning of plot, the story has no framework. The anime just revolves many main characters and involves their everyday lives of \\'working\\' in a restaurant. Besides that point, each of their personalities pale in comparison from each other. As a result their personalities mix in oddly well making their everyday lives pleasantly humorous to watch. If there was a framework to follow on however, it isn\\'t until one of the the main character steps into play. Her androphobia, and the cause behind it. Androphobia is the fear of men and the fact of\\nthe matter is, she has to constantly have to deal with it with everyday life. Despite her fear of men, she works at Wagnaria where it is inevitable where there may be men at. With the help of main characters however, they push her to get over her fear of androphobia. Through hilarious trials and consequences, the main characters help her inch away out of her fear of men. Even though there may be a little to no plot, the anime is enjoyable to watch nevertheless.\\nArt (8/10): Like the name clearly states, A-1 Pictures. Nothing is better than A-1 really. The art direction for the opening theme coming into this anime is eye-catching and amusing to see. That can be said with the ending theme following of the anime. To mention, A-1 did a excellent job in catching every detail that it had to offer to the character designs to the scenery. With this particular anime being the based on a 4-koma manga, the animation is grand and the manga pales in comparison. That\\'s all I have to say!\\nSound (9/10): Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, and Fukuyama Jun are all in one place as they voice all the male main characters in the series. With that being the case, it is particularly interesting to hear their voices. Since they are known voicing many characters from all different series people all know and love. I can quite say all the voice actors did their voice roles well. Especially, when it came to one of the main heroines, Taneshima. To mention, her voice is irresistibly cute. For the music however, the opening coming into this can compare to opening themes such as Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and Nicjijou. Catchy and up-lifting. For the the ending theme however, the ending theme is soothingly jazzy hearing all the male \\'seiyuu\\' mentioned above sing the ending theme at each episode which was a highlight of this anime. The music was one of its strong points as it created a \\'fun atmosphere\\' for this anime to watch.\\nCharacter (9/10): The character lineup was definitely bizarre and large in comparison to some anime. Not to mention that one character looked like Sanji out of One Piece. It refreshing to see some characters were not being used out of the anime trope. However, there were a few characters that used the anime trope, but weren\\'t overused to the point it became a nuisance. They were original as each of them had a quirk or trademark to remember them by. The large lineup and the liveliness of the characters is also one of its strong points making the anime enjoyable to watch.\\nEnjoyment: (7/10): Managed to binge-watch this anime throughout one go. It\\'s easy and fun to watch since it\\'s a refreshing anime to watch. There wasn\\'t a boring moment when it came to this anime. Definitely humorous and laughed out loud.\\nOVERALL: (8/10): Season two will be on a look out since this was a refreshing anime to watch. Despite the story, the characters and how they interact with each other in their everyday life is amusing. Each character and their own little quirky personalities are rememberable despite having so many characters. It\\'s what this makes this anime look forward to. The art direction from A-1 Pictures could not have been better as the character designs and scenery had little to none flaws at all. With Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi and Fukuyama Jun singing karaoke at the end at each episode and the comedic relief this anime comes out with is relaxing. Overall, this anime is perfect if done with watching a favorite anime, having a bad day, or have an anime to watch on the weekend! Definitely recommend this anime to watch!\\nRAW SCORE: 7.8/8.0\\nOVERALL SCORE: 8.0/10.0', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ef6f7faaad615246f3d56cf0f0be8878'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '***SPOILERS AHEAD*** (hahahahhaha, spoilers in SoL, hahahha)\\nWhat do you call occurrence whereas every single one of your side characters is more interesting than your main girl? It\\'s called having shit taste so kill her off and focus on more interesting stuff you wanker.\\nThat about sums up my initial thoughts after finishing Working!!. And now, let\\'s go in deep, because stating the obvious is never enough.\\nThis anime is 100% episodic without any underlying plot whatsoever - unless you mean to tell me that their \"attempts\" to \"cure\" Inami\\'s \"illness\" can be considered underlying plot - meaning that there is no story. Every episode\\ndeals with different issues or whatever, some introducing new characters, butchering existing ones and so on. So I won\\'t rant about the story mainly because there\\'s literally nothing to rant about. Meh.\\nArt and sound were fair - not exceptional, just fair. There are some animation issues here and there but for the most part it was consistent in being above average. One that really stuck with me though happens in the last episode, near the beginning, when Inami is preparing for a \"date\". The mirror shot of her is so godawful I have a feeling 13y old intern animated it.\\nSound is a tad bit worse than art overall, but it wasn\\'t half-bad. Music is meh, opening and ending weren\\'t particularly catching either, but voice actors held up their part so it\\'s all fine and good.\\nNow that we moved from the shit I don\\'t really care about, let\\'s talk some characters. Mmm. Tasty.\\nFirst off we have Inami. I\\'m not one of the people who find abusive comedy funny, or abusive characters funny or interesting, so you can already tell this bitch didn\\'t really sit well with me. I figured she would be the first girl to receive and arc, it would take like 3 episodes or something to resolve her issues, but god fucking no it had to take up the entire god fucking season. I mean, holy crap what the flying fuck? Her character is flat out not interesting, nor are her problems. First off, they\\'re not represented in a serious matter so that you are given a chance to actually explore mentality of people with this illness, and when it comes to comedy it\\'s just the same fucking joke over and over and over again. How many times can you find a guy getting punched in the face funny? Just how many fucking times?\\nShe\\'s literally my primary reason for disliking this show. Strip away her fucking illness and she\\'s your everyday fucking wall. Instead of having thrown her into the background after resolving her \"issues\" within first 4 episodes, we\\'re strung along for 13 episodes of this mayhem-bringing bitch that most people actually find TOLERABLE, FUNNY and INTERESTING. Why? Because she supposedly likes our MC or because she can\\'t help but hit guys? What kind of a shitty ass excuse is that? I literally put more effort into my high school math than she did into \"curing\" her \"illness\". For 13 whole fucking episodes there is NO progress. No. Fucking. Progress. Watching her punch our MC, either due to her \"illness\" or \"shyness\" over and over again isn\\'t fucking funny. It\\'s just annoying, unnecessary and irrelevant. Instead of focusing onto the far superior side characters, who are better in virtually every aspect you can think of, this bitch takes so much screen time you begin to realize that there\\'s no way that the writer isn\\'t a heavy M. Take any, and I mean ANY side character who\\'s gotten more than 30 seconds of screen time, and there would have been far more interesting to explore. Starting with other employees to MC\\'s fucking sisters. Fuck. This. Type. Of. A. Character.\\nIf you\\'re gonna pretend like her problems are fucking serious, don\\'t use her problems as fucking comedic relief moments in your shitty excuse of a story. And no, 9th episode did abso-fucking-loutely nothing for me. Yes, her father was a cunt, so what? In any sane world she wouldn\\'t be working part-time in a fucking FAMILY restaurant - she\\'d be locked up in a fucking asylum because that\\'s where she fucking belongs.\\nNow, most people will obviously rant about the side characters. Why? Because they\\'re underdeveloped. And why are they underdeveloped? Because that bitch takes about every inch of screen time she can fucking take. Every single side characters they introduced fell right with me and, episode after fucking episode, I kept hoping they\\'d expand more on them, but why the fuck would they do that when they can focus their attention to the psychotic excuse of a fucking character.\\nAs much as I ranted on about the show, I actually had a fun time with Working!!. As I said, my primary source of disdain is the main girl and each time when the show would focus on the interactions of side characters I had a blast. The reason, though, that I was never really able to get into them is because they virtually get 0 development and focus. The most you\\'ll find here is a dude confessing to girl, which is then completely, and I mean COMPLETELY disregarded as the focus moves back onto our favorite psychotic failed-abortion.\\nIf you love shows with abusive MC, kind of like Louise in ZnT, you\\'ll have cum stains all over your monitor after you\\'ve finished watching this. If, on other hand, you\\'d at least want some kind of fucking development and seriousness regarding the \"issue\", you\\'ll have lost all your hope halfway through.\\nktxbai.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5e06167112f16d42043446e7f93ccf7d'}>,\n",

Each with their own little quirky personality.\\nThe big idea with this show is the plot never really goes anywhere. We simply get taken through some time at the restaraunt. And that\\'s fine. No one says there needs to be a big developed plot. One of my favourite anime (School Rumble) has hardly any closure in it\\'s story\\nfor 2 full seasons!

It\\'s literally a shmorgusboard (that is totally how you spell that word) of archetypes all crammed into one dysfunctional restaurant. But surprisingly, despite what seems like an effort to appeal to all audiences, they manage to fit everyone together fairly well.\\nSo where do I have a problem with Working!! if they do everything well?\\nThis anime is just filler to me. It\\'s just a bunch of episodes which are fairly amusing, and I know if I watch it I\\'d laugh and enjoy it. But I found it really hard to motivate myself to watch all of it. It just doesn\\'t provide that kind of drive, and is (in my opinion) difficult to marathon, despite only being a half series. The comedy is textbook, so much so that anyone who\\'s watched their fair share of anime can predict the plays before they happen. Some of the jokes get repeated a bit too often, and lose their punch (even the punches lose their punch, baha! You\\'ll get that if you watch it).\\nHonestly, the show itself is fine.

So I have really no idea what compelled me to watch a show that appeared to be, in all aspects, a 100% authentic slice of life, right down to the core. And watch it I did...  After 3 or 4 episodes, it dawned on me that I was actually enjoying it.\\nStunned by this revelation, I decided to delve in a little deeper and see why I liked this particular anime; if perhaps I could actually enjoy slice of life.\\nSo anyways... here\\'s Working!!. As most any anime with this kind of standing goes, plot is pretty irrelevant. Its not trying to convey a moral or story, its just an anime that\\'s meant to give us a good time, maybe a laugh, or some form of nostalgic feeling. What really matters is the characters... and whether you can a). be entertained by them or b). relate to them. For me, I was actually fairly refreshed with the characters of Working!!. They weren\\'t exactly standout-ish characters, but they had a fairly original feeling about them (even though their general outline has been done before). I\\'ll give you an example of what I mean. When I first saw Poplar (the short one) I immediatly said \"She is going to have a inferiority complex, and every joke around her will be about how she is shorter than she should be\". And lo and behold I was mostly right (although around about episode 8 this starts to change). But I was oddly amused with its approach in this field. Rather than making fun of the fact that she was short, it more made fun of the fact that she tried to be big. That may not seem like much... but it made a world of difference for me.\\nAlmost every character in the show did this to me. To put it simply... they were fairly generic characters, but were put in a different light than they usually are portrayed as. Another example is the main? girl Inami. At first you think... bah its that girl... u know the one who hits the guy repeatedly for no real good reason. But, whats fairly different about Inami, is that she really doesn\\'t want to hit men... she just does out of instinct. They even give a kinda okay explanation as to why she must hit men, and it helped me a lot in warming up to her character. All in all... the cast isn\\'t going to be winning awards anytime soon... but I found them a much more able bunch than I first gave them credit for.\\nHmmm.... well there\\'s not much let to say after that long winded speech on characters. As I said, characterization is really the MOST important thing in this slice of life comedy. I can\\'t really say if you\\'ll find it funny or not, cause everyone has a pretty unique sense of comedy... But I personally found the jokes hit and miss. A lot of run on gags get going after a while, and it can get tiring, but it still gave me a couple chuckles every episode.\\nAnd that\\'s my opinion on Working!!. Its not a spectacular, and you could easily hate it a lot more than I did... But for what its worth, I found it quite enjoyable, and it helped re-kindle a interest in anime that I thought was starting to die out. If you do watch it, at least give it a bit of a chance before you decide your opinion on it.\\nOh and one final note, this is the ONLY anime where I have ever caught myself softly attempting to sing along with the opening... Its that annoyingly catchy.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9c70bae0b775af74f278c308345d8060'}>,\n",

It\\'s basically about the antics of the employees of a certain family restaurant with having no particular plot whatsoever. It really gives that feel of life as a working student. Of course, watching people work for the next 30 minutes wouldn\\'t be so exciting.... So how about this? We add an androphobic girl that can turn your face inside-out, a teenager who is obsessed with small things, a manager that doesn\\'t do zilch, a shady person who knows everybody\\'s secrets, a dumbfounded, lethal waitress that adores the manager, and a\\npoor cook who\\'s stuck in the friend zone, and a bunch of other weird characters, and mix them all in strange situations as they do their work at the same time. Sound good?\\nI honestly can\\'t explain Working!! without mentioning the characters that make up the backbone of the entire anime. There isn\\'t really much of a plot in Working!! So as a slice of life anime, it\\'s a little strange. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. Although I did encounter some problems along the way.\\nAs I said before, There isn\\'t really a plot in this. It\\'s just about well... people working. Sometimes the plot form the episodes connect, sometimes they don\\'t. It\\'s a pretty light anime, so don\\'t expect any deep plot-lines.

This is probably the only thing that separates it from other \"working\" anime. They are all most certainly unique and you will never have any trouble differentiating them either. The character development its done cleanly so there won\\'t be that many confusing parts.\\nThere is something that bothers me though. I don\\'t know why, but I have this sort of loathing feeling for Takanashi. I really don\\'t know why. He just gives me this strange, heavy sensation.

The story develops slowly over time. It\\'s more or less a comedy not concentrated on the story, but the characters instead. So I gave the story a bit lower score then most everything else\\nbecause it doesn\\'t sound interesting. But, the other categories makes up for that.\\nArt -\\nThe art is normal. Not great, not bad. To be honest I really like it and think it\\'s very good. The characters are drawn to my liking. No characters except maybe one of Souta\\'s sisters is ecchi. Very good anime in this aspect.\\nSound -\\nThe opening and ending aren\\'t bad at all. Better then most of the anime out there.\\nCharacter -\\nThis is where this anime shines. The character development even for the side characters of the anime play a big part.\\nInami, Mahiru\\nA 17 year old high school girl who has androphobia (scared of men) and beats the hell out of them when she is around them. She is forced to work with Souta and they start to develop a excruciating bond with each other.\\nTakanashi, Souta\\nA 16 year old who is highly addicted to cute things and kids under the age of 12. Popura is the only exception to this category. He doesn\\'t hold back with opinions and adapts very quickly to his surroundings.\\nSatou, Jun\\nA 20 year old who has a very strong love from Yachiyo. He is very intimidating and often picks on Popura whenever something goes wrong or aggravates him. (usually to do with Yachiyo)\\nTodoroki, Yachiyo\\nA 20 year old who carries around a katana on her side and usually scares the customers she greets at the tables. For the most part she is normal unless it comes to protecting the manager Kyouko.\\nSouma, Hiroomi\\nA chef and man of mystery. He knows everything about everyone but, no one knows much about him.\\nShirafuji, Kyouko\\nA manager who doesn\\'t know or do much. She is very dependent on the people around her. She comes off as very intimidating as well. She is part of a type of gang.\\nYamada, Aoi\\nA girl who says she is 16 because Souta is 16, She is mysterious and is said to have run away from home. She often screws up and can never do much right.\\nEnjoyment -\\nI laugh a lot and I find this anime very enjoyable. Each episode brings something a bit new and unique to the table. I also like to watch the relationships develop between the characters. Certain parts can have you laughing out loud.\\nOverall -\\nOne of the best Slice-of-life/Comedies out there.

Working!! offers a genre different from the mainstream manga/anime which results to elation for some who are really bored from the \"fighting and acquiring of new skills\" such as Bleach and Naruto.\\nThe bottom line is that this is a spectacular and a \"getaway\" anime for those who are bored and want something different. Although it may seem very short, I felt that 13 episodes are more than enough, since the author will eventually run out of gags and repetitions will cause it to lose its novelty.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Working!! is a slice-of-life anime about the employees of a family restaurant, Wagnaria. And... that's just about it for the story. There's not much plot (if there is any), and for the first few episodes, each scene practically has nothing to do with the next, filled with the most random conversations. The characters are introduced, and it's as if the 'plot' is being set up. For the second half of the anime, this is when the episodes seem more linear, giving each episode a solid story, instead of giving it just the random scenes we saw in the start. The story seems to start to\\nfocus on Inami's phobia of men and how Takanashi tries to help her overcome it. Despite the fact that it now has a story that it sticks to, it's still a very light-hearted, and never touches into anything deeper than comedy. The plot never moves, and even after the last episodes, nothing has changed between the characters.\\nThe art is good. The character designs are all fantastic, and I'm amazed by how much detail the animators give each character to give them their personality. The movements are very fresh and crisp, making the characters seem as lively as they should be. The anime showcases some lively and upbeat songs as well, and while it's nothing unique, it can be quite catchy.\\nThe characters are the main focus of the show. We are given their personalities and some basic background, and the show works from there. We never find out anything 'deep' about them, but in a light-hearted comedy like this, that's justified. All the characters all have one (or two) strange quirks to them that makes them unique from everyone else, and it seems as if every reaction they show is based on this quirk.\\nThis anime is quite enjoyable if you're looking for something to rest your mind on from all the stress of your day. It's refreshing to watch, and it seems to give you the illusion that there's no such thing as real-life problems (unless you think a co-worker hitting you all the time because you're a guy is a plausible thing to worry about). If you enjoy shows that make you feel less stressed and helps you forget about everyday problems, then you will enjoy this.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"As it is with all things, there is a certain stereotype that goes with each different type of anime out there today.  Harems typically toss character out of the window, action/mecha often defy logic and the romance genre generally contains unrealistic scenarios for plot development.  Not to say that this is a necessarily bad thing, of course; they serve their respective categories well.  However it is true that an anime viewer usually goes into a type of show expecting something.  Working!! both followed and diverged from this.\\nWhen it comes to the\\nstorytelling element of this show, it doesn't exactly shine, but that's fine.  A show about part timers and their numerous exploits is bound to be lacking when it comes to plot, and in this case it actually becomes a selling point.  The premise is just enough to set up the characters to have all the fun they possibly can at the workplace.  There is no general cohesive plotline, just a real mish-mash of many moments among the characters.\\nThe art also wasn't spectacular, but once again this is tolerable.  For an anime that was released in 2010 with what was likely an initially low budget, the artists seem to have done their best.  Character designs are not exactly innovative but they are diverse enough to keep the interest going.  Not to mention that the second season of the anime offered an overhaul on the presentability with improved animation quality.\\nNow I'll come out and say this bluntly-the music in this anime is almost subpar.  I am aware of the massive popularity with the first season's opening garnered, but beyond that sound is not used very often to accentuate high points in the show (as few as they are).  All the OP does is set the tone for a bright and bubbly experience, but beyond that it does nothing.\\nDespite these inefficiencies, however, I still enjoyed the show, and that was due to the chemistry.  As re-hashed as they may be, the workers of Working!! play off each other very well.  Whether it be a running gag or a sudden punchline, the anime at least does a good job on delivering the comedic aspect of the show.  Upon reflection, I found that the majority of the anime's humor relied heavily of a multitude of running gags; such as the boss's obsession with Yachio's parfait and a punching problem from a certain meek girl.  However, this does not make them dull.  Rather, it shows the quality of said gags since they can be used so often with continued success.\\nOverall, Working!! was an enjoyable but slightly flawed anime, though I can't really blame it due to its rather unspectacular premise.  I feel that the creators did well considering what they had to work with.

The show uses many kinds of humor, some more culture specific than others, and should appeal to many kinds of people. The characters interact in surprisingly believable ways considering how much the show focuses on humor.\\nLike many comedy anime, Working!! throws a group of characters together to create a situation for humor. However, in most cases, this effort seems labored and implausible. The approach is basically: 1. Create weirdos with the most extreme quirks you can. 2. Make up a reason for them to be stuck together. 3. Do a bunch of random stuff and hope some of\\nit gets a laugh. Working!! doesn’t discard the formula. It just does the whole thing better. It uses characters more like real people instead of freaks you would only see in an anime. They come together as coworkers (much less contrived). The humor comes from their interactions, instead of whatever random events a mangaka decided to shoehorn them into so he could make his deadlines.\\nOn that note, the characters drive the show.

Almost nonexistent, most of the anime is about daily interactions and gags between the odd individuals in the show, and that\\'s where most of the fun factor comes from.

To be frank whole anime is filled with weirdos. All the female characters are powerful over the male leads in a particular aspect except for \"Hiroomi Souma\" he too has a kryptonite.... All the characters are well designed to form a great humor....\\nOverall the I had great amount of enjoyment over watching this anime......

It really is.\\nOur main cast is the staff of a restaurant, usually focusing around main lead and the eventual pairing he has with one of the other staff members.\\nOf course, each have their unique traits, habits, work ethics and ideas. Typical usage of the many character tropes we come to expect in anime.\\nBut the charisma and interactions between characters is what makes this whole show an enjoyable roll of\\ncomedy. Mostly surrounding their job and working at the restaurant.\\nIt differs in the sense that sitcoms usually have one episode as its own, whereas things will continue from episode to episode for about 4 of them. This does allow character progression and building.\\nIt's great they have this too, because there are so many things that each person has that can't really be done up so simple and short.\\nLove at the work place. Dealing with customers. Balancing work and home. Trying to be professional but stay themselves at the same time.\\nIt's the cast that makes it all fun. The plot points aren't heavy or critical, but they do allow characters to have some freedom in what they do.\\nI never tired of seeing them work on the issue of one of the staff have a phobia of men.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Wow, can you guess? Rabb2t reviews another anime!\\nStory: The story and plot of Working!! is much like the previous Slice of Life animes that I've reviewed. It has charm in the details that are part of the story, but overall the main story isn't much. It follows random antics that occur throughout the year in a restaurant. However, this still allows for lots of charm to be put into a plot, which Working!! does pretty well. The small details in plot lead into character, but occasionally some do not, like the scenes where Souta crossdresses. You expect something like that to be a recurring gag,\\nbut it becomes a plot device that helps build character.\\nArt: For something from 2010, the art is actually quite good. It's shown a bit of age, but the art still has some effects and visuals that look pretty good by today's standards. Some of the light effects look great, and the occasional chibi character fits the mood of the anime. Overall, however, it's pretty standard.\\nSound: The sound in Working!! is something that I liked a lot. Something I found to like hearing every episode is the reactions the characters had to each other. Souta reacting to him getting punched by Inami was always something funny, and her reactions somehow never got old. The chill attitude of Satou also helped bring out his character too. Music wise, I found the background music to be something I really liked in particular. The piano accompanied the setting of a family diner well, and the tame drumset also allowed for an overall chill and quiet mood to settle in. The opening of this anime was also a treat, being upbeat and getting you ready for the antics of the episode, and the ending's rock and roll style was a nice touch to ease you out of the episode.\\nCharacter: The characters in this anime were pretty charming, although I did feel they could have used a bit more development, which probably was helped in the next 2 seasons. All the characters have distinct personalities, but outside of maybe 2 or 3 main qualities, they were a bit static. For instance, the manager. She starts off as someone who doesn't work in general, but then she's told to try to do some work. That fails, and she ends up being the same as she was in the beginning. The only things that seem to change happens after the introduction of Yamada. After she comes to work at the restaurant, all sorts of new things happen. The unrequited love Satou has for Todoroki is shown, Inami's androphobia is slightly lessened, etc. This all allows for a good basis of change that's more for series with more than 2 seasons, which I think works for this series, but it's something I'm not entirely used to.\\nEnjoyment: Let me say that I enjoyed this anime. It has distinct characters all clashing and mixing together to create a dysfunctional cast of oddballs, which all create some funny scenes. I can't say much else except for that although characters were more on the building stage, I still found the show to have a charm that was enjoyable.\\nOverall: So, what's my overall thoughts on this show? I found it charming, with personality being shown in every character and scene. It's something extremely light-hearted, being a show that really anyone could watch. It's not too serious, and humour is not all over the place. I'd recommend this anime for those who enjoy Slice of Life + Comedy duos. Anyways, those are my thoughts, so see for yourself!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '639fbb1c0f29093013c6c7731f311a09'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'tl;dr Pretty vanilla show overall, and I did not feel it offered anything especially unique or memorable. At the same time it was very enjoyable, and I think that aspect of Working!! is really playing to its strengths in developing something unique in its own way.\\nStory: 7\\nOverall plot was fairly typical, and nothing was exceptionally unrealistic (barring things that typically beg some suspension disbelief to drive any series). I can\\'t say anything particularly stood out to me as a prime story point, but I also can\\'t really say there was anything I particularly felt was done poorly.\\nStill, to me the story merits a 7 because\\nI felt those traits were intentional. In an anime literally titled \"Working!!\" it made sense to me that things were portrayed in a fairly vanilla light. Some scenes could have easily been made significantly more dramatic, but in some sense that would feel too typical, especially because in real life, things do not slow down with dramatic music and closeups on people\\'s faces. When something happens in a restaurant, people typically kinda just look over from their seats.\\nArt: 7\\nUse of chibi images and dramatic backgrounds didn\\'t feel force nor overused. Nothing especially notable about style in my opinion, but it was consistent in portrayal of characters and such. Consistency alone without doing anything particularly disruptive to me is worth a rating of \"Good\" here. Following the idea above that the vanilla characteristics of this series work to its benefit as it represents working, I feel similarly here.\\nSound: 6\\nNo particular background track stood out to me, and I tend to make an effort to pay attention to something like that, though I will say I found the opening theme oddly catchy. It may feel inconsistent for me to give a 6 to yet another fairly plain, typical aspect of this show, but I will defend the rating of \"Fair\" with noting that in the presence of a work of fiction (namely an animation that puts together moving visuals and sound), I personally feel there is some responsibility to do something that adds flavor or mood to scenes. Still, nothing was disruptive or poorly done in my opinion, so maintaining the overall feel of this show by not trying to do anything particularly flashy pushes this above average for me.\\nCharacter: 7\\nCharacters didn\\'t seem to break the mold much and they all sort of felt to remain just as you expect; however, there was definitely some character development as the series progressed--enough that I am confident in saying the characters were good. It felt to me like how you spend a year or so in school with someone and even without much interaction you feel you get to know them better.\\nI felt this characteristic augmented this series in a lot of ways. Even so, what makes me leave it at 7 rather than an 8 is there were definitely times when I was just personally irked by a couple characters. Not necessarily by them not being well done or acting out of character, but in the sense that I just personally would be very annoyed if I were anyone in that restaurant.\\nEnjoyment: 8, Overall: 8\\nThis review follows the second time I watched this series after forgetting I watched it at all a while back and only remembering some character traits. I would say I enjoyed it quite a lot, especially considering with the overall atmosphere of this show it was a good fit for watching when I was in the mood for a slice of life type of kickback. I personally really appreciate when a series can be consistent the whole way through, and this did a very good job of that.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ce92ea23066235a618618d3fa658954a'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"-This review is based on my opinion of the show and you don't have to agree or disagree with it.\\n-This review will review all 3 seasons plus the special of the Working!! series.\\nWorking is a slice of life and comedy anime. The story is set in a restaurant named Wagnaria and shows all of it's employees and their interactions with each other to create the comedy.\\nAs it is a slice of life anime, it doesn't really have a story. Working just follows our characters and their everyday life working in Wagnaria. This anime does have character development. Season 1 is focused on introducing the characters\\nand their running jokes. Season 2 feels the same as season 1 and still keeps up the comedy. Season 3, however, have more character development then the previous seasons. The special is a nice wrap up to conclude the series.\\nThe comedy in this anime is good but not that amazing. All of the characters have their running gags. There are some of the jokes that i like but what i don't like is that the running jokes are overused. Some of them may be funny at first or still be funny later but i don't really like seeing the same joke being used too much. Thankfully, they don't use the joke too repetitively after some episodes.\\nSeason 3 starts to resolve all of the character's problem that was given from the past 2 seasons. I liked seeing the character development. You can see the character development clearly between seasons especially at season 3 where the resolve all of the problems.\\nThe art is nice and just fits the scenes. Nothing too notable from here.\\nAll of the openings and endings in the series were sung by the series' characters. The openings was sung by the females and the ending by the males. I like when openings or endings is sung by the characters because it adds to the feeling of the opening/ending. The opening and ending has the same feeling from all seasons. The opening is upbeat and fun and the ending is a bit slower.\\nAll of the characters has their obvious ups and downs. Some running jokes are created by the interaction of 2 characters. Even though the running jokes are overused, it's nice that they modify it to keep them funny sometimes. The side characters also have their own distinct qualities and running gags and their own share of development. Some of the characters may seem just plain dumb reacting at some situations but i think that's the part of the characters.\\nI enjoyed this series for some of it's comedy and the character development that i see at the last season. The jokes may be too repetitive at times but sometimes made funnier with the characters' reaction. Season 3 and the special is really nice to add the character development and to finish all of the problems that the the characters had.\\nI think that this anime's comedy is fine and can be enjoyed by others as well. It is worth it to watch until the end to to see all the development at Season 3. Overall it's a nice comedy anime that sometimes gets too repetitive with the jokes but still tried to make them funny. It shows the character development and ends everything at the end, not leaving anything unanswered.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '10f294e6eada9dfb6cdffc768eb7b15b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The anime series of ‘working!!’ is absolutely exceeding the quality of the mange series. In Japanese forum it has been said that the quality of anime all thanks to the Anime Producers but not to the original author of manga. As my personal opinion I need to admit that it is actually true that the quality of Anime is overwhelming that of manga, however, there is still a major flaw to this anime series which is the length. It was just too short to construct the convincing structure of a season. This was of course not a special matter to this anime but also to\\nthe entire 2010 spring anime series which mostly ended around 13 episodes. It was most likely an anime launched to target the fans of manga series who know the original story; and I suggest that was why it was too short. Observing the popularity of the anime and the manga, the possibility of season 2 seems positive as long as the original author stays healthy enough to continue writing. I cross my fingers for the season 2.\\nExcepting the length of series the aggregate quality of the anime was quite fine as the quality drove me buy the manga series to read the episodes left out from the original lines in the anime series.\\nSpeaking of some other reviews I read, other reviewers were pretty dissatisfied with the lack of completeness in the series, meanwhile, as I mentioned it was just too short to conclude as an anime series.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"That Popura army from the opening can invade my country any day.\\nStory:\\nWorking is a romantic comedy that didn’t forget that it’s a comedy, which is an accomplishment in itself. The main focus is on the humor, though the romance part is featured prominently, especially in the latter episodes. As a non-fan of tsundere antics, I wasn’t the biggest fan of the man-hitting girl plot that takes the majority of airtime, but I have to say, they did a good job in playing it equally straight and for laughs. It also works because the characters make it work, but that is something I’m gonna discuss a\\nlittle later. Something else I found Working did astonishingly well was the romantic development. There was no crushing-into-each-other-at-the-first-day-of-school kind of meeting between the characters, but specific events that made them feel the way they do. While we’re at it, the setting this time is NOT school, but a restaurant. Nowadays, that is almost revolutionary. But all that good writing would be for nothing if the jokes aren’t good. So, are they? Yes, most of them. Inami punching Takanashi gets old real quick, but everything else was really funny.\\n9/10\\nArt:\\nAs it’s the case in almost every comedy anime, the character design is rather simplistic, but as I’ve already stated a million times, that’s absolutely okay, as it usually works well with the comedic effects. This also counts for Working, so I have no reason to complain. What really threw me off-guard however, was the high amount of movement this anime had. The characters are nearly always in motion, which looked quite amazing.\\n9/10\\nSound:\\nThe opening song is the reason I started watching this anime. It’s incredibly catchy and absolutely hits my personal taste. The ending song was also pretty good, as was the episode 9 special ending, which was surprisingly sweet. The voice acting was good all throughout the cast, everybody was able to hit their characters the way they should be.\\n10/10\\nCharacters:\\nAt first I thought that Popura would be the female lead. I mean, she is cute and funny, what is not to like? But because of the romantic developments slowly moving into the focus, she was cast aside more and more. The lack of screen time almost turned her into a one joke-character, but fortunately, the writing was good enough to not let that happen. The actual main characters, Takanashi and Inami, were a likeable couple the viewer can root for to get together. As I already mentioned, the violence joke got old after a while, but the way it was handled made it bearable and turned it into an at least interesting plot point. Shout out to Mahirus Dad for being a worse father than Gendo Ikari. The secondary couple (Satou and Todoroki) was surprisingly sweet. Satou is an obvious expy of Sanji, but a lot more down to earth and not woman-crazy, even in the face of the one he likes. Todoroki was a sweet girl with a violence trigger when it comes to Kyouko-san and easy to fool. An interesting mix that worked really well within these two. I hope they get more time and development in the next season (which I’m sure they will). The rest of the Wagnaria staff was also quite entertaining. Souma, the manipulative bastard, Yamada, the annoying little brat and antidote to Souma and the already mentioned cutie pie Popura. The only one who fell a little flat was Kyouko, who turned out to be the aforementioned one joke-character. The rest of the supporting cast did what they needed to, but weren’t all that memorable.\\n8/10\\nEnjoyment:\\nWorking was a very funny watch, more than I expected. Although, I don’t really know what I expected…but anyway. The characters were all either very likeable or unimportant enough to look over, the humor worked out most of the time and the romantic developments were written well and believable. If there’s something I’d feel the show could improve on, it would be less punching and more of the other characters (for me, more Popura please). If you are tired of the high school setting or simply want a romantic comedy that is both, romantic and funny, Working is what I'd recommend.\\n8/10\\nOverall:\\n8.8/10\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '295fa7ba87ed3b24251cd6120230c702'}>,\n",

In this case it follows the daily lives of several part time employees of a small restaurant.  Now if you haven\\'t seen Azumanga Daioh or School Rumble, having no plot may sound like a turn off, but the writers did a good job with character design where each one has their own personality and quirks.  With the anime centering around their daily lives at the restaurant it makes for\\na very enjoyable and entertaining workplace dynamic.\\nOn top of this, this anime is also a slight Romantic Comedy as some romance will develop between some of the characters through the course of the series.  One of the things I liked about this series is that its not a very heavy Rom Com where the emotional scenes aren\\'t very heavy and dramatic.  Its a Comedy first and a Rom Com/Drama second.  Not that I don\\'t like a healthy dose of drama and heavy feels and getting my heart ripped out when one of the characters gets their heart broken.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Wagnaria. Better known as Working!! was a very fresh intake on the slice of life field. It had great potential to be one of the best and unique SOLs out there but sadly later on that potential was severely wasted. Beneath the Moe and fun characters lay a sadly large amount of boring times as well.\\nStory: 7/10\\nI\\'d say it was good. It as mentioned before was a very unique take on the SOL genre as very few of them ever go beyond the walls of high school and this was about working (as if the name didn\\'t mention that :P). It started off really well\\nwith our \\'better than most other\\' MC Souta Takanashi joining the small but successful (?) restaurant Wagnaria. Throw in a bunch of complete wierdos and you\\'ve got your story. Being a SOL I didn\\'t expect much story and that\\'s exactly what happened. Inami\\'s androphobia was severely overused as a gag as well as a plot point and personally I grew fed up of it. At first it wasn\\'t that bad as it was mainly about Takanashi and Poplar but unfortunately the folks decided to make resident kickboxing chapion Inami the main focus. I\\'m perfectly fine with TsunDeres hitting boys from time to time don\\'t get me wrong, but for this anime as well as many others it was TOO MUCH. As I said before the story later on was a disappointing set of androphobic tropes which I got tired of. You here for the story? Enjoy the first few episodes then. Nothing beyond is good...\\nArt: 8/10\\nThe art was good I could say. Although a bit blurry at times (I watched it at 720p and yet it happened) and so a few scenes felt tired or washed out IYKWIM. Other than that the character design was great except for Inami. She somehow didn\\'t look good at all in almost all the scenes, perhaps because the folks didn\\'t know how to  ake her face seen good so they put blushes on her face THROUGH THE WHOLE DURATION OF THE ANIME. To think A-1 pictures made this...\\nSound: 8/10\\nA well chosen cast thankfully boosted the anime\\'s overall appeal in the sound category. The characters were well voiced and sounded perfect for their looks. Poplar and even Kyouko perfected the moe aspect of their characters and Takanashi\\'s voice fit well with his above average personality. The OP was terribly catchy and a joy to listen to while the ED was quite forgettable... Bonus points for that amazing OP though.\\nCharacter: 7/10\\nI was severely tempted to rate it an 8 but alas, why did A-1 pictures change the MC from Poplar to Inami I\\'ll never know, what I do know is it had a negative effect. Let\\'s start with our MC, Takanashi was thankfully a refreshing take as well on the megane wearing dense MC type in which he was at least one or two steps ahead of the other MCs of his type especially because there was a specific reason to what he did everytime... (Remembers disappointing last arc...) well ALMOST everytime. Moving on to Poplar, I felt bad for her mainly because the focus was taken away from a good character to a complete disgrace (looking at you Ms KickBoxer), Poplar was the Moe face of the anime and her personality as well was well done, made me say \"Sasuga Moe desho!\" as she wasn\\'t only a Moe piece of glass to be decorated, she had a sensible personality within her as well. Inami was a complete disgrace of a Tsundere, \\'nuff said. Her androphobia was enough to make me hate her completely throughout the anime. Satou... Satou was imo the best character of the whole anime. Period. He wasn\\'t dense, he wasn\\'t generic. He was the character you always wished for to be an MC. Yashiyo and Kyouko were great as well for comedic purposes but they didn\\'t serve much of a purpose and Yamada and Souma were ok as well. Only one character should have been killed off, and that is our unfortunate UFC champion.\\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\nNevertheless being a SOL it had it\\'s sweet and fun moments. Working was an anime that though story wise I dragged my tired and fed up self onward, comedy wise and SOL wise it was well done and I enjoyed that aspect of the anime. I came expecting a half decent story and well, I got what I wanted to no use complaining. It was different. And that\\'s what I wanted and expected the most. Which is the reason I rate it an 8.\\nOverall: 7.6\\nOverall, Working was a refreshing take on the SOL genre and it had great potential to be something better but sadly it reverted to a shadow of itself, and though it didn\\'t fall back hard, it certainly hurt it\\'s chances to be better received. I myself am shocked it rounded off to 8 as it certainly felt a 7 to me. And if a high rater like me thought it to be somewhere between 7-8 then God knows what the normal raters would rate. Sends me chills up my spine. In the end, Working is an anime that can be really enjoyed by those who are looking for an SOL that\\'s something different from most other anime in it\\'s genre. Definitely a fun anime to try out (if you have the time to try out new stuff!)\\nP.S: Once again, a boy takes the crown as best character, Satou best boy <3.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Contrary to what this anime portrays, working actually sucks. Especially at a restaurant where you are typically working with a bunch of people you  grow to hate, nothing is particularly cohesive because of the mutual hate of everyone, and you’re working so why the hell would you be happy? On top of that it’s hard to find a restaurant full of cute chicks, let alone a restaurant that will hire someone who is androphobic and a manager who eats the food supply. So Working!! is a complete work of fiction with absolutely no basis in reality. If it were to be realistic and a\\nfactual slice-of-life, it would have ended with the main character using his paycheck to buy some marijuana and light up behind the restaurant while he’s on breaks.\\nWorking!! is about Souta Takanashi, a guy who likes tiny things and, let’s face it, is probably a pedophile and a candidate for the sex offenders list when he turns eighteen. He gets recruited by the cute and tiny Poplar Taneshima to work at a family restaurant called Wagnaria, where only the weird are allowed to work. He only decides to work there because he appears to have a love for Poplar that transcends human comprehension. What appears to be the start of a love story between Souta and Poplar turns into MM! starring an androphobic girl who wants to cure her illness because she is falling in love with Souta. While this happens though Souta must take care of his crazy sisters who all seem to suffer from various symptoms of uselessness and that’s on top of working at the worst family restaurant in Japan. A family restaurant where your father has the potential to get beaten by an androphobic red-head, you are in fear of your life because of a long haired waitress who carries a katana, and if you don’t pay a tip you will more than likely get beaten up in a back alley because of the connections of an insane manager.\\nThe androphobia is something that gets turned into the focal point of the anime. At first it just seems to be a quirky little character driven adventure in a rather strange restaurant. But what it winds up being is an MM! style, “Let’s go on a date and cure your androphobia” based plot that isn’t all that exciting. This is not helped by the fact that the androphobic character, Mahiru Minami, isn’t a great character to watch and the plot never really progresses through her getting over her fear of men, it just seems to be there to kill time. Which is sad because there are a lot of great characters that could have been worked with and could have had a bigger role. I felt that the sudden change of focus from Poplar to Mahiru was too fast. I would have been fine with it if the series started with Mahiru and Souta meeting and the androphobia being there and the series telling me that that would be the focus. The fact that it didn’t and shifted direction halfway through was awkward.\\nOn top of that, the show seems to use the same jokes again and again and again. Mahiru’s tendency to punch men. Souta liking tiny things. Souta cross dressing. Poplar is short. The chef, Jun Satou, being in a one sided love with Yachiyo. Satou’s sister drinks a lot. The jokes don’t fall flat all the time, but seem a little overused. Which is why it is sad that the plot and the script couldn’t have been helped through more silly banter between the silly characters. If androphobia had  been nothing more than a side plot, the anime would have probably been a lot better. But the moment that became the main conflict, the anime suffered.\\nThe animation is pretty unexciting. The characters look okay, but the colors aren’t crisp and it all looks fairly dated.\\nThe sound is good. The theme song is pretty awesome and catchy. The end’s Japanese Elvis homage is pretty entertaining. Music during the show suits the mood and voice actors are good.\\nCharacters are a major part of what makes Working!! so good, and yet so average. Souta is your typical romantic/comedy/slice-of-life main male character, with the personality of a cardboard box. As does all main characters of the genre he has a particular complex that is exploited religiously and he overall never is real entertaining but for maybe two or three times.\\nPoplar is a clumsy, tiny seventeen year old who is adorable and funny. As stated previously, her shortness is continuously exploited by Jun, the badass chef who seems to be Sanji’s (One Piece) brother. Jun is in love with Yachiyo, who is in love with the manager, making things difficult. Yachiyo doesn’t have a lot of character, she is just the manager’s play thing, but the fact she carries around a katana and waits on people amused the hell out of me for no particular reason. I also found the one sided romance between Jun and her pretty cute. I just can’t get over how much Jun is like Sanji though. A chef. A blond. A chain smoker. I mean, come on…\\nAoi Yamada is a younger teen who joins the restaurant crew half-way through but doesn’t seem to be anything more than your clumsy little loli girl. She’s as useless as Mahiru,  another character who is flat and boring and yet is still the focus of the anime. And that’s the biggest problem of Working!! is focusing on the most boring characters.\\nAnd I also had a problem with the introduction of Maya Matsumoto on the last episode. She had been working at Wagnaria the whole series, yet doesn’t get a line until the end?\\nOverall, Working!! suffers from one problem, and that problem is Mahiru. If she weren’t the focus of the whole series, then it would be a pretty entertaining and all around fun little romp. But because the cool characters (Jun, Yachiyo, and the manager) aren’t focused on that much, the series loses a lot of points for me.\\nWorking!! is, nonetheless, not a bad way to spend a boring afternoon. It does have some entertaining characters and Wagnaria is a place you’ll look forward to returning to again and again with every episode. It’s just that shift in focus that really ruins it and leaves it unable to be considered great. It is instead, just average.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd9a5ea1a8716dbe39c15063811a9797b'}>,\n",

The ending is solid. The show is (currently) only offered in Japanese dub; the voice acting performances were solid.\\nAgain, the characters are really what drive the show.

For my and his surprise, I ended up liking it a lot, much more than him, who showed me the series.\\nAlthough it has not one of the greatest plots ever (actually, doesn\\'t even have a real, complex, totally continuous plot), the anime surprised me.

The comedy is i guess meh. If you have seen a couple of slice of life anime , You can expect the same from this anime. Although the anime has one problems - taking on plot threads that should not be in a light hearted anime.The anime takes on themes that are frankly not suitable for a slice of life anime. One of things about Slice\\nof life is that the unique and crazy charecters just exist as if\\nthey are normal beings. Their craziness is never shown to be something rare or something we need to dive into. The slice of life animes just give you a crazy charecter with their quirks and tells you to accept it. This anime does not do it and from there comes it's biggest problem , It tries to tell you WHY a charecter is like the way they are. Inami for example could have been a funny interesting charecter but the anime suddenly goes way too serious and shows how her father was a psychopath and traumatised her childhood. This trauma results in her androphobia. While this would work in more serious anime , In a comedy anime it does not work . It does not work because in a 12 episode anime it takes on subject that is needs at least 2 or 3 episodes to solve.\\nThis anime moves on quickly from that plot and the result ? a forced unfunny ending to the plot thread with the father getting a slap on the wrist at best.\\nThere is also the protagonists life.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"(this review contains spoilers)\\nAll right, so in this review, I’m going to use 3 key anime as references: Aria, Squid Girl, and Himouto Umaru-Chan. This is because these anime are somewhat similar to the anime I’ll be ranting, I mean reviewing. And I won’t be talking about the other couple seasons of the anime, since, well… I was never willing to watch them, and I’ll explain why later. Also if you're easily butthurt, don't read this…This review may or may not be seen as a rant.. All right, let’s just get to it, so I’ll be talking about Working, a standard, slice of life\\nanime that’s basically a dime a dozen. Now what is Working? Alright, buckle up, and listen closely to the plot that is Working… SO there’s this dude who gets invited to work at a local restaurant by one of his classmates, and so he does... That’s it. I’m not gonna trash the plot too much, since there are lots of anime with a similar plot, but a bit different, but that’s for later. Just looking at the first few minutes of the anime, I knew why it had such a high MyAnimeList ranking, it just screams basic Slice of Life. I’m not talking about the really sad, relatable, life appreciative or family type of slice of life, like Clannad, March Comes in Like a Lion, or Natsume’s book of friends. No, this is the kind of slice of life where it’s more just basic gags and stereotypical characters, which sometimes isn’t a bad thing, if done correctly. When I say stereotypical characters I mean this, let’s just look at the characters. We got a standard main character who looks as average as he is predictable, who also has an obsession for a specific character, speaking of, the one cute, chibi, girl who’s age is nothing like her height, yknow, for the lolicons. Next the cliche, maybe even shy tsundere who “hates” the MC or other male character, and eventually loves him, and finally the random reserved, always calm girl with a katana on her waist for no apparent reason (We’ll get to my dislike for her, later) There are other characters, but in my opinion, they’re either irrelevant, or I simply forgot their purpose. This is a standard high ranked Slice of Life anime cast that’s seen in a shit ton of other anime, like Umaru chan, Squid Girl, and Grand Blue (except Grand Blue is actually in the top 200) But what Working does wrong, is that it’s just too basic. For example, the MC is just some average dude with glasses, that’s it, but for let’s say, Umaru chan, the MC is a beautiful girl who is also an otaku weeb with a chibi look in her “otaku mode”. Or even squid girl, where the MC is well, a squid girl. And the other characters aren’t that memorable either. The one character that’s “unique” is the waitress with the katana on her waist, but for the first couple episodes it isn’t told why she has it, so I kind of let it slide. But when they do reveal why, It’s just stupid. She holds it because her family are swordsmiths…. Not because she’s some samurai, or even something as stupid as, “I like it”. No, she just so happens to be a part of a swordsmith family, which kind of has no purpose for her holding it. You don’t see a person who sells guns, hold an AK-47 with him while he’s going out to Burger King. But of course, it’s not only them, it’s also the tsundere. To me, she’s just there for the “romance” even though there basically isn’t any in the first season. She’s not like Taiga from Toradora, who just has a bad temper and beats people up for annoying her, or even Kaguya from Love Is War, who can’t show her love, because it’ll ruin her reputation. No, how about, she just punches men, because her daddy told her to. This would've worked if the anime was one of those surreal humours like Nichijou or Asobi Asobase, but it isn’t, it’s a legit “romance”, which is why it makes me dislike this anime. The anime is supposed to be a basic slice of life (almost too basic), but they try to put in romance to make it unique, but it fails. Case In point- The last episode. In the last episode, the employees go to some mall or city, and this is where tsundere girl is supposed to fess it up to the MC. Also, may I mention, that she finds out she loves him, because he dressed as a girl just so her dad wouldn't have a hissy fit with working with males? Or something dumb like that. But back on the last episode, in the beginning, the MC gets his clothes messy or lost or something, so he has to dress up as a girl, because there weren’t any male clothing shops around a mall are there? So that already makes the last episode flunk. But, at the very end, where the two are at a bench talking or some shit, when the girl is about to confess, A fucking dog bites her leg or something and the soda she had got them all messy, like, what? There are anime guilty of this like NHK or Aria the Origination where the love scene gets a wrench thrown at it, but the difference is, is that those scenes were interrupted by a plot, like, the other characters found them, or in NHK, the MC’s friend called about something important (which I won’t spoil) But this anime is like, nah bruh, let’s just have a dog, that has nothing to do with anything, break up the scene. So she never confesses, and they end up going back to the crew, or some shit like that.\\nTo be fair, looking at the rankings for the other seasons, she probably does eventually fess up, and they become lovey dovey, and the seasons get better and better, but the first season already screwed me off. A good example of a slice of life anime that does this, is Aria. In the first season of Aria, it was very similar to Working, 3 girls working at a gondola touring company in New Venice on Mars  (already a much better plot, in my opinion) I’ll admit the first season was okay, but what really wanted me to keep watching, was the music, the characters, and ultimately, the score. Aria 1st season is ranked in the 1000s on MAL, while the 3rd season drops it to the top 100, I believe it’s in the top 70. That’s a massive difference, I won’t get into the reason why it’s so good right now, but maybe later, since I’m kind of winging this review. But when you look at working, It's in the 1000s for the 1st season, but what about the final season? Working slowly but surely progresses to the top 280, definitely not as strong as Aria, especially because working has more seasons, while Aria was able to do it in just 3. So I stopped watching because not only the plot was bland, but the grand finale wouldn't be much of a satisfying ending, but to be fair, I am bias toward anime that are not in the top 200, especially because that’s when It becomes clear that I won’t like the anime as much as something low ranked like One Piece or HxH. Now as my final argument, I’m gonna continue with the blandness of the anime, especially in the plot (yes, we’re rolling back to the plot) The plot is just boring. They’re just… well, it’s in the title, WORKING, and doing it well! And this anime is like other basic Slice of Lifes where you can basically watch any episode without missing anything, since they’re their own little stories, think Aria, Umaru-chan or even higher ranked anime like Mushishi or Natsume. But what all those anime have different, is the plot. Yes, it's a basic slice of life, but let's look at squid girls, and umaru chan, which are ranked even higher than working. In Squid Girl, the MC is forced to work at a beach restaurant due to her trying to “invade” the store to revolt against humanity for putting plastic in the ocean. Already sounds more of a better way to start a story than just applying for a job. ANd the story progresses with scientists who want to inspect and research Squid Girl, and even portrays the life of living by the coast. But maybe squid girl is too supernatural? Alright, let's look at Umaru Chan. A beautiful girl, who when she’s at home is a lazy, shut in, who relies on her brother for everything, and in the second season, it revolves more around her and her friends having fun. But what makes that “fun” interesting, is that as the story progresses, the story becomes more about the bliss of being young, growing up, hanging out with friends, and even remembering the times when you were a kid, going to that one store, that is now closed. An equally simpler plot, but done better than working. And finally, Aria, as a bonus. As I said the plot revolves around 3 girls working at Gondola Touring companies on Mars, honestly, I thought Aria would be boring as hell, but then you get into why it’s so great, for such a simple plot. The girls experience and find man made miracles, why life is so great, watching the characters grow and ultimately the anime makes you see the world differently, especially because them being on Mars has little to nothing about the plot. And not to mention the music matches the setting perfectly, It’s calming, soothing, and fits the Venecian atmosphere. There are no villains, no sad endings (maybe the 3rd season though) Just girls training to become Gondola tourist drivers. Which is perfectly what Working lacks, the plot is basic to the brim, the music is standard slice of life, royalty free. And the romance that was pushed, just flopped, and nothing that I said about any of the 3 anime I compared it to, Working had, it was just a basic slice of life, so basic, that it’s too basic,and it’s just bland. For a TLDR, i'll put it like this, from 1-10, 10 being perfect, and 1 being appalling, Workings characters are 4, plot is 4, resolution is 3, and the humour (since it is a basic slice of life comedy) is a 6. The anime is so basic, that it doesn’t even get terribly bad scores, just, plain bad. If you are thinking of a standard slice of life anime that you want to watch, where episodes are basically unconnected, I’d skip working, and watch Non Non Biyori, Aria, or Grand Blue, but if you still want romance, watch Umaru chan 2nd season, Love is War, or even Toradora ( Aria 3rd season may also work for subtle romance). And if you want a basic slice of life that’s actually good at comedy, watch Asobi Asobase, GTO, or even Lucky Star. In my opinion, It was better than working, by a mile, in comedy, romance and resolution, and that’s saying something, Anyway that’s my review and I’m sticking to it, shows over.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '39d02891830977828a5fa8c95457779e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Poor writing. Poor animation. Poor script. Bad cast. This is really really mediocre.\\nMeta humor is fun when it is used carefully and infrequently. You cannot base an anime around 2-3 main plot points and call it a day. Working!! is a poor example of what happens when everything a show offers can be seen in the first 2 episodes. This is a common problem in a lot of anime so audience for these shows are somewhat used to it me included however for some reason I could not overlook this show. One of the girls has an androphobia which causes her to attack every male\\nshe comes close to. Nothing original there however passable. Anyway, so she interacts with our main guy and slowly gets used to him punching him countless times along the way. For the first 10 times I watched the 10 second clip of Inami punching Souta however the next 90 times was too much. And I am writing this review as I stopped the 3 episode of the second fcking season. That shit still happens frequently. There are 2 more similar story points in this anime where there is a completely dull character with a one fucking single gimmick\\nrepeating that shit over and over again. It gets boring fast and annoying even faster. Think about the times where you got sick of tsundere character using her weapon, magic, punch etc. on any bland MC in any of the standard harem trash over and over again. Same thing here.\\nEnsemble casts are pretty much standard if you are making an episodic comedy. However characters need to be interesting for it to work. Gintama has tons of interesting characters and constantly switch them around on episodic basis. Community has 7 characters and every one of them is interesting. Working!! literally has 8 or so characters and every single one of them is in every episode. Out of those 8 combine all of them and you get 2 or maybe 3 fully realized characters max because they are extremely one dimensional. Most of them has a single gimmick. Aside from Yamada, every other character is extremely predictable. And Yamada is unpredictable because she does not make any sense from the start. Her randomness leaves me a bit conflicted because she is not a complex character but rather a character with randomness as her gimmick.\\nOverall, it is boring as hell and looks like it will get even worse from here.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9727cd9fa5a3d726572af9d7c25780de'}>,\n",

What they pass off as comedy in this anime is women hitting men, whether they are coworkers, customers or their own brother, interjected by a few short person equals kid jokes. Except perhaps the mc, the motivations of characters are very unclear as to why they stay together. Theres absolutely nil chemistry between the characters, most of them driven by some ridiculous motivations to do anything. Inami\\'s androphobia started due to the lamest reasons, and it being the major plot point of the show,\\na bit more work could have been put into developing that. Instead they just want to use it as an excuse for her to hit the MC and hope people laugh. It was pretty annoying to watch.\\nHowever its a decent romance story and its definitely feel-good. Most of the characters seem very happy doing whatever stupid things they do and that kind of shit cheered me up quite a few times. The inclusivity of every weirdness gave out a good vibe. Yamada was a necessary character for progressing the \"love story\" and I appreciated how she was added to the cast as a mysterious character. However it does not seem that the show will make any progress with the story lines in the next seasons, else there wont be any \"comedic element\" left.\\nStory : 6/10. There are a few romance plot points, concerning only some of the characters. It was just fine. Wanted it to be a comedy but it wasnt. Pacing of each arc was good though, one would enjoy while the arc is happening but would be left with a bad taste after.\\nArt : 6/10. Not the best animation, but not the worst. Some of the emoting of the characters was done well, hence I scored it higher than I might have.\\nSound : 7/10. The music and the VA were done really well in my opinion and some of the background sounds told us more about the characters than the lazy dialogues. Some even managed to make me smile.\\nCharacter : 3/10 Except the MC there\\'s not one flushed out character, or even likeable for that matter. It felt like the MC was thrown into a pot of strangers doing eccentric stuff around him, I could not feel a connection to any of the other characters. If people might think one cant expect much characterization in comedies, they just havent watched great comedies like Grand Blue and BakaTest, which have eccentric groups, but with great interactions and synergy.\\nEnjoyment : 7/10 Perhaps the parameter to which I put the greatest weight to.

       "  <Document: {'content': '[Possible spoilers ahead! Skip below for TLDR version!]\\nAs someone who thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons I was strongly anticipating the continuation of the YowaPeda series. And while the first two installments of it were solid sport series, this one disappointed me greatly and had me wondering what the author was actually thinking most of the time.\\nSTORY: The story starts at the point the 3rd years leave the club after the Inter Highs due to exams and skips to the beginning of the 2nd year for Onoda and his friends. This is the point where the first season already had it\\'s major flaws: The story\\ntakes way too much time to start and keeps itself busy with character introductions and training. Oh and overly dramatic speeches of course.\\nAlso another thing that bothered me was how everything keeps repeating itself. They have the beginners race, the training camp with the 1000 km race and so on which was very tiring indeed. The writer could\\'ve come up with something fresh/new instead of reusing the same plot-line.\\nBut what disappointed me the most was that the aim of the team is still the same. Of course it\\'s logical that they\\'d want to win the Inter Highs again but it took me 18 episodes to realize that all the hype around it was away. I didn\\'t even care for them winning a second time because they already won it and that\\'s it. Could\\'ve introduced another kind of tournament or maybe even an international one...but nope \"InHi\" again I guess. And with the same line-up. Yes, there NO new teams. They\\'re still up against Hakone and KyoFushi (and some fodder schools but they aren\\'t worth mentioning).\\nCHARACTERS: Here is where the show usually shined, but paled this season. First of all, our Senpais are away and will be missed for sure. But of course I hoped for some cool, new characters. What did we get instead? Bratty first years, copycats of prior third years and unnecessary character additions for plot convenience.\\nThe team of six is completed by a guy named Kaburagi Issa who is pretty much a more obnoxious version of Naruko. He\\'s an arrogant, childish and rude teenager whose purpose is not quite clear to me. The narrative wants us to think he\\'s the \"perfect\" sprinter (while he wants to be an all-rounder). Why not introduce a type of character we didn\\'t have yet instead? Why the fk does he look like Naruko?\\nAlso we have our main characters, which didn\\'t change much except that they\\'re a bit more mature. Naruko gets some kind of development, while Imaizumi is irrelevant most of the time. Oh and Onoda tries to be Makishima 2.0 while he fails at it. Sugimoto showed some potential, but was cut off sadly. I was rooting for him actually...\\nThen at the training camp some guy who apparently everyone knows except for the viewer appears and challenges Teshima to a ride which shall decide who will be the captain. And ofc EVERYONE is ok with that. I mean dude, who are you even? Why is no one bothered by him? He was literally added just to give Teshima a justification for being captain and that\\'s it.\\nThe idea of giving Teshima some spotlight was good though, as well as Aoyagi. I enjoyed their scenes mostly. I liked how Teshima said \"I\\'m weak\" as opposed to the infamous \"I\\'m strong\" of Hakone\\'s Fukutomi. But it could\\'ve been handled better.\\nBut the worst thing was how they handled Midousuji. After the second day race and his \"trip\" with Onoda I thought he was inspired by him and changed a little concerning his attidue towards his team. However this season completely omitted that and made him even more evil and weird. He got some battle shounen-esque transformations where he literally evolves to a butterfly or something. And he has a gay-ass massage guy as assistant who likes touching people. Oh and of course he has his Zaku-army.\\nHakone\\'s new members are pretty disappointing too. Kuroda is too much of an Arakita try-hard, Shinkai\\'s brother is literally Shinkai and the big guy was not terrible but also nothing special. Oh and there\\'s a tall guy who likes Beethoven.\\nMUSIC/ART: The music was excellent as always and we also got a new Hime song. The animation was good although there was awkward CGI at times.\\nOVERALL: While it was not utterly terrible I was overly disappointed by the new seasons repetitiveness. It had absolutely nothing new to offer and recycled old formulas from season one instead. The new characters were not refreshing nor had anything interesting to them.\\nTL;DR:\\n+ Music/Art is good as always, although animation is not perfect\\n+ More spotlight/development for Teshima and Aoyagi\\n- no new plotline, recycles old elements\\n- not as exciting as season one, lacks some new goals/teams/reason for competition\\n- takes much time to start with the tournament\\n- characterization is weak, new characters are uninteresting', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b696c357f9e16ed3860ca77fd6282f44'}>,\n",

Personally, I missed \"I am strong\" thing of Hakone\\'s ace.\\nSure, it\\'s sad. But, life continues on. The next Interhigh gonna come soon. Time to prepare for Hakone\\'s revenge. And that\\'s what they do. But not only them. Kyoto Fushimi and Hakone hone their skills too.

Everyone wants to achieve something, everyone has a pride to keep on. To keep on doing things they decide to do.\\nI think this variety of characters makes it possible to find the character with whom a viewer could sympathy with. In my case, I found this one.

Still, there\\'s Hakone which is unstoppable. Still Midousuji... So, you\\'ve got the gist.\\nIf you had liked previous seasons there\\'s 85% you would like this one as well.\\nMaybe you won\\'t because, to be honest, it starts to be a little self-repetitive.

I\\'m giving it a 7 for one major scenarist plothole:\\nSPOILER\\nWe have a new third year who we never saw - Or at least I don\\'t remember his existence in the first two seasons - who challenges Teshima for his position as a captain. In spite of being way stronger than new first year Kaburagi Issa, he is strangely not taken as a regular in the team... with no explanation whatsoever. Why such a strong character finishes his 1000 km AFTER Kaburagi in spite of having challenged Teshima and being obviously stronger is not explained and not logical. I don\\'t know if the manga gives a better explanation but given the fact that Kaburagi is a pain in the a**, it would have been nice to give us a proper explanation as to why we have to suffer his presence over Koga\\'s.\\nEND OF SPOILER\\nYou might have expected that Sohoku would be the stars of the shows, but nope, still Hakone are the favorites. Last year was about team Sohoku, made up of prodigies and hidden gems... This season is all about weak characters transcending themselves. Aoyagi, Teshima and Sugimoto are the ones who make this season shines.\\nArt: 8\\nAs good as the previous season... Though I\\'m not a huge fan of some new haircuts and whatnot. There are so many characters in this series, they\\'re already difficult to remember, so why the new haircuts guys? Especially since most of these characters are not a pretty sight.\\nSound: 7\\nFamiliar themes are back. Never been a fan of the openings and endings. Good music... but frankly you could use it on any sport anime ever that I would not know they come from Yowamushi Pedal originally.\\nCharacter: 8\\nMinus 2 for Kaburagi Issa who is not the most... endearing first year. His arrogance is through the roof and frankly he\\'s not likable at all. Naruko was an idiot in the first two seasons, but he has a shred of modesty and respect that made his ridiculous antics funny rather than irritating... Unfortunately not Kaburagi... And we do get a lot of Kaburagi... unfortunately. Well we\\'ll see how he fares in the 4th season but let\\'s just say that thankfully we have other characters who were so endearing in this season that they counterbalanced this idiot.\\nAs written previously, though we get a lot of Naruko and a bit of Sakamichi at the beginning of this third season, the focus is mostly on Teshima, Aoyagi and Show-off aka Kaburagi.\\nSugimoto also has an opportunity to shine in this season. Basically, Overall, Sohoku is globally made of weaker members.\\nTeshima and Aoyagi in particular have nothing going for themselves physically and seeing them overcome their own physical limits while struggling under the weight of their responsibility as president and vice president is inspiring.\\nYou can\\'t help but root for them and wish just for once, that a true underdog, without anything special is gonna make it.\\nEnjoyment: 9\\nExcluding Kaburagi, who doesn\\'t deserve this team at the time I\\'m typing this, I loved this season almost as much as the previous one. It has a LOT to do with Teshima being captain. Most often in anime or manga, weak characters always have that special something that ultimately turns things around. They might have stacks of odds against them, but they do have something going for them even if that something is tiny.\\nTeshima and Aoyagi... have absolutely nothing except the fact that they\\'re considered ordinary and that they\\'ve always experienced failures after failures. Resilience and the ability to keep going, to support others and make them shine brighter without jealousy and envy is not something often portrayed in animes. Yet it\\'s done here, wonderfully, and I couldn\\'t help but relate to these guys.\\nYes the suspense is on... because Sohoku is definitely not the favorite this year either... But as Teshima said, \"Defeat is the first step to victory.\"\\nOverall: 8\\nGreat season though I guess the drop in ratings on MAL is because the focus shifts from our main characters. The season finishes at the end of the 1st day\\'s climb of the inter-high so it\\'s very likely we\\'ll see more of them in the next season.

These shown problems are usually not dealt or tried to be solved with it, but by the characters themselves.\\nIn addition some quite serious and, considering the audience of this franchise, surprisingly mature problems are dealt with in this series.\\nThe series is surpsingly realistic in showing and dealing with these problems and I really like how magic is not a direct part of solving these troubles. The series is at its core very mature, but still presents the topics in a manner, very suitable for children. There is quite some educational value inside of it.\\nDespite its age it doesn\\'t really look dated. Due to its parent series, it\\'s still quite trimmend on \"cute\" and very colourful, although, it appears to me, not quite as much as in the parent story.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e9aca5209ba16b8b04d0abe9bdac3d1b'}>,\n",

It's hard-pressed to find an anime like Seikai no Monshou, with its same blend of both serious and entertaining drama and dialogue, and its very intense space battle action scenes.\\nSeikai no Monshou has a story that was both pure in its innocence and compelling in\\nits complexity, featuring a not-so-simple delving into the politics of humankind and interstellar relations, as well as the genetically-enhanced race of the Abh, something just as interesting in its own right.

It's not something that I would entirely dock many points off for. Too, the cinematography and interesting angles used to portray the story would also help buoy this particular area up. The sound too was fairly &quot;old&quot;, but still managed to fit with the show quite well; the voices, on the other hand, were done magnificently (in the subbed version, definitely not the dubbed).\\nThe characters in this show, while not completely original, did progress and were developed well, the main two characters and their relationship even more entertaining to watch and feel how well they manage to grow into each other and balance each other out so nicely. They definitely did not feel flat, which I always hate.\\nOverall, this show is one I recommend to anyone who'd like to watch an intellectual sci-fi space show (with no mechas) that brings together politics and drama well enough to both entertain your adrenalin and give some practice for your brain.

       "  <Document: {'content': '*This review contains spoilers\\nA rating of 1/10 is way too low to be left unjustifed and that is why I wrote this review.\\nOne of the oldest tricks in the trade is to create an overly intricate setting to try and mask the bias and deceit in an artwork. In my opinion, Seikai no Monshou does this and worse. I will try to explain why I came to this conclusion and I hope to do so in a way that will not seem offensive to anyone.\\nStory: 1/10\\n\"Crest of the Stars\" takes place in an imaginary future where a race, formerly engineered by humans, has created a\\nfeudal empire which has become the greatest force in the galaxy. Opposing this empire are different human groups whose leaders are elected democratically. The Abhs are the genetically modified humans who rule the afore mentionned empire and the show focuses on a young human called Ghintec as he is escorted by the Abh princess Lamhirh. The story basically revolves around this duo and the evolution of their relationship as they are caught in a galactic war between the Empire and an alliance of democratic groups. I believe I can say this much without spoiling the show.\\nThroughout the 13 episodes, we see the Abhs portrayed as galant, prideful and beautiful beings (well people seem to think they are in the show) who are both impulsive and martial but also reasonable and compassionate (yes, it seems the author doesn\\'t realise that the former are the opposite of the latter). We learn about their reproductive habits : basically they can reproduce with just about anything in any way imaginable. We also learn about their strength and their longevity: they are very long-lived and almost eternally young - yes, pretty creepy when your progenitor - can\\'t really say parent - looks as young as you. Finally, we are told of their social structure which, on a private level, is just about non-existent and on a national level is exactly that of any monarchy of our past. We also learn that their violent campaign of colonization of the galaxy is justifed by saying that it is for the good of humankind and that it is carried out with the intention of bringing peace and development. That will sound familiar to any history students as basically all former colonial empires have justified the horror of their actions in that same way. The only (willingly) negative portrait of an Abh, is that of a noble from a recently created barony who basically loathes humans because his father was one and suffers from an inferiority complex. It really seems as if the author showed him to convince us that he wasn\\'t completely partial but it\\'s the exact opposite that transpires. He doesn\\'t criticize in any way the Abhs or their society but only tries to convince us that only pure Abhs can make it work and that lowly humans can tag along as long they admiringly obey every command.\\nThe democratic alliance on the other hand is portrayed as a rag-tag team of envious and imperfect (meaning normal humans) beings who stage an attack to create a conflict. All members of this alliance are shown as rather ugly people both of mind and body (one of the ambassadors actually has a scar and eyepatch...). Their reasons for going to war against the colonial empire ruled by another species are shown to be greed, cowardice and envy. Their words are shown as being those of hypocrites and all their speeches and annoucements sound like propaganda. The author tries to convince us that only despicable beings can fight against a colonial empire that plans to rule by destroying all existing social structures and imposing its culture and values and denying the human race its basic right to have a voice in the organisation of society.\\nThroughout the show, humans of the democratic alliance are portrayed in a very unflattering manner and the main protagonists are put into situations that further imply the \"greatness\" of the Abhs and the inferiority of the humans. The pure Abhs are never made to look bad and all their strange behaviors are passed off as the delightful quirks of rightful lords and ladies. The author went so far as to create a new language for this race in what seems like an obvious attempt to make this show seem awe-inspiring in its form so people would accept the content more easily. Indeed, a person is likely to be astonished by the effort taken to create such a detailed fictional world and not realise that it was done to push through some very twisted ideas and concepts.\\nIt seems obvious to me that the author is a nostalgic of imperialism and this imaginary galaxy and its imaginary genetically superior race was his way of trying to make something so fundamentaly wrong as a feudal and colonial system seem to work just fine. Unlike in shows like \"Legend of the Galactic Heroes\", there is no debate here, only a mockery of one. Had the Abhs really existed, this anime would have made great propaganda for them. Furthermore, the fact that the Abhs are a GENETICALLY superior race of rulers reminds one of rather unpleasant memories of the past...\\nCharacters: 3/10\\nThe work on these was rather pitiful in my opinion but still very much in accord with the purpose of the show. All Abhs (except for a black sheep) are grand beings and all humans are either dying of envy and hatred or are in unabashed admiration before the greatness of the Abhs... Ghintec would be one of the admiring ones. Lamhirh is a typical member of the ruling class of a colonial empire, sure of the righteousness of her purpose and unquestioning of the principles that govern her life.\\nArt: 5/10\\nI cannot comment on the animation as I have too little knowledge to do so. I very much disliked the art of the show. The exaggerated ugliness of the \"inferior\" humans was pretty annoying. The Abhs looked pretty freakish to me but I think it quite possible that perveted humans might create such beings to serve them.\\nSound: 5/10\\nCan\\'t really says much about it except it didn\\'t strike me in any way. I don\\'t have much knowledge of music and the show was so annoying to me, no music could have salvaged it.\\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\nI have rarely ever been so annoyed by a show as this one. All that it tried to convey was in complete opposition to the values and principles I care for and defend.\\nOverall: 1/10\\nOne of the things I appreciate most in any work of art, even if the opinions conveyed are not ones I share, is honesty. To me \"Seikai no Monshou\" is a very dishonest work.\\nI believe that if you like intricately designed imaginary worlds then you might like this show. I also believe that if you value human freedom and the right to democratically elect your representatives and leaders, if you hate propaganda and dishonesty, if you hate being taken for a fool or when someone tries to fool you then you probably should not watch this anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b949b29f5d374180c32cedf647d65cff'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Crest of the Stars is an odd anime. It\\'s a grand scale Space Opera like Galactic Heroes, but it\\'s very unique at the same time. It\\'s famous, and in some circles infamous, for being the most elitist anime EVER made. Having watched Banner of the Stars and about 900 other anime, I can confirm this is likely true.\\nThe word \"elitism\" gets tossed around MAL a lot. Anyone who thinks Evangelion and Texhnolyze are better than Angel Beats and Bleach gets called an \"elitist\" and soon self identifies that way. What actually is elitism?\\nDefinition: Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite—a\\nselect group of people with a certain ancestry, intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience—are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others.\\nThe vast majority of shows and directors who are called \"elitist\" don\\'t fit the bill. Hideaki Anno is an otaku who loves Cutey Honey, suffers from depression, and takes an interest in human psychology. He isn\\'t an elitist and his shows aren\\'t elitist. Mamoru Oshii is a socialist, so that immediately rules him out. Masaki Yuasa is playful and eccentric, but hardly an elitist. If Galactic Heroes were truly an elitist series, Yang would be the villain and Rudolph von Goldenbaum would be portrayed as the hero. This of course is not the case.\\nSo how does Banner of the Stars win this title? Banner is pro-colonialist, political diatribe set in space that tries to use Nietzsche\\'s \"On the Genealogy of Morals\" to prove that superior races should rule over inferior ones. Hoo boy!\\nIn the future, humans use genetic engineering to create a master race of elves. The elves are more intelligent than humans, stronger, more beautiful, create better art, and create their own morality based on their superior Will to Power. The elves disdain democracy as a product of inferior peoples trying to drag down the strong, and the anime goes WAY out of its way to say the elves are 100% correct. While Galactic Heroes wishes to show the flaws and benefits of different government types, Banner of the Stars just wants to shove its message right down your throat.\\nThe Elves believe it would benefit the humans to be ruled over as slaves, which is a point our main human character agrees with! The only humans that oppose the elves are simply jealous and \"butthurt\" that the elves are so much better than them. The humans suffer from a \"Slave Morality\" which is based on weakness, resentfulness, and jealousy. The Elves judge good or evil by the result. They create their own values. The humans judge good and evil by intent and irrational emotions. The humans call the conquering elves \"evil\", merely because the elves being superior hurts their fee fees. The Slave Morality doesn\\'t seek to create value, merely to drag down the superior to their level. In essence, anything the Masters stand for becomes \"evil\".\\nWhile this series is certainly bold and shocking, I don\\'t feel it adds anything of value to anime. It\\'s a very simplistic, teenage surface reading of Nietzsche to push a frankly disgusting political agenda. The characters are as interesting as cardboard cut outs, and the animation is just meh. The production values are the only reason I didn\\'t give this a 1. I\\'m a very fair critic.\\nBanner of the Stars is basically what would happen if Legend of the Galactic Heroes was written by William Luther Pierce...and then was boring as fuck on top of it. At least the script writer went on to write Witch Hunter Robin...which is just boring. At least Robin wasn\\'t stomach churning, cringey, AND boring. The director hasn\\'t worked on much else, but at least he went on to direct Shin Cutie Honey, the 90s reboot with the massive tits.\\nIf you\\'re interested in subversive art, I guess you could give this a try. On a technical scale it isn\\'t that bad, because Sunrise agreed to make it for some unknown reason. How the hell do I end a review of the farthest right anime ever made? Well...I guess I could bring out the dead memes.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Overview: Crest of the Stars is by far one of my all time favorite anime.  That said it is not for everyone.  The show is set far into the future were humans have colonized the entire galaxy.  The two main characters Jinto and Lafiel are well developed and entertaining to watch.  If there is a down side to this show it is that it is rather slow paced, and involves a great deal of dialog.  Although there are action scenes in the show, this is not for people with short attention spans.\\nStory: There are two stories taking place in crest\\nof the stars, both of which are connected and continue into the squeals.  The first story is that of Jinto and Lafiel, without giving to much away, suffice to say that a good deal of the show focuses on there journey as they are tossed around by the events around them.  The second story is that of galactic politics.  Both stories are well told, and they intertwine throughout the show.\\nArt: Although it is a bit dated by todays standards the visuals are still as stunning as when i first saw the show several years ago.  This is a prime example of aged excellence.\\nSound: Crest of the stars simply would not be as good a show if not for the amazing orchestra in the background.  The opening theme song does get old after a while, but the music during the show is some of the best iv herd in an anime.  This is not to say the music in and of itself is superb, but rather the fusion of art, sound and context of what is happening on screen at the moment is masterfully executed. (But the music is the strongest part hear because it invokes powerful emotion in various parts).\\nCharecters: All of the characters in crest of the stars are well portrayed and developed.  The show even hints at cast members back ground just to give you more feel for the world.  Also Jino and Lafiel are two of my favorite characters out of any anime.\\nEnjoyment:  The reason why enjoyment is lower than the other areas is simply because crest of the stars is a slow anime.  It can in certain places drag on a bit, when a more modern adaptation would be paced a bit quicker.  Despite this all of the other elements that make up the show more than compensate for it.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Crest of the Stars is a show that starts off with such great artistic promise, and such effortless mastery of the art of storytelling, that it might seem downright insane of me (or anyone, for that matter) to ultimately award it a score of 1. The problem then, is that it presents a distorted  picture of its own premise, and it isn\\'t until close to the very end that it reveals itself to be something that\\'s shockingly nasty and horrifying, and in a way that makes its artistic accomplishments come across in extremely horrible taste. And till then, it comes across as an especially\\ncharming and thoughtful show, carrying you along for a rather fascinating ride through its strange and curious world. But as I now intend to explain, it is this very \"journey\" that is a misdirection, and one carried out in unbelievably bad faith.\\nThe show introduces a very intriguing concept - a race of genetically modified space-faring humans called the Abh, who are long-lived, youthful-looking and generally confine themselves to space colonies rather than live on terrestrial planets. These Abh have advanced far ahead of ordinary humans by utilising their genetic modification technology and the freedom of their space habitats to create a population of humans who are superbly adapted to even the most challenging conditions in space, and virtually never age until very late into their lifespans. Their society is also unbelievably permissive, where they can breed with just about anyone with the help of artificial wombs.\\nOn the other hand, they are shown to be territorially aggressive, invading terrestrial planets where the regular humans (called Terrans in the show) live, and claiming them as territories of their Empire. They don\\'t even want to live there (they seem to prefer their Space habitats), but they nevertheless exert their authority over the planets, going to the trouble of toppling the existing governments in place and appointing Terran puppet figureheads to rule on their behalf. This much is verifiable fact. This is also the premise around which the show revolves - just who are the Abh really, and why do they act this way? To demonstrate where they go with this premise (and ultimately get to WHY I\\'m denouncing this show in such strong terms), I\\'ll need to give at least a general outline of the plot, but I\\'ll try and describe only the broadest strokes, without giving away any spoilers:\\nIn the beginning, the show focuses on the atmosphere of political upheaval caused by the Abh invasion and takeover of governance in a planet called Martine. Subsequently, we get to see the effects of this change on the fate of a young boy (our protagonist, Lin Jinto) caught in the middle of all this, an unwitting pawn in the game. Due to various events, he is thrust into a position of civil service, and is awaiting transfer to Abh country for further education and training. Here he meets our other lead, Lafiel Abriel - an Abh cadet assigned to escort him - and they develop a spontaneous but believable cameraderie and friendship. The stage then shifts to the inside of the Abh spaceship transporting them, where Jinto gets to meet the Abh in person for the first time, and through his interactions the audience gets to learn of their strange and curious ways. It\\'s full of interesting little details that add a sense of charm to the whole thing.\\nThen, the ship they are travelling in is put in danger, and the focus shifts to the immediacy of the situation - how our leads are going to survive and reach their destination to carry out their duty. This setup makes for some genuinely gripping adventure, that carries this show into about three-quarters of its 13-episode length. The scenes are genuinely tense and suspenseful, and you really don\\'t know what to expect next. And through all of this, you have gradually come to care for the two leads. They seemed really likeable to begin with, they are put through all sorts of danger, and then really come through for each other in ways that you can\\'t help but be moved by. And so you find yourself caring about what happens to them when they finally reach their destination...\\nAnd it\\'s here that the show delivers its killing blow: the trials and tribulations of our young heroes are ultimately relvealed to be nothing more than convenient plot devices to showcase the baseness and cruelty of the Terrans opposed to Abh rule. They are shown to be deeply envious of the eternally youthful and long-lived Abh race, and want to subject them to their own dominion and make them their slaves (I swear I\\'m not making this up). Any humans who are less than enthusiastic to the idea of Abh dominion are portrayed as grotesque caricatures of spite, envy, prejudice, greed, selfishness and cruelty, and even their visual portrayal looks obnoxiously cartoonish and ugly. And the Abhs, in contrast, are made to come off as larger-than-life beings who could do no wrong (unless of course they have half-human ancestry...), and they are accordingly animated to look stately and elegant, with their elf-like features, blue hair and proud but noble bearing. The show goes out of its way at every turn to illustrate how impeccable the Abh are in their character, and how even do-gooder humans are inwardly driven by rather unflattering motivations.\\nIn short, it becomes increasingly clear that all these exaggerated portrayals were in the show\\'s way of justifying the Abh\\'s entirely unprovoked aggression on humans - some of whom weren\\'t even aware of their existence, let alone be on hostile terms with them - all the while shifting your attention to the immediate danger facing the two leads. And consequently, you realize with shock and horror that all those seemingly nasty and unfounded things the Abh-haters said about them earlier on...were actually true. There is one scene in particular early on, where an old woman is overcome with an inexplicably hysteric reaction of sheer loathing and even dread, just at the mere sight of an Abh. In the context of the show\\'s later developments, this reaction suddenly makes a frightening amount of sense (just imagine how it must feel knowing that the very same overlords you\\'ve known and loathed since your childhood are still young and strong, and will very likely outlive not only you but your children and grandchildren as well). And in the face of this, the show insists that the Abh are humanity\\'s only real hope - on one hand, it tries to pass off all their horrifying actions as extremely smart moves that are beyond the understanding or appreciation of lowly mortals; and on the other, it tries to suggest that their enemies are actually driven only by bitter jealousy of the Abh\\'s apparent \"greatness\" and superiority.\\nAn important device for furthering this illusion is the show\\'s own narrator, who speaks in Abh-language with an air of lofty detachment. At various points throughout the show, he plays the role of providing historical context to whatever is being depicted on-screen. But as the show progresses, he starts inserting one sneaky insinuation after another into his narration; until by the end, he is quite explicitly showering unconditional praise on everything Abh, and utter contempt for all Terran institutions. The show also executes another crafty sleight-of-hand to maintain the audience\\'s sympathy towards its protagonist - through the course of the 13 episodes, it subtly shifts from portraying Jinto as an unwilling hostage of the Abh system, to a regular Earthling helping a stranded Abh out of ordinary decency, to an outright Abh sympathiser who implicitly approves of all the atrocities they would commit in the name of a \"wronged\" people, to a full-fledged member of a nobility that is subjugating his own home planet. And in the end, the show would have you believe that it was the humans (including his father, among others), rather than the Abh, who were the cause of his misery and hardship.\\nAnd then there\\'s the Abh themselves - initially portrayed as romantic star-faring gypsies dragged into a war they didn\\'t want (\"Kin of the Stars\" is what the show poetically calls them), they are subsequently shown to be brave, chivalrous and decisive when pushed into battle...until somewhere along the line you realize that all the Abh you get to see are in fact soldiers in some or the other capacity, and their entire society is in fact organised along militaristic lines. The show has an enigmatic and bombastic prologue scene depicting the Abh fiercely engaged in what appears to be an epic and heroic battle for their lives - but all they were actually doing was destroying the defences of an unwary and ill-equipped planet that barely even knew of the Abh\\'s existence. Quite the heroes, these guys...\\nNow let\\'s just say that none of this really matters to you, and all you want to know is if this is an enjoyable show on the simple level of an adventure story, or perhaps a romance. Whatever the angle with which you may initially have approached the show - be it sci-fi, politics, drama, romance, or whatever else - in the end you\\'ll find that your hand closes in on empty air. Why do I say this? Because when you get to the last couple of episodes, all the show\\'s initial promise of thematic exploration and character development is crudely cast aside, because it\\'s time to push their ultimate aganda. You can see this for yourself - the plot regresses into something jaw-droppingly preposterous (that is, until the conclusion, when the intent becomes sickeningly clear), and the characters are reduced to being zombie mouthpieces for the author\\'s ideology. The transformation is quite shocking and hard to miss, and it\\'s at this point that you\\'re suddenly snapped awake, and suddenly become aware of the underlying immorality of the whole thing.\\nOn a technical level, the show is extremely accomplished at evoking just the right kind of mood and ambience. The visuals are low-key and present an air of nocturnal tranquility, both in the surface worlds and in space (though in the later episodes it goes for the opposite effect). The music is equally serene, and has a distantly operatic feel. But that\\'s precisely what makes the experience so jarring when you get to those last few episodes - the disconnect between the horror that\\'s being shown on screen, and the way the show expects you to feel about it, induces a feeling of disorientation and nausea even at a basic sensory level. It\\'s not an experience I\\'d recommend, to say the least.\\nAs for the characters - Jinto initially comes across as an innocent and unwilling pawn in a game that he had no control over, but in the end you get to see his fawning admiration and sycophancy towards the Abh, to the point that he counts himself as one of them, and overlooks the fact that they are in fact invaders and unlawful rulers of his homeworld (I can only guess he will end up fathering another patricidal Abh in his own turn...) Likewise, Lafiel also initially comes off in a similarly sympathetic light as someone who is grateful to someone who saw her for the individual she was rather than for her status in Abh society, but by the end you see another side to her - a blindly self-righteous aristocrat who notes how her people were wronged in the past, but thinks nothing of the atrocities and injustices that her own people are committing on innocent populations. Ultimately, her purpose in the show is revealed to be that of a Starship Troopers-variety \"Paragon Soldier\", existing only as a mannequin model to exemplify all that is supposedly \"noble\" about the Abh. The Terrans are grotesquely ugly both in appearance and character like I mentioned earlier, but it\\'s the Abh who will creep you out big-time when they finally reveal their true colours - only to get passed off as noble heroes by the show. Even creepier is the hornet symbolism of their emblems, which captures their shockingly blind hive-mentality, as well as their impulsive vengefulness and ferocity, rather too uncannily.\\nSo there you have it - Crest of the Stars started out as a grandly ambitious and extremely promising Space Opera show that seemed to challenge even Legend of the Galactic Heroes in its scope and emotional impact. Instead, it turned out to be something so nasty it beggars belief, and leaves you feeling sickened and horrified. The world of this show is a quietly creepy theatre of cruelty, populated by ugly and horrible people on both sides, where fairness and decency never stood a chance because the stakes were rigged all along. If, like me, you feel nostalgic for 90\\'s-era animation, or have a soft corner for shows with a tranquil and reflective atmosphere (and this show has it in spades), this show may seem like the best thing the anime medium has had to offer - at least initially. But in the end, you\\'re left feeling thoroughly cheated at an entertainment level - and not to mention utterly appalled at the horror you had to witness.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'dbf6f460d326a1354e61f2526a598807'}>,\n",

But it becomes quickly apparent that the ideas and focus regarding the universe take precedence over the development of Jinto and Lafiel\\'s relationship.

While it isn\\'t actually romance, it\\'s a start, for before a couple can be lovers, they must first become friends.\\nHearkening back to the galaxy-building, this is perhaps Crest of the Stars\\'s strongest point outside of the relationship between Jinto and Lafiel.

For example, there is an entire language specifically crafted for the Abh; factoids about the Four Nations Alliance and their tense relationship with the \"Kin of the Stars;\" scientific offerings in terms of measurements, space-travel, and technology; exploration into the Abh\\'s culture and way of life; and minor yet intriguing pieces that round out the experience. It\\'s done adequately enough, not feeling too overwhelming while still maintaining its own, unique identity.\\nWhere the anime begins to misstep is in the events that take place, or more specifically, their importance. The show is roughly sectioned into two parts: a quarter of which deal with large-scale war skirmishes and the remaining focusing on Jinto and Lafiel\\'s escapades. But where the macro instances hold both literal and figurative weight, the micro ones do not. That is, the main couple\\'s actions never feel as if they mean anything, in any regard. Whether it\\'s fighting their way out of a Baron\\'s domain or hijacking a vehicle to make it to the nearest city, their mark on everything that is going on around them is significantly smaller. Now, the purpose of placing so much emphasis on the two makes sense; the idea is to establish, explore, and eventually enact the relationship between Jinto and Lafiel. And while their relationship was done nicely, the events around them were not.\\nCrest of the Stars also misaligned itself in regard to its overall focus. Here, the show at first plays with the idea of our characters being \"birds trapped in cages.\" That is to say, their free but restricted in what they are capable of doing. Despite winning the hierarchical lottery, what the anime depicts are two young adults struggling to deal with a universe that looks at them for what they are, as opposed to who they are. And that\\'s vastly interesting...but is sadly dropped. The show goes from showcasing Lafiel\\'s interracial distance and Jinto\\'s unfair discrimination to more action-oriented scenes and having Jinto \"find his place.\" It\\'s an awkward transition, mostly because the former thematic direction was well-crafted but is suddenly forgotten and replaced with a more general message.\\nANIMATION\\nThe best way to describe Crest of the Stars\\'s art and animation would be a \"mixed bag.\"\\nThe art for the anime can be rather pleasant at times. The battleships, the star systems, the surface of planets; there are a multitude of different areas that are explored, each providing an appropriate mood for the given situation. The inside of the ships match the blue-hair of the Abh; outer space is dotted with stations and stars; and amusement parks, city streets, and forests are interspersed throughout the planets. At times, though, the anime uses this strange filter to give the effect of light or brightness that deters from the visuals rather than supports them.\\nThe character designs follow a similar trend. The Abh are beautiful and regal, with their pale skin, sharp eyes, and distinctly blue hair. Lafiel fits this description, but always sporting her military outfit. Unless, of course, the situation demands a change. Jinto dons similar attire, with a white-and-red cloak, brown, parted hair, and various costume changes when appropriate. The largest issue comes from their often irregularly shaped heads and jaws. It can, like the filtering, be wholly distracting.\\nActual animation is normally average to above-average. While there is a lot of talking and sitting -- at dinner tables, in a shuttle, or within a strategy room -- characters are usually moving or reacting to the words and sentences being said. Furthermore, the aforementioned battles demonstrate their prowess, with huge explosions, lasers, missiles, cruisers, and gunfire going off at all times.\\nCHARACTERS\\nCrest of the Stars, while involving space and war, is still an anime about our main duo: Jinto the Terran and Lafiel the Abh.\\nAs a descendant of the Abh, and especially of the royal family line, Lafiel finds herself in a precarious position. Direct yet respectful, she can normally be quite ignorant of the emotions and customs of non-Abh people. This is easily attributed to her race; they are taught to \"move forward\" when making decisions, are usually apathetic towards other species, and keep themselves away from non-Abh prevalent areas. But due to her logical reasoning and knowledge of the rest of the galaxy, she is able to support Jinto through the first half of their perilous adventure. And while she finds that completing one\\'s mission is admirable, she wishes she could do more. That is, she looks at herself as being \"useless\" in the grand scheme of things. The attack on Gosroth, fleeing from ships encircling the planet of Sufugnoff, getting exhausted from an absurd amount of running; despite demonstrating her prowess as a capable woman and an amazing friend, she still believes herself to be bringing those around her down, or at the minimum, not contributing enough to the efforts at hand. However, Jinto believes otherwise.\\nJinto was born and raised, for a time, as human. However, following a betrayal by his father towards their home planet, Jinto technically became a nobleman in the Humankind Abh Empire. Extremely caring to those around him and rather witty, he often finds himself being \"useless\" as well. More so than anything else, he feels useless alongside Lafiel. Not being able to console her during times of grief, taken hostage, unable to man spacecraft; he\\'s described as nothing more than a \"commodity\" that needs to be transported from one area to the next. But he moves from being the helped to the helper come the second half of the anime. This movement, where the roles are switched between Jinto and Lafiel, also occurs with a shift in location. They go from Abh-controlled territory to United Mankind dominion, and subsequently Jinto becomes the leader. And after having been the one in reliance and the one relied upon, he discovers that everyone goes through what he has. That people hold \"strengths and weaknesses,\" that everyone is a \"bird in a cage.\" Everyone needs aid from time to time, whether you\\'re a noble count or a royal princess. It makes no difference, for when one\\'s weaknesses are at play, he or she must lean on someone\\'s strengths. In other words, someone else will bring the key, open that birdcage door, and set that bird free.\\nLooking at both Jinto and Lafiel, both here and within the anime, it becomes evident: they\\'re \"the same, but different.\" It\\'s not just about him being a Terran and her being an Abh, it\\'s in the way they carry themselves, how they\\'re perceived, and what they know of their counterpart\\'s culture. In short, they learn from each other over the course of the show. Jinto realizes the difference between killing and protecting, and that there are times when one has to face danger head on. For Lafiel, she comes to understand that the logical choice isn\\'t always the correct path; sometimes you have to do what\\'s right instead of what\\'s right. Beyond learning from each other, they learn about each other, too. Their various customs, lore, and upbringings allow them to connect with one another more so than with anyone else they have known their entire lives. And that\\'s what Crest of the Stars accomplishes: creating the start of a dichotomous, trusting, and loving relationship.\\nSOUND\\nThe OP is quite orchestral in its composition. The track begins with hard drums and violins, leading into a fantastical arrangement with that strange feeling of space permeating it. With more trumpets, violins, and high and low points, the piece ends in mysterious fashion, making it a nice fit for the show at hand.\\nThe ED is one of the most 90\\'s songs I\\'ve listened to in quite a while. The slow piano and simple acoustic guitar playing fill the background initially. The vocalist is \"by himself\" for the first half, but when the second half kicks in, a common drum-and-cymbal beat appears alongside the, \"I wanna fly away!\" lyric. Coupled with the \"oh-ohhh-oh\" singing and its general slowness, it can actually be quite catchy to listen to.\\nThe rest of the soundtrack mostly follows in the OP\\'s footsteps. More space-like pieces filled with trickling instrumental effects and violins; flute and low-keyed piano ones during more tense situations; chimes, flutes, and violins in unison follow the more thoughtful moments; and guitar and drums when battles are underway. Each track fits well during the scenes in which they are played, but sadly, none are impressive on their own.\\nVoice-acting-wise, everyone involved performs in or around average. There are no special shout-outs to be had.\\nENJOYMENT\\nWith romance as my favorite genre, I went into this one expecting to see a good amount of it. But as it went on, and as was already detailed somewhat, it was not about romance; it was about leading up to romance. Which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. It was great to see Jinto and Lafiel risking their lives to save one another on numerous occasions, despite having only met a few days prior. And honestly, anything beyond what they gave near the ending of the season would have been too much, and would have betrayed what the goal of the anime was. Which, reiterating once more, is starting their relationship. In the following seasons, I\\'ll be awaiting to see their blossoming romance unfold.\\nThe war and the fights, both in space and on land, were fun to watch at times, but not nearly as interesting as Jinto and Lafiel\\'s dynamic. There, it would be funny at times, with Jinto making jokes with Lafiel and her being rather fun herself, despite her background.\\nAs a final note, Dorin Ku, Jinto\\'s only friend back on his planet of Delktoe, had a surprisingly well done segment; from his ten minutes of screen time alone, he was able to personify the epitome of \"best friend.\" Which made it a shame to see him leave as quickly as he appeared. But as a final negative, there were too many \"100 vs 2\" moments, breaking some of the \"reality\" of the situations that took place.\\nCrest of the Stars is an anime featuring racial disparity, space wars, and an interesting couple. While the story and animation are lacking, the characters and music help to alleviate some of its shortcomings. But this is just the beginning of Jinto and Lafiel\\'s relationship, and subsequently the beginning of the series. Hopefully, what is left in store will be able to pick up the slack.\\nSUMMARY\\nStory: Fine, \"Spice and Wolf, in space,\" adequate world-building, weightless events, thematically lost\\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, weird filter, okay character designs, good actual animation\\nCharacters: Good, Jinto and Lafiel begin their dichotomous, trusting, and loving relationship\\nSound: Good, good OP, nice ED, good soundtrack, average VA work\\nEnjoyment: Fine, not enough romance to my liking, some fun writing here and there, they win too many clearly stacked battles\\nFinal Score: 6/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '89c9aa7702c50e61b7b1ba234c33c93'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"In the far future, mankind is on the brink of entering a galactic war with the alien race Abh, as earth is preparing for battle, without firing a single plasma beam, their leader Rock Linn surrenders. In the middle of all this is Jinto Linn, the cowardly leader's son whom is only at the time 10 years old. What will become of mankind after its conquering? Will the human race be destroyed? Who are the Abh and what are their intentions? These answers and more in the beginning of the epic Seikai saga!\\nStory\\nThe main story begins 7 years after mankind’s surrender to the Abh. Jinto\\nis now 17 years old. During the last 7 years Jinto was on Planet Delct, training for the Abh miltary as well as learning the Abh language. While departing, he meets the beautiful young female Abh solder Lafiel. Little does Jinto know, but Laifel is the future princess for the Abh. What we get out of the main story is not only adventure, romance and action, but international space politics that show the problems the nations are going through and what they want. Not many anime do this. If you are interested in an all action show you will not get it here. Yes there is great action, but most of that is saved for the sequel. This anime has a lot of dialog, but its not boring or pointless.\\nArt\\nThe artwork for crest of the stars is done well, even though it looks like how most  animes in the 90s did. Where the art does well is the atmosphere. It feels very misty and dream like. The backgrounds on the space stations are creative. The art gives you a feeling of a living breathing world.\\nSound\\nThe music for crest of the stars is great, and help makes the show feel like a real scifi epic. (which it is) The opening song is a tribute to classic SciFi shows of the 1950s and 60s gives the viewer promise of adventure and wonder. The space battle music pumps up the action well, music and background music for calmer moments are at times dreamlike, it fits the space mood very well\\nCharacters\\nThe characters are very well developed, this is due to the many long conversations in the story. Jinto is put into a unique situation, but he is relatable since he is the only major human character. Laifel is the fan favorite, and she does not act like a wishy washy disney princess who just wants more of everything. She is logical but not a genius, she does what she thinks for her country. There are many more characters in the Crest of the stars saga and her sequel, and some are are as developed as Jinto and Laifel.\\nOverall\\nCrest of the stars is a great anime with a interesting story and superb character development. Its a shame it did not receive the attention it deserves in western countries. I blame this on the bad marketing bandai had as well as the bad English dub. (watch with Japanese subs) If you are into scifi, or just want a good story with good characters check out Crest of the stars.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b21ebb8373ab347c57e6d5b60f798a73'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Okay, I\\'ll make an attempt to be brief, but the stuff goes deep. I\\'ll remark that I was not going to write a review here, but some stuff I saw in reviews here made me stumble a little bit and sit down to a keyboard.\\nSo, this anime is far, FAR from perfect. My major gripes are with animation quality and sound direction.\\n1. Animation is very, very choppy at times. Many animations are clearly reused, others are not there at all, with static images instead of moving objects or whole scenes. Yes, clearly, those are the result of budget being to small. but this is till\\nan issue. Luckily, art style and great visual design pulls the series off this pitfall, making visual aesthetic do the job.\\n2. While the soundtrack itself rather good,consisting of epic orchestral compositions suitable for imperial scale of the setting and the Cosmos itself, with some more melancholic or cheerful themes here and there, it\\'s often misused, with sappy melodies over already too sappy moments. The result feels too tryhardy and kinda unnatural, taking away instead of improving the atmosphere of certain scenes. Luckily, it\\'s not too commonplace, but the stuff is there.\\n3. I will be silent on English dub, because oh Warp, English dub; this should be watched in Japanese. But there we have Jinto, the protagonist. It seems seiyu was not told his character is a 10 years old boy only in several scenes, not in *all* of them. His voicework just does not fit the character we see. Yes, Jinto can be sloppy, overly emotional, shy etc., but he still is a young man of decisive nature, who is absolutely able to create commanding presence. The guy who voices him cannot, though. And this is a huge failure.\\n4. The director really, really likes to remind stuff to the viewer, and to place scenes out of order. While in some cases it does work, for the most part it just breaks the pacing, especially when SUDDEN flashback - preferably to something we already saw - breaks an interesting conversation. These get rare as story progresses, but episodes 1 to 3 are a complete mess.\\nI\\'d say these issues would kill any media product from me, but in this case we have such an outstanding *rest of stuff*, I cannot even lower the overall score despite what I just said before.\\nFirst and foremost - the storytelling here lines up with classic, more \"hard\" kind of sci-fi. You won\\'t see robots with swords or schoolboys shooting beams of light out of their... somethings. There are people who do their jobs using technology. There are societies, that exist and evolve, and interact separately from each other. Those societies have their interests, goals and ideals some or most of their members pursue, forming cultures and ideologies that are doomed to clash. Those cultures manifest in all spheres of life - architecture, cloth, traditions, technologies, designs etc.\\nThe driving force of the story is a paradox of an expansionist empire. A romanticised vision of Prussia, ancient China, Russian Empire or early stages of forming of USA. How does the empire expand? What does it do to its subordinates and conquered areas? Can an expansionist empire be the force for good? The authors clash several empires in a battle, with motives and methods of each being clear.\\nWe have Abh, formed from artificial slave labour rebelling against their slavery to form a space-faring machine of expansion, with final goal of ending of all wars. We have classic humanity, which is losing the expansion race of post-diasporal unification. Can we blame Abh, actions of which are dictated by their own nature? Can we blame the rest of united mankind for creating them, and then despising and fearing them? Humanity is afraid of Abh expansion for a reason, but they lead their own expansion as well. Whose expansion is more righteous - Abh, mankind, both, neither? Whether your personal outlook on subject matter - can the opposing faction be completely dehumanised in order to achieve victory? In history of mankind there were no wars without dehumanisation of opponents; it is in human nature to explain killing of your own with them not being humans for one reason or another. The Abh are a fantastic assumption as of itself - they do not treat their enemies as non-humans. On the contrary, the centrepiece of Abh philosophy is based around humanity of both their enemies and themselves. Notice the way Abh engage with the lands they\\'ve conquered: whatever their leaders say, they do one thing: remove defences, remove ownership of interstellar spacecraft, forcefully open trade. And that\\'s it. No other policies are fed upon the populace. United mankind acts... Just like mankind does, aren\\'t they? Ideological opposition is eliminated, separatist movements are destroyed, wrongthink is forcefully ejected by expansive propaganda, and after THAT all the freedoms and democratic way of life are the topic of the day. Whatever country you live in - I assure you, this is the way things are there. It can be done in a more fine way, or brutforced (like where I live), but it is there. All of it.\\nThis is why the Abh concept is so interesting: what if such an entity existed? How would it operate? It\\'s still populated by humans, so they still have their own motives, characters, wishes, dreams and goals. Can the culture to nurture the idea of humanism as its foundation even exist?\\nYou can also draw parallels to Robert Heinlein\\'s Starship Troopers with Abh. ST is often considered to be a pro-fascist book, which it isn\\'t. In actuality systems described by Heinlein are active in most societies with access to election limited by several barriers. In this case the imaginary social structure is vastly different and built around a meritocratic feudalism, whatever I just said. As any imaginary concept, this one can barely be supposed to work, as it provides far, far too many ways for abuse, but luckily in sci-fi we have such a beautiful thing like fantastical assumption, which allows Abh history to occur and for Abh empire to be believable.\\nBut what makes CotS to be really great is its ability to say \"To hell with it\" - and instead of being a philosophical work in guise of sci-fi, like Heinlein\\'s work, it is actually a personal story of people in this implied scenario. The story creates likeable characters with interesting backgrounds. Of course, the centre of attention is the Empire (it\\'s still the thought experiment, don\\'t forget) but what we follow is the growing and maturing of people within the researched culture, instead of direct cultural analysis as it is. Jinto, Lafiel, imperial admirals, nobility, commoners, land livers and United Humanity representatives - they all are interesting characters first and foremost, and only afterwards they are the tools of author\\'s idea. This is where the good stories are born. And this is why CotS and its sequels are so great to watch. You can easily ignore the large scale stuff and watch the story of growing up of interesting characters in fantastical environment - or you might want to dig deeper and engage the ideas presented here.\\nIt\\'s sad some reviewers either miss the point, or even outright cross CotS out for exactly what science fiction as a genre exists for - allowing unusual, unbelievable concepts based on reality but impossible within it to come through the prism of author\\'s imagination and be shaped into piece of art.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3c4e169edfc083bd7280d8ff0d9b4f0f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '星界の紋章 – Seikai no Monshou: The show has a great script that was taken from the Mangaka Morioka Hiroyuki novel of the same name from 1996. Directed by Nagaoka Yasuchika, the TV series Crest of the Stars has become a rarity that offers a lot of background despite only 13 episodes and impresses with well-designed settings and demanding dialogues. The focus is on the relationship between the two main characters Lafiel and Jinto. By the way, there is also a manga version.\\nStory: against conventions; world setting & characters well-built, interactions with bitter humor at times (8,5/10)\\nIn a distant future, the Abh people will occupy the\\nHyde Stars system. The overwhelming spectacle of the huge spaceship fleet fades away the thoughts of resistance. The president handed over the entire Hyde system without firing a shot. However, this should only be the starting point of the actual story, which will be about the President\\'s son, young Lin Jinto. Through the actions of his father, the young man Jinto receives the rank of count among the nobility of the Abh. Here the real story begins and takes a different path than expected in every aspect. The series does not show great commanders like Ginga Eiyū Densetsu, but the adventures of our young count at the side of his no less noble companion Lafiel, a born Abh. Those who hope that this story is viewed as both warlike and from a human perspective will be disappointed. Again, the story takes a different course and does not focus on war, although it is always the linchpin of the story. The focus is on a really well told love story with lots of good dialogues that unfold in the turmoil of war. It is a sophisticated science fiction series in which the Manga-ka has put a lot of effort and creativity. This is shown not least in the fact that a whole language \"Baronh\", including an alphabet, was created as Conlang for the series.\\nCharacters: a wide variety with well-described character profiles (8.5 / 10)\\nThe cast is just too big to describe them all. Therefore I want to focus on the two main characters and describe a few more characters that I personally liked.\\nLin (Shu Rock Yalulug Dril Hydal) Jinto:\\nJinto is the male leading actor and also the first one we get to know. As the son of Rock Lin, the former President of the Hyde Star System, he bears the title of a count. His behavior is characterized by an initially insecure and reserved manner. It\\'s not that he doesn\\'t embark on adventure when it catches up with him, but he doesn\\'t plunge head over heels into one. His childhood was not bad, but his father was always very busy and had little time for his son. Jinto\\'s mother, a mining engineer, died shortly after his birth in a mining accident. So it happened that the secretary Mr. Clint Teal took over the education of the young Jinto. Because of his rank as a Abh nobleman, he was sent to the planet Delktou to be taught in Baronh, the language of the Abh and their culture. A few years later, as is customary for Abh nobleman, Jinto is supposed to attend a military academy in order to join the armed forces later. His departure from the spaceport will be a crucial moment in his life and in that of Lafiel. So, stay tuned.\\n(Abriel Nei Debrusc Borl Paryun) Lafiel:\\nThe young Abh-beauty, who is already serving in the armed forces, is Jinto\\'s escort and shuttle pilot to the spaceship \"Gosroth\", which Jinto is to take to the military school in Lakfakalle.\\nLafiel is strong-willed and, due to her descent as a princess, very familiar with the courtly behaviour of the Abh nobility. However, she is rather straightforward and doesn\\'t want to be treated like a princess either. This peculiarity and the way Jinto approaches her without knowing her origin is basically the perfect beginning for their friendship and its development. Personally, I took her to my heart the moment Jinto asked her for her name and she turned to him with an enthusiastic smile and said it would be nice if you call me \"Lafiel\". Jinto is not yet aware of the honor this represents. It is comparable to Japan, it is not common to address someone by their first name, but if it is desired, this speaks for a very special close relationship. Regardless of her idiosyncratic nature, she is very mature for a teenager (16 years old) and, with logic, is able to grasp most situations and find a suitable solution. However, sometimes her impulsive, more emotional side takes over and she doubts about herself. This shows again and again that the chemistry between her and Jinto fits very well. It is a lot of fun to watch the two and their development, because Jinto is more of a down-to-earth person. However, in order to understand the overall picture of their development, it would be good to look at the second part (Banner of Stars) as well. I think the Lafiel is a very successful figure. A little triviality, her first name \"Lafiel\" is very similar in pronunciation to the French \"La fille\" (= the girl).\\nLexshue Wef-Robell Plakia:\\nShe is the captain of the patrol ship Gosroth, to which Lafiel brings Jinto. Her personality captivates from the beginning. Her calm and thoughtful manner, which does not hide the fact that she is an experienced woman and a proud, dutiful officer, is very well and impressively portrayed. The successful balance between her personal bond and the obligation as captain is very well represented in the discussion between her and Lafiel. Her inner conflict will only become fully apparent after Jinto and Lafiel are sent to Sufugnoff, when an attack on the Gosroth is inevitable. A great personality and a good presentation, I like this character very much.\\nVisuals: certainly the weakest aspect, but I like the overall design (6.5 / 10)\\nThe drawing style of the series is very much based on the original, and that\\'s a big plus for me. I really like the adaptation of Watabe Keisuke\\'s character-design. It struck me very positively that the faces of the Abh have slightly rough shapes, but in the diplomatic and subtle dialogues the faces show very well-made facial expressions. The sometimes very introverted behavior of the characters is reflected very impressively in the very convincing facial expressions. Even if the design of the characters and machines, as well as other objects is rather simple, especially at the beginning, the series as a whole stands out by the many small things. These make it clear how well thought out the Mangaka Morioka-san created the worlds, machines, objects and people. I also liked the fact that the series has a bit of eroticism but doesn\\'t use clumsy ecchi. All female characters are very pretty to look at and some have a special feminine charm, such as Beneej Spoor. It\\'s appealing without being cheap, which makes the series attractive in my eyes. On the other hand, the backgrounds are mostly simple. Well, some of the rooms in the spaceships have paintings and tapestries with family crests or decorations with attractive furniture, but most are rather plain. On the other hand, it is noticeable that e.g. Landscapes are very detailed and beautifully designed. Keep in mind that the anime is already very old.\\nHowever, Sunrise\\'s animation is rather average and this aspect could be distracting for viewers who are quite picky when it comes to smooth movements. Even if the movements seem a bit bumpy at times, the camera work is great and knows how to support the dialogue directing with well done camera angles and close-ups. I felt that the space battles, which are basically not the core of the story, to be relatively well done. The atmosphere is a bit like a mixture of Star Trek and Blade Runner. The battles are explained, affect the story and the characters, but the focus is still on the main characters and their actions. In this respect the priorities are set correctly. Nevertheless, there are also events which, despite their visual simplicity, are impressively staged by very good musical emphasis. I mentioned the example of the Abh invasion at the beginning of my review. All in all, considering the age of the anime,  I don\\'t see in the visualization a sufficient reason not to try the series at least.\\nSounds: BGM very well done, also the OP, very good VA (8.5 / 10)\\nThe background music was composed by Hattori, Katsuhisa and contains some wonderful musical arrangements. Even if not all music is spectacular, I like to hear, for example: \"Shounen Ghintec\", \"Genzai\" (Abh no Theme) with the beautiful panpipe melody, \"Lamhirh to Yobuga\" with solo piano and panpipe, a wonderful harmonic arrangement with the orchestra. But also \"Zenkan Sankai! Wakuran no Shukujo Spaurh\" is extremely sonorous and gives the scenes underlined with it an exciting framework. I find the musical arrangements to be accentuating and entertaining.\\nHattori-san also composed the OP \"Seikai no Monshou\". A pure instrumental that communicates the orientation of the anime as a space opera very well. The prelude of the orchestra conveys a sonorous tension and is very suitable for the series. Moreover, it awakens strong memories of the title melody from Star Wars. The image design is very suitable for the OP, especially concerning the selection and timing of the pictures.\\nThe EDs are from the episode 1-12 \"Ushinawareta Aozora\" by the band TimeSlip-Rendzvous. The formation founded in 1994 has already released several albums and convinces with a clear rock sound. The lyrics match the anime and conclude the episode with a slow, slightly melancholic ending, which is additionally underlined by the vocals of Kingo Kondo.\\nThe 13th episode is closed with the title of the OP \"Seikai no Monshou\".\\nThe dialogues are very well written and for the audio recording, the sound department has put together a selection of very famous artists who bring the characters of the series to life.\\nFirst the main characters. Lafiel is spoken by Kawasumi, Ayako. Kawasumi-san is a very experienced voice actress, but in 1999 she was just beginning her career. Her great ability to think her way into the speaking role and convey it compellingly to the audience is already evident in the portrayal of the young Abh aristocrat.\\nThe role of Jinto is spoken by a woman, as it is not uncommon in the depiction of young men in anime. Imai, Yuka lends Jinto her voice and gives him his rather reserved, yet caring charm.\\nBut I would also like to talk about the supporting roles, because there are also very good voice actors.\\nCaptain Lexshue is spoken by Takashima, Gara. Her clear, soft voice, which is powerful yet very feminine, fits the character perfectly. I think her performance is the best of the supporting roles.\\nIn my opinion, the narrator also deserves a mention. The pronunciation of Baronh as the language of the Abh, which the Mangaka Morioka-san created on the basis of ancient Japanese and which even has its own alphabet, was certainly a challenge for Jō, Haruhiko. Especially in Seikai no Monshō, as each episode begins with a new prologue.\\nI highly recommend Seikai no Monshō and the sequel Seikai no Senki, hidden jewels in the field of epic science fiction space operas, but they are not series for pure action fans! I am sure that those who like series with depth and good dialogues, like \"Spice and Wolf\", to name just one more example, will also enjoy these series from 1999 and 2000.\\nThanks for reading and have fun watching.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a3f86c72000316a7381ac8b00db71ff4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Science-fiction has got to be one of my favourite genres. Some of my most beloved books are sci-fi, and it doesn't take much sifting through them to figure out what I like. I love the meshing of human and alien cultures; seeing how they interact with one another and how they compare and contrast is one of the most fascinating parts of those sort of books, in my opinion. Spaceship battles take a back seat – while they can be interesting, I have to be invested in the characters first. That's what psychology and the glimpse of a well-written and imagined society give me: grounds\\nto care for the characters, relate to them, and become concerned for their fates. So when I heard that Seikai no Monshou, or Crest of the Stars if you prefer the English title, combined science-fiction, politics, and romance, naturally, I was sold. Unfortunately, the end result proved to not be so captivating.\\nThe series follows the main protagonist, Jinto, and his tribulations as he deals with becoming a nobleman of the Abh empire despite being a regular human. For the sake of simplicity, the Abh are basically space elves, although it's stated that they were descended from humans many years before. The second protagonist is Lafiel, a princess of the Abh empire and a full-blooded Abh herself. Naturally, one predicts they'll get together, but this is presumably reserved for later seasons. This one mainly focuses on the pair as they find themselves in the middle of a war between the Abh empire and an anti-Abh sect of humans.\\nJinto is a scholarly, reserved young man looking to fit in; Lafiel is a blunt but honourable young woman who also wishes to fit in. Both feel incompetent or useless in their respective societies and circles. As such, they are similar yet dissimilar, and that ought to be more than enough grounds for their interactions to be compelling and interesting. Unfortunately, they aren't; the way Seikai no Monshou pans out, their actions and turmoils are highly insignificant in comparison to anything else. I'm left feeling dysphoric and completely uninterested in what Lafiel and Jinto are doing – even bored. I usually have no problem whatsoever with slow pacing; indeed, I hardly notice it unless it is pointed out to me. Seikai no Monshou's pacing is almost as painful as trying to swim in molasses, and left me yawning distractedly as I wondered when the episode would end.\\nOne of the main problems the series has is that we have little to no reason to empathize with the main characters, partially because we hardly know anything about them. They simply react to the situations they are put into; as viewers, we feel detached from the action. To make matters worse, the anime pushes too many ideologies and too much information on us to be realistically manageable. This is usually achieved by a narrator at the start of each episode, reciting some explanations or historically significant event that seems, at the very best, loosely connected to the episode itself. I have no problem with politics and intrigue; in fact, I think it can be fascinating if done well, but Seikai no Monshou makes no effort to connect us to the information it is spewing at us.\\nLet's get a book as an example, shall we? C.J. Cherryh's First Contact series is, in a superficial way, similar to Seikai no Monshou (part of the reason I was so eager to start the anime in the first place). The books are centred around a human male protagonist and his experiences and trials as he learns to coexist in a completely alien culture. Politics play a large role in this series, but it is interesting, because the main character is involved and affected by the goings on around him. Not to mention, he's also a pretty capable politician. Seikai no Monshou doesn't do this. Instead of making the main characters a part of the intrigue, allowing us to learn with them and make connections with events ourselves, we are treated to a cheap form of exposition that does nothing at all to make us empathize or sympathize with, well, anyone, really. There is far too much “telling” me things, and not enough “showing”.\\nLuckily, episodes 9 and up are far more interesting and engaging than the previous ones. The sole reason for this is that Lafiel and Jinto actually get a bit of a breather and are able to interact with one another. In addition, they commingle with other people and have to figure out how to survive on a planet occupied by an army who does not like Abhs. That isn't to say that they didn't interact with people before; it's just that the majority of them were Abhs, and most of the interactions took place in spaceships. The problem, then, is that Abhs just aren't very interesting. I considered if this was because the Abhs can be thought of as quite “alien” and thus inaccessible, since they think vastly different from us lowly humans. However, upon further examination, I realized that this was simply not true. Plenty forms of fiction can make aliens different and perfectly strange, but still interesting. Thus, one's indifference to the Abh race can only be constituted as a product of poor writing.\\nDespite all this, when the anime skips all the dreary exposition, the battles in space that just feel like a time filler, and the dull character interactions, it can actually be pretty good. It does a decent job of building up a general idea of the atmosphere in the first two episodes, and, as stated before, the final four to five episodes are truly enjoyable and do make me more interested in the rest of the series. Overall, though, it would be best not to get your hopes up too much. It's a childish and draggy show at its core. Hopefully, the remaining seasons will redeem it. Since the anime was adapted from novels, I imagine that they handle the topic and plot far better.\\nSeikai no Monshou's soundtrack is quite good. Composed by Katsuhisa Hattori, it is very orchestral in nature and feels very “classical”. The opening theme is especially worth mentioning; it is a purely instrumental piece that is very pleasing to the ear and gets you excited for the episode to come, at least for the first couple times you hear it. The rest of the soundtrack, while more than satisfactory, tends to feel out of place in the grand scheme of things. It's rather as if the anime tries to feel more epic and sophisticated than it actually is. The ending theme is highly reminiscent of a ballad. Called Ushinawareta Aozora and performed by TimeSlip-Rendzvous, I personally wasn't too fond of it, but it's an acceptable bit of music. As for the voice actors, I didn't particularly find vexation with any of them, but I wasn't blown away, either.\\nSunrise's artwork is honestly very hit-or-miss. The colours are typically bland and not all that eye-catching. There are scenes where the drawings are beautiful, but those are fairly few. More often than not, the characters look awkward, overly kiddish (and by that, I mean the art makes it seem like the anime's demographic is six year olds), or just plain deformed. The spaceship designs are pretty nice, though. Simply put, the art does its job, and while it's mediocre at times, it can occasionally impress.\\nOverall, Seikai no Monshou is an acceptable science-fiction show, and while it certainly won't have you on the edge of your seat, it's all right if you want to whet your appetite for aliens. What it doesn't offer is strong character relationships or an interesting plot, but it's all right for what it does. You could certainly do worse. Who knows, it might be the prelude to a truly epic tale that blows all the competition right out of the water – but for now, it's a pretty lacklustre start for the series as a whole.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"The very essence of cartoons is that they possess the ability to 'stretch reality'. In other words, to take an initial idea or assumption that we are all familiar with and then start pulling at it very hard. Taking that which is so clearly absurd and taking it to its logical conclusion.\\nThis is why cartoons and satire make for excellent bedfellows. Since after all, the latter is doing exactly the same thing. From Hogarth to Watterson, with Tenniel, Shultz, Uderzo, and Groening somewhere inbetween. Yet rarely if ever has anyone dared to make a good space satire. Animated or otherwise.\\nThough it may seem at first\\nglance a simple thing to do. After all the sheer preposterous of the genre might lend suggest that it seems ripe for a good ribbing. But good satire requires a certain sense of subtlety, at least to start off with. Not an easy feat when the story begins with spacemen from the planet Zog.\\nThere have been some noble attempts in the past, most notably Douglas Adam's sublime 'Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Yet even then, an almost unrivaled comic flair (not to mention a quotability up there with Blackadder and Monty Python) is fatally undermined by an uneven narrative. '\\nRed Dwarf' on the other hand presents a much more conventional proposition. Being as it is a standard (albeit first rate) sit-com set in space, thus with all the jokes being references to the eccentricities and inconsistencies of its chosen genre. Thus what it presents in barrel laughs, it lacks in any sense of subtlety.\\nWhich is what makes the entire 'Crest of the Stars' series such an astonishing piece of work. Unquestionably the single finest  satire on the space (and/or space opera) genre that I have ever seen. All the great works from the Anglo-American tradition are put to the sword.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Crest of the Stars is a tale of futuristic fighting between two factions: the \"alien\" race of the Abh and mankind. The Abh aren\\'t necessarily alien as they are enhanced humans - they have altered genes that give them prominent features such as longer youth and blue hair. They were originally intended to be \"living machines\" to mankind but soon found independence on a space voyage for new planets to inhabit. They follow a imperial system, with influential families having elaborate names and taking top positions in the economy or military. Humans are split into 4 differ factions that ultimately make the United Mankind. A\\nmajority of the ones shown in the anime carry a grudge against the Abh. This is due to the fact that the Abh have gone from rebels seeking independence to galaxy conquerors. The Abh have military and economic dominion over the United Mankind. Now, in an ironic move, mankind seeks freedom and independence from those that wanted their independence. Despite this seeming like a good start for a story, the anime does not focus on the huge war taking place. The effects and some small fighting moments are shown, but they are not the main story. Instead, it takes a more personal look at two characters caught up in this war: Jinto and Lafiel.\\nJinto is a young boy who is the son of the Hyde star system\\'s president. His father, Rock Lin, made a shady deal as their world was taken over by the Abh: rather than fight the invaders, he opted to become the territorial lord. This by effect made Jinto Abh nobility. Seven years after this event, he is on his way to a military college in the Abh\\'s capital where he meets Lafiel. Lafiel also carries social influence - born in the Abriel family, she is a princess and the granddaughter of the Abh\\'s empress. She currently works as a flying trainee trying to work her way up in the military. The anime follows the two trying to reach their destination only to be sidetracked by the war taking place - their tale turns from one of an escort mission to that of survival.\\nTheir personalities, as you would expect, are quite different from another. Jinto is more relaxed and calm, while Lafiel is serious and straightforward. The two protagonists form an interesting dynamic with each other. Due to her military experience, Lafiel is sharp when it comes to controlling ships or coming up with a strategic plan. Jinto is more aware of social cues and is able to help them keep a low profile in enemy territory or ease a tense situation. With personality traits like these, they have good chemistry with each other (that also hints at a bit of romance). The moments where they are alone and discuss what to do next are some of the better moments in the series. The talk may be a bit more formal, but their conversations always have a friendly delivery with each other that feels natural for them. Had this show been a character study in a more low-key setting, it would make for a great series.\\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. Crest of the Stars still seeks to be a space opera full of grand bombast and wonder despite focusing mainly on two characters. Mixed between the relationship of Jinto and Lafiel are battle scenes and side characters that ultimately fall flat. This is due to not enough time being put on these elements. A show can\\'t achieve a full complex environment in only 13 episodes and still spend a majority of its time on its two leads - some elements will have to be cut. This results in many of the dire circumstances feeling like \"misadventures\", such as when they are \"held captive\" by the Baron Klowal. Rather than fear for our heroes, I was ultimately watching as to when they will escape because of the lack of tension. The battles that Laimsairh and Spoor, two of the Abh ship leaders in the war, are involved in have no weight because we hardly know the opponent they\\'re fighting. Additionally, because they interact so sparingly with the main two, it feels like episode fluff rather than seeing a smart or flashy military battle. Crest of the Stars wants to be a space opera but in reality is a romanticized adventure.\\nCharacter wise, Lafiel is fine due to her straight shooter attitude, but Jinto can be a bit questionable at times. I at first (and still mostly do) found him to be a breath of fresh air in terms of a lead. He\\'s not the manliest guy, but he doesn\\'t overreact or make a big deal of the scene around him, making him more human than cartoon. This goes a bit too far in situations where there IS something to worry about - in other words, he underreacts. In scenes where death should be lurking around his corner, he is strangely calm and makes lighthearted remarks. I can give him the benefit of the doubt and say he\\'s near fearless, but his relaxed attitude makes it so any scene wanting to be intense feels deflated. The other characters are eclipsed by these two, so characters that could be interesting like the ones in Marca\\'s group or Laimsairh are sadly sidelined.\\nIn more general terms, the Abhs and mankind are also characters that can be faulted, but this is more of the way the show presents them instead of who they actually are. Some stories have very simple sides to choose (heroes vs. villains) while other stories like to show each side has mixed morals and ultimately either side is right in their means. Crest of the Stars wants to do both, trying to throw cries of independence and goodwill at both sides while making the humans have a more negative appearance (lying, violent propaganda) while the Abhs have a more positive appearance (graceful appearance, gentle yet firm speech). If this were a political piece, surely the audience would lambast this as strawmanning. Even the narrator\\'s opening shifts sides, starting with an overview of the world before telling twisted tales of the Good Samaritan to bolster the Abhs. Though there\\'s an argument for this show being imperial propaganda, I don\\'t think it\\'s as much imperial propaganda as much as it is bad directing/storytelling. It\\'s much easier to write simple sides than to give each side its own reason for being good. Even shows like LoGH fall victim to this, albeit they do it in much less of a \"kneejerk\" way. Again, a lesser scope or more episodes can avoid this. Sadly, this is the end result.\\nThese last two issues are not as dire as the first (to me, it\\'s worse to be not invested in a show than anything else), but are still some faults of the show. Of course, all of these faults could ultimately be due to the adaptation. The novels the anime was based on won a Seiun Award, an honor given to the best Japanese science fiction works of the year. The novels may carry more detail than what the anime can show, so perhaps it needed 2 cours to fully show off its potential.\\nVisually, the animation is fine. It can come off as a bit on the budget side at times, but it looks decent in motion (especially in the faster paced-scenes). Adding to this is the good use of multi-tone shading, an older tradition that looks as great now as it did then. The character models can look a bit strange at times, with an odd curve in their skull (this is most apparent in Seelnay\\'s appearance) but it stays consistent and there\\'s really no off-models with the look. The soundtrack is very good, with big string sections and pleasant tracks giving the right mood to each scene. The ED, \"Ushinawareta Aozora\", is a catchy, nostalgic sounding sing-along and works great alongside the pictures of the two protagonists growing up. The voice acting is fine for what the show gives us - it\\'s a formal setting, so formal voices are to be expected. A bit more passion from Jinto would and a slightly less annoying voice for Seelnay would be preferred, but they all do a good job playing their roles.\\nOverall, I give Crest of the Stars a 5.5 out of 10. The truth is that Crest of the Stars cannot do anything Legend of the Galactic Heroes does better in the space opera genre. A show like LoGH covers a wider and more detailed look at politics, tactics and human behavior than Crest of the Stars does, even within its first 13 episodes. A made-up language and fancy names can only distract a viewer so long. Crest of the Stars might be liked if you want something more romantic, but otherwise I would avoid unless you are an avid fan of the genre tags.\\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Studio Sunrise just pumps out anime. Also, there are two people to note of in terms of the Crest/Banner of the Stars anime (Seikai Series), and those are unknown director Yasuchika Nagaoka whom worked on all of the Seikai Series before going freelance, and original creator Hiroyuki Morioka. Notably, Morioka created an entire language with an alphabet (Ath) called Baronh just for the main alien race, the Abh. From 1999-2005 the Seikai Series anime went through 3 separate seasons plus an OVA to finish up.\\nSeikai’s story focuses around a young man named Jinto. As a child, his planet was taken over by the Abh and\\nhis father negotiates that he and his son be given nobility status within the Abh in exchange for the planet, in simple terms. Quickly Jinto goes off to nobility school to learn the culture and language of the Abh. Upon going off to military school, which is custom for all Abh, he meets the young Abh Princess Lafiel. Of course, their ship gets into conflict with a developing war, and the story goes from there.\\nCharacter designs are different to say the least. It tends to be a bit repetitive with the Abh, and humans are generally portrayed as Neanderthals. However, it does come with good reason. The Abh are a genetically engineered race that are supposed to look the same, while humans are meant to be portrayed as the inferior race. This also makes a point in the ways political conflicts are handled on both sides without giving away spoilers. Almost every detail in the Seikai Series has a point one way or another, and it’s done very well. From the opera music in this space opera anime, makes sense, to the written dialogue with not all races speaking the same native tongue, makes sense, the Seikai Series is an anime that really breaks boundaries on the typical sci-fi front. Even the romance is done well in how Jinto and Lafiel’s relationship develops from their first meeting all the way to the OVA. Next to the politics and space battles with subtle romance as a sub-plot, the only anime that comes close to this amount of detail is Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\\nFrom the hard space action of Crest of the Stars, to the political struggle and war of Banner of the Stars, even the romance development and civil conflicts of the OVA, the Seikai Series is an anime of wonder.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Seikai no Monshou is a must see for space-alien anime fanatics, of any age, despite that a lot of people do not like anime from before 2000. In my opinion, this show is great because of how successful it became, with two other full sequels and a bunch of ova\\'s, specials, and movies to go along with. This series was fun to watch and easily got me hooked. As the story progresses, one can feel fully immersed in this space world, and even find themselves in relatable positions. The story is about a boy, Jinto, who is the son of the president of Planet Martine.\\nWhen the planet is invaded by the Abh empire, the president gives up without a fight in return for nobility status; thus making Jinto a minor prince. His title is his saving grace in more ways than one...\\nStory~7\\nI can only judge the show based on this particular season without any bias from its\\' many sequels. This anime more or less always starts off with a 1-2 minute pre-intro in Abh language. It is a totally made up language, and dub or sub, I never got any translations. We have to use our imaginations for this part. Then the intro starts playing and it goes back into regular Japanese or whatever dubbed language it was supposed to be in. The anime has a major plot, with 3 main subplots that take up the entire 13 episodes. In my opinion, the 2nd arc was a bit lackluster, but it probably was put in to show the versatility/creativity of the characters. Still, it was just a three episode burnout, which is only really important for those who wish to complete the other sequels.\\nArt~9\\nThe art was great for an anime in the “despised era” of the 90’s and early 2000’s; a time many people try to specifically avoid because the art style is too old. It is actually done very well, and depict the scenes of space and some of its inhabitants on other planets pretty well. It does use some of the cliché’s, like the cliché for women to wear short clothes, but main characters usually have a full-body suit. The \"humans\" are also drawn more feral, in an attempt to make the Abh look even better. The ships are the standard many space operas have used. The attention to detail was also an important aspect of the art for the anime, with even background depictions surpassing many anime of its time.\\nSound~8\\nThe sound is excellent. The music really sets the scene and helps with the tone of the show. The space fights are better than many other space operas, such as Outlaw Star. The speech of the characters is varied a lot, helping set the mood of the nobility, where different people use different dialects. An important “sound” is that important “Abh speak”. It helps create the idea that the Abh really are a different species altogether with their own language and customs. Other than that, the opening and ending themes are very memorable.\\nCharacters~8\\nThe characters really make the show. Jinto is from a planet resembling Earth, so his character is easier for the audience to connect to. This is in contrast with the space princess Lafiel, which makes the audience want to get to know her better, because of her royal blood, but desire for military prowess. The characters are all well developed, though some names might be harder to remember, because they are Abh of course. The only reason I didn’t give the characters a 10 is because of that one arc I didn’t enjoy all that much, mainly dealing with a baron of the Abh Empire. He was still a good character, but I felt that it would have been better if he didn’t have a whole arc to himself. The characters and their behavior still pave the path to understanding the Abh people. This is contributed by the depth of the characters, and their beliefs.\\nEnjoyment~10\\nAgain, this is a must see for space opera fans. The entire Seikai series does an outstanding job of depicting a space age saga, probably comparable to the legendary Uchuu Senkan Yamato. I really did not expect to enjoy this anime so much, but the story was great, the characters even better, and just the idea of an interstellar romance was enough to draw me in. It is a great series that I would recommend to everyone. It was immediately added to favorites after completing it, because it was the building block for an even greater experience with the other series.\\nOverall~9\\nSince I still want to try to be objective, I’ll give it an 8.5-9. There were some things that could have been done better to make it a greater show, but there\\'s no point in debating what could have been. It is a great anime that is worth everyone’s time and is easily a timeless 90’s space opera classic. If you must, just skip the first 2 minutes if the Abh speak confuses you too much. I don’t recommend it, but there were some times I just could not fathom what they were saying.

Our protagonist Lin Jinto seems to have suffered some injuries from the war and wants to take a break from the fighting. Our other lead, Lafiel the Abh (also Jinto\\'s girlfriend by this time), decides to join him. Jinto is an ordinary human appointed as head of his conquered homeworld by the Abh overlords due to hereditary circumstances, and Lafiel is a member of the Abh royalty, one of many individuals directly in line for succession of the throne. Jinto\\'s homeworld Martine is vying for independence from Abh rule, and at the heart of this movement is Teal Clint, incidentally a close confidante of Jinto\\'s now-deceased family. This is the backdrop in which this roughly hour-long OVA begins.\\nFor much of this brief show, Jinto revisits old places and old acquaintances. Everywhere he goes, his well-wishers try to stuff some sense into him, to no avail. Jinto is convinced that what he is doing is for the best. The show also reveals the final clincher about the Abh that should leave no doubt in anyone\\'s mind about just how sinister the whole setup had been all along. And in the face of all this, the show puts up a loving, smiling face - as though it just treated you to the most wonderful developments ever.\\nNow, I\\'ve reviewed the first two installments without having to drop any spoilers, but here it\\'s simply impossible to criticise the show without getting into plot specifics, because not only is it here that it indulges in its worst ever dishonesty, but it\\'s actually far worse than the previous installments, and stoops to a level so low that it needs to be explicitly pointed out to be appreciated. With that in mind:\\n----SPOILERS FOLLOW----\\nFirst he meets his old childhood friend Que Durin (the sole friend who saw him off to Abh country in the first series, if you recall), offering him a post where he can assist Jinto with various administrative matters. When they meet at his place to sort out the details, Durin confesses his reason to distrust the Abh in what is a stakes-changing shocker of a revelation  - to eliminate the possiblity of revolt or in-fighting, the Abh are genetically hard-wired never to be able to turn on their superiors, and despite any possible grudges or resentment find it practically impossible to disobey orders (the phrase \"I was only following orders!\" gets taken to a whole new level of creepy...). Jinto himself reveals the final piece of this puzzle - which is that by mandate of Imperial Law, any ethnic Terran (i.e. ordinary human) members of the Abh nobility are only allowed to conceive genetically-modified children who would be physically full-fledged Abh - blue hair, body implants and all. The picture that emerges is a system where everyone born into nobility (and therefore important positions of power) are blue-chipped humanoids who have more in common with a random Abh than with their own parent, and effectively no free will....this is even worse than I could have ever imagined. I\\'m simply at a loss for words here. And it\\'s no coincidence that this vital piece of information was withheld until the very end of this franchise. But the even more horrifying part is that the show makes his apprehensions out to be ultimately unfounded, and that it\\'s precisely these qualities that actually make the Abh GREAT. Give that a minute to sink in.\\nIn the middle of all this, there is an even more crucial development. Jinto\\'s home planet Martine has been vying for independence from Abh rule (and the show has the bloody audacity to refer to the Independence party as the \"Feudal government\"). The Abh retailate by destroying their planetary defenses under the pretext of a drill-exercise goof-up due to miscommunications. And then - here\\'s the singular worst part - the blame is shifted on the Independence party for forcing the Abh\\'s hand, and they are accused of \"coercing the dissenters into submission\" by activating the defense system and thereby forcing everyone to get on board with the independence movement because there\\'s \"no turning back now\". \"No civilised person with a decent undertsanding of the galaxy would do this - these are the ignorant actions of an isolated Lander\" is how an Abh conveniently puts it. The show tries to suggest that only ignorant and misguided individuals would want to try and seek independence from a forcefully-occupying power that they never wanted any part of in the first place. It also implicitly suggests the most singularly bald-faced lie ever, which is that the majority of the population would NOT want independence from such an invading/occupying force, because of which one would have to resort to such underhanded measures to get the population on board...I can no longer help myself here, I just need to vent out that this is singularly the most shameful, two-faced and obscene notion that this show has so far hurled at me.\\nAnyways, things being what they are, Jinto decides to do damage control and visit Teal Clint - who is the acting Prime Minister at the helm of the independence movement. A decent man, an honourable man, someone with spine to stand up to the Abh. Someone who saved Jinto\\'s hyde (sorry about the pun) when his very life was at risk. Jinto ought to be grateful to this guy. And also to his wife Lena who doted on him as a child and went just as much out of her way to make sure he was safe. Instead, he has chosen to side himself against the very people who saved his life (whereas the show makes it out that it\\'s the Abh whom he owes his loyalties to). But the two don\\'t care about any of that right now, they just want to see their boy again - such is the love they have for him. The most heart-wrenching part for me was when Jinto replies that he has responsibilities now, to which Lena tearfully retorts, \"Responsibilities as an Abh? As an Invader?\" She speaks for all decent individuals with that line. Anyhow, Jinto agrees to visit, and they are tearfully overjoyed to see him alive and well - and desperate, Clint suggests what I personally had been practically yelling all along (in my review of Banner of the Stars I, if you recall) - give up the Abh title and return home clean by seeking political asylum. The Martinian people would have understood - the title was forced upon him when he was too young to consent, and he was personally not guilty of any wrongdoing at the time.\\nBut it is here that the show gives its singularly most insincere pretext in the entire series so far for Jinto to side with the Abh hegemony, and moreover for Clint to give up on independence - if Jinto steps down, any other person appointed in his place will \"not be so generous\", and so a war might break out, putting Martine\\'s very existence at stake. I might even have agreed with that stand (on a strictly short-term and tactical basis, mind you) if Jinto was portrayed as being CRITICAL of the Abh at heart but just playing along so that his homeland can have a future, but it\\'s abundantly clear that he has been completely bought into the Abh way, and is very much in line with their program (there is a telling scene right before that meeting where Lafiel tells him, \"This is Your battleground\"...). This is where I think that the rationale is deeply insincere and two-faced - it seeks to present Jinto as a neutral and unbiased player in the game when in fact he is anything but, and thus give more credibility to that line of argument. And in any case, just by taking such a stand, Jinto has all but explicitly incriminated the Abh to be coercive thugs ruling with a velvet glove covering an iron fist. But does the show even acknowledge this? Nope. It diverts your attention to how Jinto feels sad at no longer being allowed to return to the forests and the beautiful landscapes of his homeworld, but it pales in comparison to the peerless, radiant beauty...of Lafiel. \"Life\\'s too short to live in depression and regret\", the show croons. How sweet, how romantic....someone please kill me right now, I can\\'t take any more of this. And as if in answer to my prayers, the show ends, right there.\\n----SPOILERS END-----\\nUltimately, the show actually voices legitimate criticisms of its own premise through these two associates of Jinto, but then covers over them with the most shamefully insincere rationalisations. The blame is shifted on those who refuse to go along with the Abh hegemony, as always. Even at best, the scenario is portrayed as an unfortunate or unavoidable outcome of unfavourable circumstances when in fact the Abh are completely to blame for what has happened. And all of this is glossed over very expediently, and the focus very quickly shifts to some other issue before you realize anything is amiss - and in this department, Banner III operates far more slickly than its predecessors. Come to think of it, the only reason for this made-on-the-quick OVA to exist seems to have been to coyly deflect the most threatening of legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against the show\\'s basic premise.\\nSo...back to Earth - Banner of the Stars III does end on a tragic note, all right. It is the tragic end to all human freedom, not just Jinto\\'s privilege to visit the planet that he unilaterally lords over. But who cares, because he is ensconced in the sweet and caring arms of the most beautiful, wonderful Abh princess, for the rest of his boot-kissing life. And the Abh will take over all planets (because that is their \"destiny\", and one they themselves daren\\'t question) and thus finally bring about lasting peace to all of mankind. The End. Seriously, am I the only one here who needs to throw up?\\nAnyhow, it\\'s getting late now - here\\'s my final verdict on the entire Stars franchise: the Stars aka Seikai series isn\\'t Love in the Time of Cholera - it might as well be called Love Cholera. Fans of good Space Opera ought to look elsewhere - the appearance of intriguing political complexity  was an elaborate facade to intellectually overwhelm more casual viewers into passively accepting something they would otherwise have puked at. Fans of good romance ought to look elsewhere - all the coy romance between the two leads takes place whenever the show needs to blindside you to the utter and complete hypocrisy of their interactions with the outside world.\\nHeck, fans of good Sci-fi should look elsewhere, because what actually seemed like a genuinely intriguing and promising sci-fi concept about (seemingly) progressive-minded genetically-modified space-faring humans, turned out to be so creepily monstrous and subversive that it makes even the most depraved eugenic ideologies of the past seem tame by comparison. If you look at it closely, its premise is actually closer to those presented in classic dystopic literature - except here it\\'s presented as something wonderful rather than horrible. Its status as something of a \"classic\" among old-school anime circles is, IMO, an unfortunate case of people being taken in by its serenely operatic atmosphere and its fairly engaging and believable character dynamics, and failing to see that it\\'s all in the service of some especially sick and reprehensible ideas. The people who made this show ought to hang their heads in shame. Seriously.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '81f82cc207446fa4c79711fc621ad0a4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I just finished watching Samurai Champloo, and a few things come to mind. One, I originally watched the series because of a profound enjoyment of Shinichiro Watanabe\\'s other directorial effort, Cowboy Bebop. On the surface, Champloo seems a lot like Bebop - a stylized fantasy view of a typical genre mixed with a contemporary and unique soundtrack.\\nFor Watanabe\\'s shows, music plays a vital role in expressing the atmosphere and character of the setting, and is very much a character in and of itself. Such was the case in Cowboy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo attempts to do the same. Only, this time, Champloo comes short of\\nBebop\\'s example, and fails in a few ways.\\nStory: This is the story of three wanderers who meet up and join forces to search for a \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\". I won\\'t give away much here, but I found the plot to be incredibly disjointed and hollow. The only real antagonists make themselves known within the last 6 or so episodes of the series, and most of the preceding episodes are pretty much filler. This is a series that could have benefitted from a shortening in length to perhaps 13 episodes to preserve plot integrity. The last handful of episodes redeem the plot somewhat, but a handful of awesome doesn\\'t quite make up for the bucketful of yawns that precede it.\\nArt: I found the artwork in Samurai Champloo to be pretty good as a whole. The swordfighting scenes specifically are fantastic, and motion is fluid and exciting, particularly when Mugen fights someone. Thumbs up here.\\nSound: As mentioned before, Watanabe\\'s previous work, Cowboy Bebop, successfully married jazz music with sic-fi to create something altogether unique and creative. Champloo attempts to do the same with samurai and hip-hop, but the end result doesn\\'t impress as much as one would think. A much better effect could be had by just watching the fight scenes of this show while playing a Wu-Tang CD. Sometimes the music does not fit the scene, and sometimes the music for a dramatic scene is a bit too subtle. Hip hop as a genre really shouldn\\'t be subtle, and the high hopes promised by the opening theme are not lived up to by the background music. Also, should the ending theme have been a sappy J-pop song? If you were gonna do the whole hip hop thing, go the whole way.\\nCharacter: The three main characters are interesting, but I cannot give too high a score here because there really isn\\'t a lot of development of any antagonists. All of the character-moments of the series involve the three heroes, and while they are fairly developed, it seems as though some questions are left unanswered. Each main character had a serviceable background story, but their pasts seemed glossed over a bit. Some funny moments are had at the expense of Mugen particularly, and the different natures of the protagonists lead to some memorable scenes. However, as I mentioned before, these characters are the ONLY ones that are developed. Some characters appear for an episode or two and are never explained or developed in the time that they\\'re there (the secret policeman comes to mind)\\nEnjoyment: After all the nitpicking, I enjoyed the series, mostly because of the few awesome tense moments and the sword fighting. This series has a lot of flaws, and is overall a disappointment for those expecting another Cowboy Bebop, but low expectations and a taste for fluid fight choreography can garner a good bit of enjoyment out of this series.\\nOverall: I\\'d say rewatchability is about medium. I wouldn\\'t mind watching some of the major fights again, but unlike Cowboy Bebop, there are definitely skippable episodes upon rewatching for this show. Although enjoyable, Watanabe van do better - which leaves me still searching for the perfect samurai anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5aaf4bc17bccccb86dff63142b04c66b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'one of the things i missed most about living in the usa is watching anime on [adult swim] every night. hell, i remember all the times i spent staying up until 3am watching episodes of inuyasha and cowboy bebop when i should\\'ve been sleeping because i had class in the morning. but if there\\'s one anime that i remember fondly, it\\'s samurai champloo. i don\\'t want to be \"that guy\" who says that the ost is what i remember the most, but that\\'s definitely what first comes to mind.\\ni remember back in 2004/2005 when i was still attending high school and there was this massive\\nhip-hop and reggaeton craze that swept pretty much every corner of the united states (and even my home country of india, since it seemed that virtually all bhangra music seemed to have a rap/hip-hop twist to it). samurai champloo started airing around this time period and i remember it so well because of all the promotional adverts on [adult swim] which featured that instrumental hip-hop soundtrack.\\nconsidering the fact that i was an impressionable teenager at the time who had nothing but 50 cent and eminem songs on his ipod mini, it was no surprise that i loved the hell out of this show. but looking back, i liked it for the wrong reasons. yes, the soundtrack is odd and yet works extremely well for a show with this kind of style. but there are many other reasons to like this show which i ended up finding out upon re-visiting this programme after 8-9 years. of course, i also found many reasons to criticise this programme as well but let\\'s cross that bridge when we get to it.\\nat its core, samurai champloo can be viewed as cowboy bebop\\'s younger brother. it\\'s brash, impulsive, doesn\\'t always make the right decisions and sometimes mimics its older brother much to our annoyance but we still love it anyway. unlike cowboy bebop, samurai champloo is much less serious. come to think of it, there weren\\'t many serious episodes at all. episodes tend to vary between being action-centric and comedy-centric. unfortunately, this leads to quite a few problems.\\ncowboy bebop\\'s biggest shortcoming is the fact that it\\'s episodic in nature, and samurai champloo opts for a similar approach. however, it does have *some* semblance of a plot. the goal of mugen, jin, and fuu is to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers (which STILL sounds like a ridiculous name almost a decade later). the episodic nature is thus forgiveable since the show focuses more on the journey rather than destination itself. but it isn\\'t all good.\\ni said before that shows of episodic nature tend to suffer from this problem of having episodes that vary wildly in terms of quality and that\\'s further exacerbated in this show. considering the fact that it varies between being action-centric and comedy-centric, there exists a drastic margin of error. i\\'m biased toward the action episodes rather than the comedy episodes since some comedy episodes like the one which involved baseball (yes. that actually happened) were just plain average while other episodes like the one where there\\'s a graffiti battle between two gangs and mugen learns how to read (yes, that actually happened) were fucking hilarious.\\nthe action episodes are of particular note since it gets to showcase the absolutely gorgeous art and animation that champloo has. since the backgrounds moved in real time, the sword fights were intense as all hell. couple that with mugen\\'s unorthodox fighting style and some rather bizarre scenarios that led to some intense fights, and you\\'ve got a happy desi anime nerd. speaking of art/animation, manglobe did a spectacular job animating this series. everything looks absolutely gorgeous and despite coming out in 2004, this holds up amazingly well 10+ years later (although some characters\\' faces tended to go off model from time to time, especially in shots that were at a small distance).\\nnow with that said, let\\'s go back to the characters. unlike bebop, we aren\\'t really given much in the way of recurring characters so we\\'re pretty much stuck with mugen, jin, and fuu for the entire run. unfortunately, they pretty much remain static throughout the course of the show. i mean, mugen and jin start out wanting to kill each other and over time, they actually tolerate one another but that\\'s about it. as for fuu, she is quite literally useless. the only purpose she serves is being a walking plot device. oh, and being a generic damsel in distress. mugen and jin on the other hand are pretty damn likeable but sometimes it feels like they rely too much on their \"gimmicks\" (what with mugen being a vulgar, illiterate break-dancing swordsman and jin being a reserved ronin with an extremely orthodox fighting style). other than that, not much to complain about here.\\nnow we get to my favourite part of champloo: the audio. put it short, samurai champloo is basically flawless in this section. i know so many people who hate rap and hip-hop, and yet love the everliving shit out of this show. also, despite comprising of predominantly hip-hop music, the show does a good job of not shoving it in your face (most of the time). the background music consists of amazing instrumental hip-hop tracks done by the likes of nujabes (may he rest in peace), fat jon, and forces of nature and i must say that i wish these three did more anime soundtracks, but i guess that\\'s too late now.\\nthe dub is also really good stuff, but that\\'s no surprise since this is bebop\\'s little brother. steve blum does an excellent job voicing mugen (although his voice work did remind me a bit too much of spike spiegel from time to time) as did kirk thornton as jin. i really don\\'t understand why some people give this dub shit since it\\'s pretty damn good. can you really go wrong by a dub done by funimation (or was it geneon? i keep forgetting who licensed this show when)?\\non the whole, samurai champloo isn\\'t perfect and in many ways, i can see why people would give this show crap. at the same time, it definitely has quite a few merits to stand on. say what you will about this show being a carbon copy of bebop, but there\\'s one thing that this show has that bebop will never have: its style. going back to that little brother analogy, it does borrow quite a bit from its predecessor, but they are ultimately two totally different shows. if you\\'re in the mood for something with a lot of entertainment value you\\'ll surely remember for a long time, i cannot recommend this show enough. in fact, i highly recommend buying it on blu-ray (provided you have the means to watch something on blu-ray). some shows simply \"take\" to blu-ray with no two ways around it and champloo is one of them.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b98aa6e63d9223cbabc5886b8f678a56'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The anime was created by Manglobe and directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, the man who directed Cowboy Bebop, another critically acclaimed series. Watanabe is known for his style of mixing different concepts together which he did brilliantly in Samurai Champloo, blending together elements of hip-hop, a Edo Japan setting and a lot of modern day references, true historical events and characters.\\nThe story features 3 main characters. Fuu, a girl who is on a quest to find \"the samurai that smells of sunflowers\". Mugen, one of the samurai Fuu saved, a carefree vagabond and anti-hero with a break dance/capoeira fighting style, who doesn\\'t really care about anything\\nother than fighting. And Jin, a ronin with a conventional samurai behavior and a traditionalfighting style who has a dark past that haunts him. The three meet in Fuu\\'s hometown where the samurai duo helps her in a stress situation with the local samurai band,but soon finds themselves ready for execution for killing the magistrate\\'s son. Fuu then steps in and returns the favor and the three take off to a journey to find \"the samurai that smells of sunflowers\" that Fuu is desperately searching for.\\nThe animation in the anime is great, and i really enjoyed it. It looks like a mix of graffiti art and old school manga which is done by implying thick lines and a bit strange color scheme. Intense battle scenes start at the very beginning and don\\'t stop till the story ends. The way Mugen moves and fights is really refreshing in the genre, and I enjoyed watching his fight, but don\\'t think that the Jin battles are boring, fans of kenjutsu will love him as he is one bad ass sword fighter.\\nCharacters are fun and very easy to attach too. There is the girl, the bad boy, and the stoic bushido all tied together in one hell of a ride. Main char development is something I point out as the flaw of the show, as i have the feeling it could have been done better and in more detail. Every episode has some side characters which are always refreshing and you don\\'t get that feeling that the developers are just recycling old ideas, or getting fed up of doing the series, which i sometimes get when watching a show.\\nThe music theme is somewhat not standard for an anime series, as it is hip hop themed, and despite not being a fan of the genre I found it refreshing and interesting. It also went along with the whole gangstarish feeling they gave to some characters and settings. Moments of a more traditional approach with a Japanese sound flow perfectly and really give a deeper feeling to the scene. It is one of the shows that I can say the music deserves to be praised as its best part, which gets even more weight when I say that all the other aspects are top quality as well.\\nThis is a great show and the feeling it leaves after you have watched it is that the time was certainly not a waste of time. It has its moments of serious and the comic part which go well with one another and keep you entertained for a 26 episode period. Samurai and hip hop lovers as well as action lovers will highly enjoy Samurai Champloo, but others should pick it up as well because of its interesting and original story, the humorous elements which are hilarious,  fighting scenes you will like even if you are not an action fan, and truly a great overall watching experience. I would recommend it to any true anime lover, just don\\'t expect the nacama, friend power shonen part as this is not a generic shonen, and if you are still in a phase that you HIGHLY ENJOY Bleach, Naruto and such titles you should not watch this and ruin the joy you would have if you watched it at the right time(I still watch shonen and find it fun but I do not HIGHLY ENJOY them, there is a difference).', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '64444d952018c704fc646f38522f9c78'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Samurai Champloo is a funky train. It\\'s gonna take you up and down, all over a parallel Edo period Japan.\\nThe train conductors? Two extremely skilled swordmen, two completely different styles. There\\'s Mugen. A loud, rather simple man, with a more unorthodox fighting style. There\\'s Jin, the refined, quiet type, closer to your idea of a samurai who earns the respect of others. Both of them have to carry their own weight; be it that of coming from a tough place, or that of being too skillful for others to stand it. Ah, there\\'s Fuu too. She\\'s there, being all cutesy and stuff with her\\n``Mo!`` \\'s and ``Uso!`` \\'s. Don\\'t you dare look down on her though. She is the link that holds this chain of unlikely travellers together, after all. And well, you\\'ve seen a lot of girls with huge appettites in anime before, but this one WILL turn fat after eating a lot. Her desire to find ``The samurai that smells of sunflowers`` was what gave the reason for their journey to begin. And what a journey it was.\\nIt\\'s the little things that made Samurai Champloo special to my eyes. A little touch of realism, where actually our characters more than often do have to worry about things often skipped as trivial; like having to earn money for food and lodgings. How the creators constantly turn on the style. How the characters move so smoothly, the fights are quite a treat with the fluid motions and the polished choreography.\\nI was a bit doubtful about the suitability of this music genre for a story about samurai. Needless to say, I found it hard to skip the opening theme after a while. It is one of those little somethings that add to the charm of the show. Same goes for the ending theme, earning you a bit of nostalgia as it sees you off, before you hop onto this train again, heading for the next station. Through out the show the music is just so good. Be it gritty, chill out tunes, or hauntingly sad songs like Obokuri Eemui.\\nWhat is there not to like in Samurai Champloo? Well... Most \"arcs\" are two episodes long, at the most. There\\'s no typical structured built up, where a group of powerful villains exists, and everything seems to lead to the final confrontation with them. Mugen is a streetwise antihero himself anyway, slashing officials without a second thought if they happen to get in his way. It\\'s understandable that not everyone finds this approach appealing. For the rest, travelling with two strangers in pursuit of something as vague as ``the samurai who smells of sunflowers``? It\\'s enough reason in itself. Here it\\'s all about the journey. The places you see, the people you meet, the things you taste.\\nSo the three travellers will traverse Japan for a clue on the man that Fuu has to find. They\\'ll work, steal and fight for a taste of the local delicacies, Fuu will momentarily turn chubby when she overdoes it. What about the people they meet? Any memorable journey requires a sequence of meetings with extraordinary persons. Our trio will meet a Dutch man searching for..something different. A housewife whose beauty radiates too brightly to be blurred by her husband\\'s failures. The troubled young men who take the wrong path in life and, cruel as it might be,  have to pay. Lethal, beautiful women. Your occasional powerful opponents. More lethal women. And umm..remember the forementioned realism? Scratch that when you witness a tribute to the zombie culture; or when eager..US navy officers choose as the deciding factor for the invasion of Japanese coasts a game of..ninja baseball, quick to turn into a massacre; finally, keep an eye for the references and the various legends making cameo appearances in a Forrest Gump-ish manner.\\nStill, there\\'s an end to everything, and eventually for their journey to be meaningful, they\\'ll have to find ``the samurai that smells of sunflowers``. After each of the three travellers takes care of what they have to, this train can briefly stop.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Substance over style, style over substance? Pretty visuals, or powerful plots? Glamorous production, or memorable themes? Sometimes it feels like writers and producers often ask themselves this question as a way of deciding what part of the show to sacrifice in service for another—a tightly written, genuinely complex narrative or brilliant visuals, dizzying cinematography and a high-flown music backing? Sometimes as a viewer it feels like we have to ask ourselves the same question—what I just watched, did I enjoy it superficially or was it something deeper than that? Why does one matter more than the other? Sometimes I have to ask myself if I\\nsimply liked the way a show looked, or did it affect me on a more personal, genuine level?\\nBut sometimes I’m left asking myself... was it both?\\nSamurai Champloo is one of these rare, no-compromise, all-inclusive anime experiences that leaves you feeling every conceivable emotion. It leaves you feeling warm because of its sincere themes, it leaves you inspired by the gorgeous, vivid visuals and it leaves you entranced by the dazzling soundtrack. It’s a show that you can enjoy in any capacity, in any mood, and under any lens. Do you like audiovisuals? Do you like action? Poignancy? Romance? Satire? It’s all there. If there was ever a show to embody the concept of universal enjoyment, in theory Samurai Champloo would be it.\\nA show can only go as far as its characters, so how far does Samurai Champloo go? The three main cast members were all treated fairly (although admittedly Mugen was given more treatment, being the main, main character) and they all had contrasting personalities. It\\'s hands down one of the best use of character foils I\\'ve personally seen in anime; Mugen the big-mouthed and rogue criminal; Jin, the ice-cool and disciplined ronin; and Fuu, the brave yet petite teenager. Each of the characters are polar opposites of one another and because their personalities are written so consistently, their interactions are spectacularly entertaining to watch. The fashion in which they all bounce thoughts, dialogue and emotion off of one another is always enjoyable, but most importantly, natural as well. While as an anime emotions are dragged out and overplayed, it still feels oddly authentic—the characters are always true to how they are written so it never feels superficial.\\nFollowing the characters was the plot; it was kept simple: look for the “sunflower samurai” and in the process embark on an action-packed, treacherous adventure of smiles, laughter, tears and blood. The core theme of the narrative is the notion that the journeys we travel in life are more often than not more enjoyable and important than the destination or goal we arrive at. The emphasis is on important, because, if our trio of a cast simply found the Sunflower Samurai without their arduous journey, none of them would have progressed as characters like they did in the original story.\\nThis is truly a special theme because of how easily it can be extrapolated to our lives—we all have dreams, ambitions and aspirations that we one day hope to achieve and while we fantasize and drool over the thoughts of achieving them, more often than not it won’t be the end goal itself that will give us the gratification. No, it’s something much more deep and sincere than that—it’s the shaky, uncertain path that you took to get there. The work, the emotions, the doubts, the failures, the small successes, everything that made reaching the end goal seem so impossible and difficult, that is what is truly gratifying. And like the show conveys to you… sometimes the end goal itself isn’t that special after all, and what is actually valuable, and what you actually take away from that long, exhausting journey… is the journey itself.\\nIn terms of format, Samurai Champloo is episodic, and it uses that format to its advantage. By making it very obvious that the events in each episode were self-contained tales, the show was able to drastically change its tone from suspense, action, poignancy, etc. without seeming jarring. It was able to tell tales of heartbreak, tales of redemption, tales of hilarity, all without seeming like it didn\\'t know what it wanted to be, and in the process take you on a roller coaster of emotions that leave a lasting mark.\\nThe soundtrack of Samurai Champloo is phenomenal. It’s the part of the audiovisual experience that has to be addressed.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Alright this is the first review I've ever written so sorry if it's not the best quality.\\nHope this helps you if you're planning on watching this show.\\nStory: 5\\nNow honestly i was pretty disappointed by Champloo's story, you see I'm a massive fan of Watanabes most popular work 'Cowboy Bebop' and I expected this story to be of similiar quality as it is held in the same high regard but considered 'heavily underrated' compared to Bebop but that is completely false. Firstly this show is mainly episodic which could have worked in it's favour as Cowboy Bebop was mainly episodic and amazing but Champloo's\\nattemp just falls flat with boring predictable plots and when there is a story that overlaps across episodes it just feels long and dull. The pacing isn't terrible but can feel awkward as well due to the fact that you don't really have a great anticipation for the story conclusion as there isn't really an overarching plot.\\nArt: 7\\nNow the art was pretty solid overall relative to when this show was released. Now I do think it possibly has some of the weakest animation in a Watanabe directed show but thats's mainly because Watanabe's other creations are just so interesting and defined in their art-styles. The animation during action scenes is very fluid and the dark gritty style works heavily in Champloo's favour.\\nSound: 7\\nNow the soundtrack is probably one of the best parts of this show as it was done by the popular lofi-hiphop-esque producer Nujabes. The smooth jazz-rap builds on the action packed parts of this show and create a really chill vibe for watching. The opening and ending are also great and very memorable parts of the show.\\nCharacter: 4\\nThe characters were also extremely disappointing and one faced in their personalities.\\nMugen was the typical excited, rowdy main character who is always ready for some action and kind of felt like a ripoff of Spike but minus the depth and development. Jin was the silent, Sasuke type and Fuu was basically an irritating tsundere type. The side characters were sometimes interesting but lacked development due to most stories only lasting one episode in the series.\\nEnjoyment: 4\\nSome may think I'm biased in some way from my review of this show but honestly I love anime and samurais as much as the next man but this whole show just wasn't interesting at all to me and everytime I watched an episode it felt forced and long.\\nOverall: 4\\nOverall i really didn't enjoy this show and my expectations were crushed in a mere few episodes.\\nI think this show mainly suffers from the community's overrating nature and it's dull way of playing out mini-stories within a decent length show. I really wanted to like this show but my experience watching this show felt long and boring.\\nI hope this review helped you out in someway, thanks :)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '118d2e661be0242e29471df8d18de74c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"There are some stories which would take you to another world, it feels as if the scenes are replaying in your memory constantly even after you have completed it. Samurai Champloo is one such series.\\nHere I'll write a short review on why you should watch Samurai Champloo and why is it so much worth.\\nAlready you must have read countless amount reviews praising the series, but then why isn't it as popular as cowboy bebop?\\nThat's because this series has 26 episodes of content and story is episodic in nature, there isn't any driving plot to the final conclusion or ending. While cowboy bebop is\\nfast paced, has more characters compared to Samurai Champloo and also has more story and the ending is devastating stealing the hearts.\\nBut the thing is, what makes this series one of the epics in adventure type stories is that you don't know what's going on in character's mind, all you know is what they speak. It makes you guess the character's mind and way of thinking. You actually become one among them.\\nThroughout the series, you will encounter various stories about how people struggled in earlier days, how people were tricked, how gangs emergerd, wars begun, oppression in society, prostitution and you also come to know even among all these there are people who are generous and willing to help a stranger.\\nThe soundtracks are good, some people might like it, some might not.\\nArt is top notch, fights are badass, Character development might not be good is what you think, but that's what is unique in this series, you think like them, you cheer for them, you cry with them. Its as if you were one among them. What I found most intriguing is that most of the stories felt realistic which lacks most in almost all anime..\\nAt the end of the day, you will be left with a feeling, why has the journey stopped so quickly? couldn't' it have been forever? what is left of me? Where should I be going now? Should I cry and tell everyone to go on a new journey? All these thoughts would be haunting you for a long time.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I first watched some of Samurai Champloo as a child through the dub (I do not recommend, as in go for the subs instead). Of course it was when I was in very early middle school and that wasn\\'t a good thing, but the good side of that is that I found it \"boring.\" Anyway, fast-forward to around 2012, I decided to try finishing Samurai Champloo. Of course, I really did finish, and I ended up feeling empty inside. Why? I felt like I lost three good friends, and gosh... it was a melancholic feeling and I still remember it from time to time.\\nStory: The\\nplot of this series is just amazing because it is not your typical samurai anime- it just isn\\'t. It is an anime with an actual noticeable, yet small amount of slice of life included. There are moral questions that show up all the time. A realistic-like adventure (that also has goofiness) with three colorful friends. Our topic, Samurai Champloo, follows Fuu, a 15 year old girl who lost her mother. Yes that sounds very overused, but this isn\\'t done shallowly at all in this show, and I kid you not. It\\'s heartbreaking when you find out what lead to her death when you think about it. Anyway, Fuu was working at her relatives\\' shop, when Mugen shows up. Mugen, being one who likes fighting opponents stronger than him, instantly wanted to kill Jin, another one of our trio, when he appeared at the shop. This all happened because of an egocentric father-son duo.\\nChamploo is an action show, with the large element of traveling through Japan, which is based on a fictionalized and real mix of the Edo era with other elements mixed in. The most central point of the story which is the goal of Fuu our heroine, is to find the \"sunflower samurai,\" who she doesn\\'t where to find. Mugen and Jin, being in her debt, had to promise and accompany her, and find this samurai.\\nNow, keep in mind, as amazing as this anime is, it\\'s a mature rated anime as I mentioned earlier. How so? I was 18 when I watched this, and I found the element of brothels and prostitutes, included with the fact that Mugen is a womanizer, and Jin who would accompany him to red districts difficult for me to watch at times. However, it\\'s not anything so explicit that it takes away from the show. So if you\\'re not one comfortable with these kinds of things or you\\'re a preteen, maybe you shouldn\\'t pick this up. HOWEVER, that is up to you. If anything I highly recommend to watch this show years later if you\\'re not around 18 or so. Now if this was an anime where brothels were centuries out of use, and this sort of thing was going on, I\\'d be saying really different things. Anyway, onto the art we go.\\nArt: The art of Champloo is somewhat inconsistent. At times it\\'ll look really smooth, other times, it\\'ll seem like an early 90\\'s anime quality, gritty lines, pretty low quality. It ranges from great art, to below average. However, overall the art is still quite good. The animation is well-done, fight scenes are great, and movements quick and smooth. When the animators did so, some scenes are very dramatic and suspenseful, the colors being perfect for a scene. The effects used are also done very well, and they\\'re definitely not plain; big props to good effects that aren\\'t overkill or boring. Regardless of a few downgrades near the first episodes, the art still passes well.\\nSound: Samurai Champloo\\'s sound is one of the most noteworthy. You only have to start this anime once and you\\'ll find multiple very memorable tracks. This mostly refers to the bgm courtesy of Nujabes, Tsutchie, Force of Nature, and many more artists. A WIDE variety of composers and singers took part in the soundtrack, and that is no joke. MINMI, who did an excellent job on two endings, Kazami for a great English ending, Midicronica for another notable ending, and there are even Japanese folk songs that have an important part in the show. The music is amazing, and sets the mood for Champloo just so well. The songs can be moving, relaxing, or ominous. The sound for this series is leveled with its story. To add, the voice acting for this series is very spot-on. Our main cast\\'s voices match so well with our characters, you\\'d think that they\\'re the same person or something of the like. All in all, superb sound for this series.\\nCharacter: Beware of some spoilers here! Here, the character descriptions get longer and longer as the farther you get, the more I talk about character relations with one another.\\nThe three main characters, Fuu, Mugen, and Jin.\\nFuu, the petite 15 year old with a monstrous appetite, who is cheery and a hard worker when she needs to be. She can be lazy, a liar, many things and isn\\'t exactly very womanly, but she\\'s feminine, has a good sense of justice, and is very determined to reach her goal. In truth,  she is actually very considerate. Regardless of what most characters see of her, there are many deeper sides to her, and she has had a tragic past, even if that doesn\\'t show up all the time. An adorable, seemingly upbeat girl, who is a pretty strong female lead.\\nMugen is the crude, fighting-obsessed, lazy, violent, women-chasing, in your face dishonest one of the trio. He\\'s rough, on the mean side, and seems completely selfish. Below the surface, he has some loyalty, and does care about his friends, as much as they would doubt that. Regardless of his many negative and infamous traits, he develops friendship with the other two. He grows attached to them, and cares for them, something he would never admit. There\\'s a good amount of character growth that he went through in the series. Like Fuu, he also had a tragic past, leading to how he is who he is today. Mugen does not get along with Fuu, who he calls flat-chested, fat, and other things. Fuu finds him lazy, crude, and untrustworthy. Through time, they learn to worry about one another, and share a bond.\\nJin is the silent, seemingly typical \"good-looking\" glasses one. He\\'s very quiet and reserved. A very skilled samurai on Mugen\\'s level, but they\\'re complete opposites personality-wise. Jin has a sense of morals, and fights because he learned, and does it through prediction and sheer speed. Mugen would fight him with impulsive moves, kicks, and even some break-dancing. Jin and Mugen do NOT get along in the beginning. What\\'s Fuu to do when her two bodyguards are total opposites? It\\'s more than enough when they fight antagonists, only to say they\\'re alive because they want to kill each other. Yet, these two opposites become friends. Respecting each other, believing each other, and relating to one another. Of course, they would never admit that. Jin follows the others with a tragic past as well, one that pretty much haunts him throughout most of their journey. Because of his quiet trait, the talkative Fuu can\\'t really interact with him at first. Later on, they both get to know each other better, and so Fuu would become sad at a certain part of our story, when Jin abruptly says that he may leave the trio.\\nThese three strangers, who have many conflicts in their travels, become the best of friends. A lot of things happen, a lot of things change. Things come up, things are overcome, and some are never gotten over. In the end, there is a very strong friendship between these three, even if they leave each other.\\nEnjoyment: As you can probably see, I very much enjoyed this show. I didn\\'t expect to love it like I do today, but I do. It was a very wonderful adventure with our lovable trio, and it saddens me that we couldn\\'t continue on it.\\nOverall, Samurai Champloo gets a high 9 for me.

But considering what the series aims to give, it\\'s quite suitable. So instead I\\'ve based the \\'story\\' on the average rating I\\'d give each episodes story line. Samurai Champloo often has a different plot/story for each episode, the story spanning over 2 episodes max. Though this may not be suitable for someone interested in a story intense anime, it allows the creators to fill it with much action, humour, and entertainment. Even with the somewhat cliche stories used, they were done\\nin such a way that I was completely drawn in each time\\n--Art: 10--\\nI absolutely loved the art and animation. The character designs were unique (while still making them fit in with the era). I personally found the art style one of the best I\\'ve seen. As were the designs, it was unique, and expressive, but still very much anime. The animation as well was brilliant, the fight scenes were smoothly animated, and the simpler scenes were done just as well. Easily a 10.\\n--Sound: 9--\\nI\\'m not a big fan of hip hop, so my opinion here may be a little bias, or I\\'d have thought so. Even with a strange music choice, it seems to blend in with the mood of the series perfectly. It just depends if you like it.\\n--Character: 9--\\nAt first glance the characters seem overused, and basic. Fuu, a young cheerful girl who often gets herself kidnapped. Jin, a very traditional and silent samurai. And Mugen, Jin\\'s completer opposite, a self taught fighter who acts before he thinks and seems to have no concern for those around him (unless it\\'s a beautiful woman). And in a way, I suppose that\\'s exactly what they are. But they\\'re perfectly suited for the mood the series wishes, and succeeds to portray. Not only that, but I felt all three characters did have their own little quirks which separate them from the typical characters they seem to mimic.\\n--Enjoyment: 10--\\nI was especially fond of the mixture of moods through Samurai Champloo, some episodes are quite melancholy, tragic even. Usually the longer stories. While others are, to simply put it, strange. The humour in the series meant it could be enjoyed in more than one way.\\n--Overall: 9--\\nAt first glance Samurai Champloo seems full of cliche\\'s, with a pretty basic setup. But this series isn\\'t about intense story or character development, it\\'s about action and entertainment.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"This is a shōnen anime series consisting of twenty-six episodes. Samurai Champloo was created and directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, whose previous television show, Cowboy Bebop, earned him renown in the anime and Japanese television. Champloo comes from the word Chanpuru which means mix or mashup so the title means Samurai Remix. The series in Watanabe's normal preference, is a cross-genre work of media, blending the action and samurai genres with elements of non-slapstick comedy. It is also a period piece, taking place during Japan's Edo period. The series is interwoven with revisionist historical facts and anachronistic elements of mise-en-scene, dialogue and soundtrack. The shows most\\nfrequent anachronism is its use of elements of hip hop culture, particularly rap and the music it has influenced, break dancing, turntablism, hip hop slang, and graffiti. The show also contains anachronistic elements from the punk subculture and modernism, but less prominently.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f57ef270922f8350cacc1884ff1cfe58'}>,\n",

It\\'s severely subjective.\\nCharacter: 10, 3 main characters, the complex between the trio is synonymous of Naruto\\'s Team 7 \"Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura\".\\nJin: Calm, collected, quiet, the pure definition of the textbook samurai. Jin represents order and logic, calmness and composure. A gentleman in the least. He is the mystery man, the James Bond of samurai.\\nMugen: Where Jin is yin, Mugen is yang. Mugen is essentially Jin\\'s dichotomous counter-part. If you have ever studied Freud, Mugen would be the Id. Acting out on instinct, Mugen never fails to entertain.\\nFuu: Surprisingly, there is no love-interest between the three in competition with Fuu. Fuu sets the stage as the mediator between Jin and Mugen, she is the balance between the two extremes; thus she represents the ego.\\nEnjoyment: 9, VERY funny, the comedy is never dry in Samurai Champloo, nor is the action. This is pretty subjective and I can\\'t really relate it to any other anime. What I found very well done was the connection between the samurai era and today\\'s age.

Let's break it down:\\nStory: Rather than being one continuous arc, the series is broken down in small adventures that usually start and end withing the frame of one episode.While some may complain that it's hard to keep track of what has happened in past episodes, I think that for an anime less concerned with feelings and more with fighting, it's an excellent configuration.It also fits well the theme of the anime which, instead of\\nbeing the heroes' self-improvement and conquests is rather a take on subtle aspects and issues of japanese culture and history, such as Bushido, Baseball, corruption, sexism, honor, The West, and Yakuza. AND FIGHTING!!!!!!! The developpers also threw a  recap episode in there.       9/10\\nArt: Stunning. Absolutely marvelous fighting sequences. I had to wait 120 episodes of Naruto to come slightly close the the fluidity and choreography of the fighting sequences in this anime. The drawing style is also unconventional, rending the ugly uglier and the beautiful more so when necessary, making certain moments look like something you could frame. Excellent. 10/10\\nSound: Since the anime is somewhat meta, instead of trying to look serious with hardcore samurai music, it mostly relies on jazz, hip-hop and chill-out music, making it elegant. Also, once, it used beatboxing as backround music. You gotta like that. ;)  9/10\\nCharacter: The characters are well defined and have very clear personalities.\\nThe heroes' backround stories are rather frustratingly vague, but if they had more it would've weighed the anime down and detracted from it's intention. 8/10\\nEnjoyment: I very much enjoyed this anime.

The starting scene was what peaked my interest in this anime and made me realise that this is an anime that I myself would love to watch. I particularly enjoyed the journey across the lands searching for the sunflower samurai as the episodes usually consisted of the main characters overcoming dilemmas and slowly getting closer to each other in non-generic episodes. However, my problem with the story is that I feel like it was treated too lightly and set up poorly, for example the fact that Mugen\\nand Jin both agreed to travel with Fuu (even though it did take quite a bit to fully get them onboard) with ease regardless of the fact that Mugen and Jin were both ''Lone Wolves'.\\nArt:\\nThe animation and art style for this show was quite good, they depicted the fights well and made things interesting for the viewer, you can tell the studio put alot of effort into animating the show. The animation does get better in some points of the anime such as when the warrior priests and Mugen got high on the crops burning, the animation went onto another level by providing great vivid colours and fast-paced action. The character designs themselves aren't that bad, Mugen's design is my favourite what with his crazy hairstyle and tattoos on his legs, these features are what make him distinct from other characters.\\nSound:\\nOverall, the sounds featured in the anime aren't that bad but I will not talk too much about the sounds since it didn't reel me in enough to want to talk about it but that is due to my own subjective self since I am very picky when it comes to liking sounds in animes.\\nCharacter:\\nThis show consists of a diverse cast, featuring many types of people from japan such as artists, homosexuals, ronin, ninja, yakuza, US sailors, prostitutes, etc. This is good in the sense that this show strikes quite well interms of making characters memorable, the different characters and their stories show that the anime is not lazy when it comes to character backgrounds as each character is fit with a sensible story suiting them. This being said, the main characters themselves are not that bad, Mugen with his background is quite interesting although it would have been great to have been shown more, Jin and Fuu's backgrounds suffered the same fate in the sense that more being shown would have been nice although we do get to see their sides of the story and are provided with a good explanation of how and why they got to the point where they are right now.\\nEnjoyment:\\nThis was a rather enjoyable show, it provides us with a good 26 episodes worth of entertainment and I was sorry to see myself getting closer and closer to the end. The characters leave an impact on you at the end, making you ponder what happens when the show ends?\\nOverall:\\nIn conclusion, I give this show an 7/10 solely because I feel like the show could have improved in some areas such as the setting up of the story and the reasons for their journeys. On the other hand, the show itself is mostly positive with great visuals, diverse and memorable characters and impactful scenes. The action scenes are great even though the main characters Mugen and Jin have superhuman strength, this only adds to the enjoyment.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2e411992476c9a096b997a954bb9627f'}>,\n",

I felt that each episode offered something new, introducing a small story each episode that kept you interested from beginning to end. Some of these stories were so well done I found myself revisiting some past episodes. The setting is done nicely and makes it feel like a realistic world. The only problem I have with the story is that I wish there was more focus on the main plot as well as the episodes. Only fractions of the main plot are revealed in the episodes and you feel that the episodic plots are stronger than the main plot.\\nArt: The art style in the anime is very stylish, mixing both classical Japanese art with the graffiti of modern times. The animation is smooth during the action and the backgrounds are beautifully.\\nSound: The soundtrack is just like the art. Classical Japanese music mixed with the old school hip hop. Even with the two being completely unrelated they fit together perfectly. The opening and ending themes are both enjoyable to listen and I found myself listening to the tracks multiple times. The sound effects in the anime was a bit basic but it fit the sword fighting and the environment.\\nCharacter: The three main characters all act completely different.Mugen is wild and crude,Jin, a is calm and well mannered, and Fuu acts cute but also ugly at sometimes. All three of these characters together are likable and interesting to discover who they really are. I did find Fuu more like a damsel since is the one that always gets captured throughout the show. I actually liked the other characters more than the main characters. The supporting characters in each episode are all very funny and the episode villains make good opponents to the main characters. I just felt that the main characters didn't have enough development as the show progressed and they never changed who they are.\\nEnjoyment: Overall this show was enjoyable from beginning to start. The action is awesome, the humor is hysterical, and the drama kept you interested the entire time. What made it so enjoyable was the mixture of the hip hop to the sword fighting giving you an awesome mix of sound and action.\\nI was entertained the entire series.\\nVerdict: All and all if you like action based series with a great soundtrack and are into episodic adventures, you should give Samurai Champloo a try. The only problems I had with it was that the main story wasn't focused on as much and the characters do not really develop throughout the series.\\nStory: 8\\nArt: 9\\nSound: 9\\nCharacter: 9\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nOverall: 9\\n(This was my first review so if you have any suggestions on how to become a better reviewer or any positive feedback, thank you.)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bd7b58725f0c9778c8745b34b4017a3a'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I started Champloo not because of the Cowboy Bebop hype train or anything, I started it because it looked cool, and unique—so I actually headed into this with actually no expectations at all, just a blank sheet. In the end, I left the anime with a smile on my face. One show worth navigating through.\\nThe trick to enjoying Samurai Champloo is to know WHAT it\\'s about. The whole episodic thing should actually be a hint to everyone, that the focus of this story for the most part isn\\'t the Sunflower Samurai Hunt; but just a wild adventure between three complete strangers in a nicely recreated\\nEdo Japan. Champloo generates a fantastic environment the way Assassins Creed does, but also adds various hip hop 21st century references everywhere, making for what I\\'d like to call the \"Champloo Experience\". In the end the only thing that matters initially story wise would be Fuu, Jin and Mugen\\'s adventures and the events that actually draw them closer subconsciously. Champloo tackles heavy topics—slavery, prostitution, persecution of Christians and homosexuals and such with a real air of spunk, adding comedy into the mix but always keeping just enough in to keep the necessary seriousness. The Sunflower Samurai tale finally comes back into focus around the 18th episode or so; and \\'til the final episode, those who decided to stay on are treated to a fantastic fitting unraveling of events, filled with skilfully animated battles and quick, effective development for our three heroes. Champloo maintains its uniqueness from start to finish, creating a rhythm for itself and staying true to it, and despite the end bring rather abrupt when it came, you somehow feel that it is for the best. Simply put, Champloo ends on a funky, good note.\\nIf you\\'re looking for very quick exposition and plot development, this is the wrong place for you. I started SC in December but only finished it this month for exactly that reason—compared to Parasyte and such, Champloo really took too long to showcase its plot, and even I lost patience with it at the 7th episode. But I came back and powered my way through, which in the end was very worth the journey. So yeah, if you can\\'t deal with the long wait for actual plot advancement, don\\'t take Champloo up—you\\'ll hate it. The story receives an 8/10 in my book, because with the exception of one episode, all the others contained good subplots, and the eventual Sunflower Samurai thing was great as well.\\nYou can\\'t mention Samurai Champloo without acknowledging the brilliance of Nujabes (Bless his soul, RIP) and the others. The track is truly funky and groovy, with a sick beat. Nujabes\\' touch is all over Champloo, glossing over the Edo period with this unique hip hop/beatbox soundtrack, which feels awkward at first, but truly ends up being artful throughout. The score, was nailed spot on. There\\'s really nothing else to be said about the music, save that it\\'s revolutionary. Great OP and ED too. The artwork is also very good, with well drawn environments and characters—along with very well animated fight scenes (and there are  loads of these). The fight between Mugen, Jin and Kariya was easily the best rally win the whole show, fully badass stuff. Art and Sound receive an 8/10 and 10/10 respectively.\\nCharacterisation here mainly revolves around our three heroes, Mugen, Fuu and Jin. While Mugen and Jin are the fighters here and genuinely the more mysterious ones compared to the loud mouthed bimbo Fuu, the irony is that Fuu ends up being the most truly mysterious one until the end. We get a vivid portrayal of Mugen and Jin, two polar opposites. Mugen is a rogue, a wild and arrogant man with a short fuse and generally a repulsive one; plagued by a violent past and certain inner insecurities. Jin is a silent, non committal man with a high sense of honour, and a generally more intelligent person; though equally as immature as Mugen when it comes to spats and such—chased by his dark past and wandering in search of his true purpose. Fuu is kind, optimistic, ditsy and often annoying, a vain girl who however is very committed to her goal of hunting the Sunflower Samurai. Though very diverse, the camaraderie which reluctantly develops between the trio is rather touching to observe, as the two men subconsciously put themselves through a variety of hardships for Fuu\\'s sake, and she does the same for them too. The final two episodes show just how close the three have become, as each are willing to sacrifice for the other, bringing into a kind a VERY relevant quote from earlier on the series:\\n\"When you travel with people, they become like your own family.\"\\nMugen, Jin and Fuu become exactly that, after a series of comedic, tragic and uplifting adventures. Family. 9/10 for characters.\\nSamurai Champloo can be draggy at times, but when the fun starts, it\\'s thoroughly enjoyable. Overall, Champloo maintains the fun factor; episodes that lead nowhere in terms of plot tend to build up the main trio even more, and the antics of our three heroes are generally very humour plus and well directed.  8/10 for Enjoyment.\\nOverall, Samurai Champloo is worth watching for those among his that are more sensitive towards culture and artistry; and for those of you who just want to chill and enjoy a long anime ride, this one IS for you.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Shinichiro Watanabe blew me away with Cowboy Bebop, a science fiction tale with a bit of jazz music and western influences thrown in. This time around, it\\'s Samurai Champloo, a samurai tale set in the Edo period of Japan. Of course, it wouldn\\'t be Watanabe without the odd amalgam of genres and tropes. Champloo, also known as Champuru, is an Okinawa word meaning \"blend\", though I think \"remix\" works better. This describes the series perfectly. Samurai and Japanese history is interesting enough, but it really intrigues when a hip-hop soundtrack and urban influence is thrown in to the mix.\\nThe plot isn\\'t anything too fancy or\\nlayered. It focuses on Fuu and her search for the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers\" and her two \"bodyguards\", Mugen and Jin. This is just really a core plot to keep the group moving, the real fun comes with the many wild, crazy adventures they get themselves in while on the trip. The individual stories are so creative and interesting, things never get bored. One episodic could be a comedic romp focusing on the early years of baseball, or another could be a heartbreaking and violent tale of betrayal. Some of the episodes are weaker than others, and sometimes I wished the show was a bit more intelligent...but I digress. The show has it all; comedy, drama, and even more importantly, fun.\\nLike Bebop, the show is episodic in nature, and the only real binding ties are the main characters. Each one is well developed and interesting, with intriguing pasts that are revealed bit by bit over the course of the series (once again, similar to Bebop). Though the characters by themselves are great, it\\'s the fantastic interaction between them all that really shines. They all have completely different ways of thinking, so it\\'s a great formula for character interaction.\\nThe studio behind this project is Manglobe, which I\\'m not very familiar with. That being said, they did an excellent job with the art and animation for this show. The action sequences are some of the most fluid and well-animated in the medium. They\\'re top notch, and this series is around nine years old now. The urban look of the show complements the hip hop soundtrack and badass fight scenes. It\\'s a nice departure from the usual standard samurai look that you see so often.\\nThe soundtrack is extraordinary. Who could have known hip hop would meld so perfectly with samurai? It works perfectly with the urban, stylized art style, and makes the series even more badass than it already is. The opening theme, in particular, is a wonderful piece of music. It\\'s also worth mentioning that beatboxing and rapping also make appearances in the show from time to time, usually in a comedic nature. I\\'m not quite sure if the soundtrack is up to par to Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelt\\'s work on Bebop, but it\\'s pretty damn close.\\nI know I\\'ve mentioned Bebop a lot throughout this review, but it really is unfair to dock this series because \"it\\'s not as good as Bebop\". It\\'s a great series in its own right. With beautiful animation, visceral action sequences, a memorable soundtrack, great dialogue, and interesting characters...Samurai Champloo earns a hearty recommendation.\\nFor reference, my favorite episodes are:\\n5. Baseball Blues\\n4. Gamblers and Gallantry\\n3. Elegy of Entrapment (Verses 1 & 2)\\n2. Misguided Miscreants (Verses 1 & 2)\\n1. Evanescent Encounter (Verses 1, 2, & 3)', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '381badb402bbe9a3074e250afa75c431'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"What's not to like?\\nChamploo means mash-up or re-mix in Japanese, an this is exactly what this show is.  It re-mixes the classic ronin samurai story with modern pop references, and a strong hip-hop vibe, and does it brilliantly.  It's got action, it's got drama, it's got comedy, strong character development, great music, and solid direction.  People I know who claim to abhor anime, still fall in love with this series.\\nIt balances a very thin line of being a serious story with out taking itself too seriously.  But like all the best stories in the world, this one shines because\\nthe characters are well developed, and the story flows through them organically instead of being forced to march forward around them.  In addition to the characters, the stories, being a mash-up if you will, uses the Edo period to comment on modern society, from the sex trade, to art, to literature, to religion, and even atomic warfare.  And it does so without being preachy, or condescending to the viewer.  Instead of just being Important Themes that jump out at you, they work through each episode in a much more subtle fashion, something missing from a lot of anime.\\nI dare you not to like it.  There really is nothing else like it anywhere, (except for maybe cowboy bebop which was made by the same people).

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Cowboy Bepop overhangs any critical appraisal of Samurai Champloo. Notwithstanding the shadow cast over all subsequent anime by Cowboy Bebop in general, the very fact that Samurari Champloo was also directed by Shinichirō Watanabe tends to betoken a parallel a critique of the two. Indeed, this comparison is not exactly void, for there are a number of motifs that conjoin the two shows together, and render their functionality and (where appropriate) overall message as almost indistinguishable.\\nCowboy Bebop fuses the disparate thematic strands of jazz, the space age, country westerns, and martial arts into a disconcertingly plausible universe that challenges our assumptions about the\\nblack-and-white categories we use to fix certain types of experience into carefully demarcated compartments - be they fictional, musical, or artistic. On the whole, however, I would contend that Cowboy Bebop is a decidedly non-didactic show, and succeeds through its masterful directing, scripting, and soundtrack as opposed to its capacity to push a coherent idea or agenda, and either reform or revolutionize the viewer’s conceptions about the world around them.\\nIt seems unfortunate to me, then, that Samurai Champloo lags every-so-slightly behind its predecessor on all three of these accounts - directing, scripting, and musical score. Whilst certainly flourishing in these areas (if not to the virtually inimitable standards set by Cowboy Bebop) it is not alone sustained by them; and yet I would accord it the same rating as Cowboy Bebop. This is because Samurai Champloo manages to, ironically, succeed where Cowboy Bebop merely sufficed - in promoting a narrative, idea, or agenda that proves to be both thought-provoking and paradigm challenging. The fusion of Edo-era Japan, samurai culture, hip-hop, and urban lifestyle is more jarring and chasm-surmounting than the combination of themes, styles, and motifs in Cowboy Bebop. It is not simply showing us that things don’t have to be kept in their correct, pre-labelled spheres of experience, that hip-hop is not just urban and American whilst samurais are not just ancient and Japanese, but so riotously and seditiously laughing in the faces of conservatives and reactionaries everywhere.\\nThis conflict between modernity and tradition is perfectly captured in two of the central characters - Mugen, the rash, foul-mouthed ex-pirate (spoiler alert?), and Gene, the serene, traditionalist practitioner of Bushido - whose attitudes and belief-systems are at such odds with one another that it’s remarkable that they stay together for more than a couple of days, let alone the whole leg of the journey from Edo to Nagasaki. The universe of Samurai Champloo is also, perversely, at conflict with itself; the nationalistic and isolationist policies of the Tokugawa shogunate are continually transgressed upon and parodied by the inclusion of rebelliously modern themes, such as beat-boxing and graffiti. History is presented to us with a reassuring sense of accuracy, and then suddenly distorted as it metamorphoses into an eclectic tapestry of competing and complementary motifs drawn from both the modern and traditional world.\\nThere are innumerable instances of this, and it is difficult to restrain myself from mentioning all of them. Perhaps one of the most simple and salient occurs at the very beginning of the series, when Mugen and Gene first meet and engage in an impromptu sword battle that leaves no clear victor - Gene, well-studied in swordsmanship, remarks that he cannot understand why he is unable to defeat Mugen, because the latter is so undisciplined and technically unskilled. In other words, his very rigid conception of what is and is not good swordsmanship is thrown asunder by the definitively modern ethos of Mugen - who is so uncompromisingly individualistic that, when asked by a security guard (who is stationed at a checkpoint, an omnipresent feature of the Samurai Champloo universe, presumably to mock overly stringent migration controls) to step on a picture of the crucifix (another motif frequently poured into this already heady mix) to ascertain that he is not a Christian, he refuses to do so, preferring detainment or even death over having to submit to anyone else’s authority.\\nAt the very end of the series, a revered and masterful samurai tells Gene that “you were born in the wrong era, and so was I”, in reference to the relative stability and peace of the Edo era that saw samurais as increasingly irreverent. I couldn’t help but thinking that all of the characters in the show were born into the wrong era - from the homosexual Dutchman to the baseball fanatic villager - and that it is both to the benefit of society and the individual to welcome, tolerate, and even encourage a variety of differing cultures in order to reap the fruits of diversity.\\nThen why, if this show is as profound as I’ve (somewhat disingenuously) detailed, does it only deserve an 8? Well, I must come clean, this show is not exactly a George Bernard Shaw play - it is, above all, good fun, a fairly enjoyable 26-episode romp replete with a juicy subtext for pseudo-intellectuals to hinge onto so they can convince themselves that anime is as artistically significant as any form of high culture. And whilst I mainly watch anime because of how irresistibly fun it is, it really needs to blow my socks off to roll into the hall of fame that is ascribed to 9s and 10s. Samurai Champloo occasionally limped into silliness, and rested its laurels on standard, cross-genre anime tropes that have long since ceased to entertain me; there is, at times, a slightly stale stench emanating from the improbable journey of Mugen, Gene, and Fuu, but the series is a classic all the same, and if you want to look more deeply into it, I’m sure you’ll unearth all sorts of wonders to ramble on about.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5cd66276c6108f56ee6e6f585f290774'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"There sure are a few reviews for this series... well I enjoyed Samurai Champloo. Honestly. I really did. What kept it in the air was definitely its characters, they were truly classic. Mugen (meaning infinite) and Jin (virtue) can easily be compared to what people from the Kalymnos Greek island describe as the two forms of manliness.\\nMugen runs along the course of what would be described as a 'stud' or stallion. A man who has no care for the consequences of his actions, eats excessive amounts of meat (as to prove his masculinity), an individual in all rights, and is simply wild and unkempt.\\nJin\\nis the personification of this other manliness, simply put by inhabitants of Kalymnos as a family man. He is conscientious and thoughtful yet strong, a man who would sacrifice for those he values.\\nFuu, I don't know any other way to put it, is the woman (Strange though it sounds as she is only around fifteen). She brings in a much needed feminine quality to the wandering trio, keeps them in line and reminds them of mental things like sentimentality. Simply said, she is the glue. She is the reason they're on the journey, the reason they stick together, and the reason they'll part.\\nI'm not a fan of rap or hip-hop, fortunately Samurai Champloo doesn't force the fact that it has hip-hop elements down your throat. It has just the right balance of subtlety and attitude to be good no matter what your taste in music is, and I have to admit the hip-hop culture references were a big part of the comedy for me.\\nIf the characters kept Samurai Champloo in the air, it was the animation that got it off the ground. The pointedly cartoonish characters were drawn in a refreshing and clear manner with solid lines and not a hint of simplicity, right from the tiny cherry blossoms on Fuu's knife to the insane expressions.\\nThe story (and I don't want to say unfortunately) is functional insofar as it allows the three characters to go on a journey, however it does allow the series to cover a vast array of Japans colorful Edo period. Including references to Van Gough, the dutch, foreign policy, christianity, and the Tokugawa governments ban on all daisho (samurai weapons).\\nTo say this is a masterpiece is an overstatement, but to say it was a great way of using an old modus operandi for a new story is honesty.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '40b6f2c48dd3dbed09ef7a44f96e9709'}>,\n",

All they want is been depicted along the episodes. It is not like if you miss a episode, you will miss a part of story. The story builds up exactly towards the end. But nonetheless, story is unique, creative and practical. I did enjoyed it thoroughly.\\nCharacter: The show is enjoyable with the entertainment from the characters. Be it Fuu, Jin, Mugen or any other characters. The back-stories are well insulated from one another, and revealed over the course of story progression. It seems like all characters are well planned, connected and placed just where they need to be. The character development is just amazing. On one hand you have Mugen, who uses force to solve everything, and on other, Jin, who is calm and wary samurai. And then Fuuu. They are not your ordinary Japanese characters as you might have seen in other anime. If it wasn\\'t for clever,witty,humorous characters, Champloo wouldn\\'t be in this place.\\nArt: It was different. It kinda resembled CB but the different setting and atmosphere made it look different. It was great fun to watch the beautiful scenaries, witty and quirky characters and their emotions. Art style executed well considering the time period of the setting. Integrating modern elements with ninja era worked out well.\\nMusic/Voice Acting: This is next big thing after Characters! Tracks are matching the vibe, adding to humorous characters appeal. If CB and Jazz is the best, Champloo and HH is the King. I can never enjoy the show for it\\'s music as much as SC, and man! those beats and tracks are just made for this.\\nNext big mention is english voice acting. Guys always prefer sub over dub, but this, I don\\'t think sub will ever match the dub. VA understand, reflect the pain and feelings. Cast is perfect. Using modern slang for samurai era sounds stupid, but no. It is the REAL fun of this show. And dialogues need big mention. It was deep, funny, cynical, dark and a mixed bag of emotions. It is well written, well executed by VAs and it is pleasure to listen to the wisdom.\\nAction: I never thought SC can hold action in it\\'s core.

Its episodic nature, simple premise, and one-dimensional characters is a structure that many anime series have implemented. Since its overarching plot doesn't garner a lot of focus and attention, the anime puts emphasis on its character interactions with amusing and chaotic situations. But what makes Samurai Champloo stand out from the rest is that it's not afraid to experiment in its style. Employing a killer score inspired mainly by hip-hop and rap, among other genres of music, and an oddball mix of genre conventions and settings, each arc\\nfeels separate yet highly digestible due to its familiar subject matter and straightfoward characters. It's easy to see how this anime has become a keystone series in anime culture.\\nDespite having said all of this, personally I can't say I loved this series. I was looking for stronger plot resolution in terms of character and some arcs fell completely flat. I actually would have liked to see more eccentricity in its style and commitment when it came to creating unique settings and situations. Still, some scenes gave me absolute chills with its beauty and mastery.\\nIf one were to look at the series just as a product of its time, I believe that people would either view it as a masterpiece or a mess. Time has helped us understand the greatness of Samurai Champloo but a passage in time also means a change in the landscape of anime.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Most anime that becomes popular in the west are somewhat lacking in social commentary on Japanese culture and history. Indeed, Fullmetal Alchemist is more German than Japanese in most respects, Naruto, though certainly uniquely Japanese with its references to historical and mythical ninjas as well as Shinto mythology, was lacking in any social commentary, and shows like Shingeki no Kyojin are remarkably European in setting. Samurai Champloo is an exception to this rule in that it contains heavy references to Japanese history in order to drive home social commentary about modern Japanese culture. Shinichiro Watanabe’s, of Cowboy Bebop fame, second major series is set in\\nlate Edo-era Japan in which social change was being driven by increasing pressure from the west to change, and several moments in Samurai Champloo reflect this and analyze how modern Japan is continually being shaped by this clash of cultures.\\nThe series starts out with a young girl named Fuu working in a tea shop who spills tea on a samurai customer, then a rambunctious samurai (actually, he isn’t really a samurai due to his lower class status) named Mugen who rushes to her defense. Mugen also picks a fight with a quiet, reserved ronin named Jin, and the two proceed to destroy the tea shop and kill the magistrate’s son. They are sentenced to death, but Fuu saves the two on the condition that they help her find “the samurai who smells of sunflowers.”\\nDespite its incredible social commentary and great potential for plot development and characterization, however, Champloo ultimately falls flat in these departments. The plot’s pacing is very unevenly distributed, with virtually no advancement from episodes two to twenty-two then suddenly rushing the overarching plot to climax and conclude in the final episodes. Indeed, Champloo almost fully lacks a plot for the majority of the series and embraces a quasi-episodic format. This, of course, isn’t necessarily a bad thing; after all, episodic anime are often among the best such as Mushishi. If Watanbe had stuck with an episodic series or had opted for a more western plot-driven anime, Champloo could’ve been much more successful; however, ultimately the series can’t make up its mind as to whether it is plot-driven or episodic, and that detracts from its artistic quality significantly.\\nThe characters are also heavily lacking in this series, for similar reasons to the plot. The only three major reoccurring characters throughout the entire series are Mugen, Fuu, and Jin, none of whom are very well-written or compelling. Fuu often comes off as helpless, whiny, and selfish, and her motivations are not explained at all until the very end of the series. Jin is almost completely flat and lacking in personality, though he does have a far better developed backstory than Fuu; unfortunately, this is revealed in somewhat of a contrived manner only through dialogue and flashbacks in the middle of a battle, which gives him the feel of a bad shounen character. Mugen is the best developed of the three major characters, with his backstory revealed slowly throughout the series in a believable manner and the most likable personality of the three. He also is the only one who’s somewhat dynamic, starting out completely selfish and moving towards a bit more empathy by the end. However, his and Jin’s motivations for going on the journey are not very well explained and it’s somewhat not believable that they would embark on such a journey and stay with it for so long in the first place. Despite the problems with the plot, some of the episodes are simply incredible in terms of plot and social commentary, particularly the one about the gay Dutchman, and the one revolving around St. Xavier’s followers.\\nWhat Champloo lacks in the traditional elements of (western) storytelling, it more than makes up for in its execution, in directing style, animation, and soundtrack. Watanbe has truly cemented himself as a master of cinematography with the innovative camera shots, transition sequences, and battle scenes. It is remarkably difficult to find a well-directed sword fight in any film or television series, however Watanbe was extremely impressive in his directing of the fight scenes, particularly near the end. Further, the pillow shots that transition between scenes are often as gorgeous as they are innovative. The overall mood and aesthetic of this series is absolutely the main reason for its draw. The plot could be way worse than it is to the point of being abject garbage, and I'd still say it was above average for its animation and tone.\\nThe animation to Champloo is also significantly above average. The background sets are a gorgeous style that manage to be both impressionistic and realistic at the same time. Unfortunately, some of the character designs are over-detailed and poorly animated, particularly most of the middle-aged male side-characters throughout the series. However, its inconsistent quality in character designs is more than made up for in its background sets and the fluidity of motion in the battle sequences.\\nThe soundtrack is one of the most notable features of this anime. It mostly consists of anachronistic hip-hop beats by Japanese rapper Nujabes that contrast with the historical setting of the anime. The anachronism, however, works and connects modern Japanese culture’s interactions with the west with the clash of cultures experienced late in the Edo era. Though the hip-hop references within the show can sometimes become a little overbearing (characters beatboxing and an episode about tagging were not necessary), but the soundtrack is overall among the best all-time in anime. The introduction song, “Battlecry,” is particularly noteworthy for its great rapping akin to Rakim Allah or Nas and addictively good hip-hop beat.\\nOverall, Samurai Champloo is definitely a good anime. It certainly lacks in terms of plot and character development, but the incredible artistic decisions make it well worth watching. This is a prime example of a subpar plot executed to perfection. Further, though this isn’t primarily a comedy, it can occasionally be hilarious and is thoroughly enjoyable. But the best element of this anime, by far, is its commentary on modern Japanese culture, particularly with respect to religion and sexuality.\\nOverview:\\nPlot: 5/10\\nCharacters: 4/10\\nArt: 10/10\\nSoundtrack: 9/10\\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\nOverall: 7/10\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3498b0354f48944b86b9f7216a7f6e1b'}>,\n",

I would recommend it to anyone reading this review.\\nStory- The story of Samurai Champloo is about a group of 3 people in Feudal Japan trying to find a “Samurai that smells of sunflowers”. I know this doesn’t sound like a great idea for story, at least that’s what I thought when I read the description on Netflix, but it is a great story. The story is episodic but it still pushes the plot forward in each episode. It gets more and more exciting as the 3 get closer and closer to finding the Samurai. Episodes\\ncan range from very funny light hearted episodes that will have you laughing the whole time, to badass fight episodes, to emotionally gripping and tear-jerking episodes that really make you feel for the characters. Another great thing about Samurai Champloo was that not a single episode was repetitive. The only downside to the story is that it is a bit simplistic. I rate the story 9/10\\nArt- The art of Samurai Champloo is very high quality and well done. It fits the whole style of the rap and Feudal Japan themes. The animation doesn’t have a single flaw to mention, the fights were animated very, very well and they looked amazing. Although it fits the themes well and it is high quality, I personally dislike this type of art because all of the characters look kind of like water paint blobs with really dark outlines around them. I give the art 9/10\\nSound- The thing that makes Samurai Champloo unique is the sound of it. It seamlessly blends a weird but good rap music theme with a Feudal Japan theme (Champloo means blend hence the name, Samurai Champloo). I know that sounds weird but trust me it’s actually very good. It is one of the most unique styles in anime. The opening displays this mix very well and kind of shows you what you’re going to be getting into when you watch the show. Not only that, but the opening sounds good and gets you hyped for the cool action sequences and the fun of the adventure. The soundtrack, while not a masterpiece, still fits well with the show and its theme and adds to the immersion. Also, the ending song is superb. Definitely one of the greatest endings of all time. 10/10\\nCharacters- This is where Samurai Champloo truly shines. The characters are on par with Baccano, Hunter x Hunter, and even Neon Genesis Evangelion. I loved all three of the main characters because they were all so unique, well developed, and generally cool people. There is Mugen: a samurai that is a badass and always gets in fights and says cool stuff; Jin: Another samurai who is more calm cool and collected, but still badass when he needs to be. Fuu: The girl who got them to help her find “the samurai that smells of sunflowers” and is funny. All the characters are absolutely hilarious. I give the characters 10/10\\nEnjoyment/Overall: I enjoyed Samurai Champloo very much. I laughed my ass off countless times while watching this series. Every episode was a new, exciting, adventurous, and comedic installment in the series. I give Samurai Champloo a 9/10. Don’t’ get me wrong, I love this series to death and it is probably one of the few anime series that I could see myself rewatching in the future, but a series has to truly be in a whole other league to be a 10.

After watching Bebop, I jumped on it. Hard.\\nThe premise is simple, it's a largely episodic series about three youngsters travelling together in samurai era Japan to find one of those samurai. Only one of them, Fuu, wants to find him, while the other two, Jin and Mugen, are indebted to her but really just want to fight to see who's the tougher bastard. Like Bebop, they're usually scrounging for their next meal, and they always find a way\\nto get into trouble - running into a hidden Christian community with a crooked preacher, being hunted down by another swordsman, getting caught up in a gang war and illegal gambling ring, the list goes on. Each episode is quite unique, so you don't have to worry about things getting boring. The time period is interesting and really beautiful to see explored, with a few modern twists thrown in for a great style.\\nWithout a doubt, the first thing to point out about this show is the animation value. It's superb. The fight scenes are a treat to watch, as well as all of the character design and background art. Visually, this show is a feast.\\nWhat really keeps the show together is it's soundtrack, which is almost to the same incredibly high standard as Cowboy Bebop's was, this time using experimental hip hop. I wasn't a hip hop fan going into this, I thought it was a dull genre of music that just wasn't for me, but I don't even leave the house without Nujabes on my phone now. Just name an emotion and there's a track on here that'll make you feel it, and feel it hard.\\nThe story itself is good, however it's the characters that keep it fresh and interesting. Jin is reserved and moral, Mugen is outlandish and a thug, while Fuu is the naive one who keeps the group together. Initially, they can barely stand each other, but as the story progresses, you really get to see them bond and develop, becoming large parts of one another's lives. But don't think they're humble enough to admit it. I'll admit, there are two pretty lame filler episodes right before the final arc, but they're so eclipsed by the ending that they're quite easy to overlook and forget about. What really wraps this up in a neat little bow is the talent of the english dub, each character sounds exactly like you'd expect them to.\\nGreat animation, great sound, great vocals, wonderful and memorable characters, if this isn't ticking off any boxes on your list there's something wrong with you. If you haven't seen Samurai Champloo, you've missed out on probably the strongest show from 2004. This isn't another Bebop, but it really tries to make itself rather than riding on coat tails.

Much like its art, Champloo\\'s soundscape is primarily used to highlight the atmosphere but occasionally doubles as an effective comedic tool. The pervasiveness of tracks like Aruarian Dance and Counting Stars--even outside of Champloo itself--are a testament to its soundtrack\\'s greatness.\\nCharacter\\nGiven the vastly different personalities of our three protagonists, most people resonate with at least one of them in addition to a handful of the sizeable cast of characters they meet along their journey. There\\'s Mugen, your textbook delinquent, Jin, a reserved and courteous ronin, and Fuu, a bubbly, kind girl seeking help from two ice-and-fire swordsmen. As for the various interesting people introduced, again, they don\\'t all quite feel unique but the majority of them are so deep and rich--you can\\'t help but wonder about their past and their future beyond what we little we are shown in the story. The character development within the trio doesn\\'t always shine as the story progresses, but the lessons and exchanges carried throughout the story manifest themselves in subtle ways, often without mention. It takes a bit to recognize the developments, but they\\'re definitely there and certainly interesting.\\nEnjoyment/Overall\\nThere were standout moments in Champloo that I\\'m sure will stick with me for a long time to come. The action, the comedy, and most of all, the kindred souls of the series leaves one longing for one more adventure--it\\'s over, but \"I wish that this could go on forever.\" All ends tied up, and yet Champloo still leaves viewers with that inexplicable feeling it always does.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'cda5bf02c614a28f0877c564f1d56df4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"5/10.  (THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)  If you're interested in a non-fanboy review, enjoy the read, my apologies, it's rather long and thorough.\\nTLDR: The story is extremely lacking, and Characters have 0 development. The whole anime can be summed up in about 6 episodes, instead of 26.  It's pretty much 20 episodes of filler.  Good, filler, but pointless. Beautiful, fun and exciting, but with nothing to tie it all together.\\nI had tried to watch this anime years ago, and watched as far as episode 4.  It was okay, but I had this nagging feeling, even back then, that it was\\ngoing to be a disappointment.  Several years later, after hearing some of my friends rave about how good it was, (yet again) I decided to give it another go, and this time I dedicated myself to watching the entire series...and I confirmed that my suspicions were correct.  It wasn't as good as everyone kept saying it was.  There are a few factors on which I like to rate anime which are in no particular order:\\n1: Depth of Character\\n2: Art Style\\n2.5: Combat\\n3: Music (Including absence and timing of)\\n4: World Depth (locations, magic, religion, society etc.)\\n5: Quality and Depth of Story\\nSo, lets start with the First.  Depth of Character.\\nDespite what everyone says, depth of character in this anime is fairly lacking.  The characters do have strong characteristics, in which they each have good screen time, and they play off each other very well, however, it becomes painfully predictable.  I continually hoped that there would be character development, but was poorly disappointed.  Mugen remains a spontaneous immature man, Jin remains stoic, and Fuu loves food.  And that is it...for the entire 26 episodes.  Are they fun Characters?  Absolutely.  But that's not enough.  There were many little fun plot drops, like the assassin who decides she is going to marry Mugen.  The 'who does Fuu like?' question that is never really fulfilled. Jin's temporary romance with a prostitute. Mugen learns to read, but nothing comes of it.  Tons of potential for character development, but then episode ends and the next one has nothing to do with the last.  It was extremely disappointing. At the very end (which I was also disappointed with) they finally realize that they are friends and like each other... so As far as Character Depth?  2/10\\n2: Art Style.  The art style in Samurai Champloo is fairly amazing.  I would suggest this is the strongest supporter for the anime.  From the detailed environments, to the beautiful sunsets, to clothing and facial expressions.  The art is surely not lacking.  Now, if you prefer a more modern style, perhaps like Hellsing Ultimate or One Punch Man, than you may be a little let down.  The style is definitely a little older, however, I felt that this was a strength rather than a weakness. I really enjoyed the bizarre mix of edo era Japan with break dancing, hip-hop and graffiti.  It oddly gave a strong charm to the anime which was reinforced with the artistic style.  8/10\\n2.5: Combat.  Everyone I've talked to about Samurai Champloo mentions how good the combat is.  The martial arts, and the choreography. I however, was not impressed.  The combat primarily consists of one man charging the other with his sword held up, and the protagonists simply takes one dodge, one cut, and one kill. Rinse and repeat.  Now, admittedly, when you are dealing with a huge skill imbalance as presented in this anime, yes, things often would go like that.  But it's certainly not very entertaining to watch, especially when the main characters would then arbitrarily be overpowered and captured. It was a little inconsistent with their 'might'.  Now, there were a few scenes in the anime which you could describe as 'boss fights', which were quite entertaining to watch.  There was some great art, and choreography involved with some of these scenes. The first introduction fight between Mugen and Jin being one, and then fighting Kariya, the second.  Very good representation of duels.  Other than that however, I was left wanting. The more I watched, the more I realized that it was a lot of camera spinning around the combatants as the 'swayed' dodging each-other's attacks, with white lines drawn to symbolize their misses, which looked okay, but it wasn't actually all that good.  All that said, this is definitely a huge step over older anime in which a lot of combat was just a panning still images, but still, it's not as good as everyone makes it out to be.  I would give combat 7/10.\\n3: Music.  The music was really good.  Even if your not into hip-hop, like me, you can still really appreciate the general aesthetic that it provides the anime.  It tremendously lends itself to fulfilling the quirky and fun world that the creators were going for.  There were also several great piano pieces, as well as some classic Japanese style songs.  All that said, in some anime, the music really takes the cake.  Thinking perhaps of Death Note, and the power that the music is able to portray is almost unparalleled.  So in comparison to the use that music can have in an anime, it is perhaps a bit lacking in Samurai Champloo. However, it certainly adds more to the anime, than subtracts.  I would give it 7/10.\\n4: World Depth:  I really enjoyed the world.  From the landscapes, to the weather, sunsets and flowers and trees.  All of it was well placed and artfully done. The locations did feel different.  There were different levels of 'business' at each of the locations.  A small travel lodge was adequately inhabited by wanderers or hunters, where as a the larger cities had much more busy streets with many shops.  The world felt well populated and laid out, including the maps that they showed in the anime showing their journey. The religions were a bit interesting.  There was some sort of 'underground Christianity' that was going on, which turns out to be more of a cult but it's significance is not ever really fleshed out.  Additionally to that, my favorite episode was the one where they stumble across a 500 year old mining camp that is inhabited by zombies.  It was eerier, unnerving, fascinating and unique. There were also some political drives in the background, but unfortunately, these were never fully explained either.  The World seemed to have more than was presented, but was also lacking in it's detail, which left me wanting.  They gave a fair amount of world info 'just in passing' which is fine, but I would have appreciated more.  6/10.\\n5: Quality and Depth of Story:  And finally, the part which was completely lacking in the anime.  Seriously, this part fails completely.  The story is, 2 guys journey with 1 girl to 'find the Samurai that smells of sunflowers'.  This is given in the first 2 episodes. Aside from one flashback and maybe two assassination attempts, Nothing Else Happens till episode 24.  There are almost 20 episodes of nothing.  Literally Nothing happening!  In the One flashback it is obvious that the man she is seeking is her father. And the two assassination attempts reveal a little more about Jin's background.  And that is literally it.  It was extremely disappointing. There is one episode where an assassin decides she is going to marry Mugen.  But then she is never heard from again.  What happened to that plot line?  There is another episode where Jin 'falls in love' with a prostitute, but then that episode ends and nothing happens.  There is even an episode, get this, where a meteor falls on top of them, and then the next episode their just walking on their way again.  Nothing matters.  Absolutely nothing that happens has any importance, relevance, or lasting meaning in the anime. Nothing!  It is one of the most disappointing anime that I have ever seen.  The only development happens in the last episode, where Jin and Mugen realize that they are friends and they don't want to kill each other, and then they go their separate ways.  Which is a huge let down. And that is it.  Done. Bye!  I mean, really?  That's the best your authors could do? You could really just watch about 6 episodes in total and have the whole story summed up and done.  And that to me is a huge failing in any anime.  I'm definitely biased in this, but I'm giving it a 1/10.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b3fe8cc3fbcd6dbead3b89368b7fe38d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"This anime is absolutely outstanding. I first started watching this anime when i was on a plain flight in the USA. At first i started this anime because i figured out that it had music from the outstanding Nujabes. but then I also figured out that the anime also was directed by the same person who made Cowboy Bebop, another amazing show that is kind of similar in style. infant I'm going to be comparing these two anime because they are both very similar and popular.\\nOn with the review\\nStory 9/10-could be be better but otherwise magnificent.\\nThe story unlike cowboy bebop actually has more\\nan overarching plot and goal. when i watched cowboy bebop I originally had it on hold because i just thought that it didn't have enough plot, I soon completed it after this anime. While the show is still very episodic I think it could be comparable to shows like Avatar the Last Airbender. Which isn't an anime, but is still very popular. the main characters are still taking a long journey to there goal, but as they go on the episodic journey, little bits and pieces start to form, until you have your ending and climax.\\nThe show also takes place during the edo period, but more modern, which is a very interesting setting.\\nCharacters 9/10 - very colorful cast of characters, Fuu could have ben better.\\nThe characters are extremely interesting and colorful. the main characters Fuu, Jin, and Mugen represent the present, past, and the future. Because of that there personalities and attitudes are different. Jin's personality is very samurai like, while also having a smart and refined ora representing the period before the edo period in Japan. Mugen's fighting style is more whiled and he is much less refined kind of like the modern day youth.\\nand Fuu doesn't have a fighting style, probably because the time period that she lives in is a peaceful time period without war. Her personality is laid back, but she does want to get her job done.\\nWhile Samurai Champloo might not have as many characters as cowboy bebop, I do feel like this is to there benefit, because having a nice defined smaller cast of characters makes each character have more time to be developed. Its easier to develop 3 characters then 5.\\nArt  9/10 - old age is a thing would have liked the images at 1080p\\nThe art in samurai champloo is very detailed and outstanding. even for an old show the aesthetic and the style still amaze me. the style also fitts well with the rap/jazz style really well.\\nSound 10 - the best thing about the show.\\nThe music in this anime hit it out of the park. Much like Cowboy Bebop this anime is music themed which i appreciate. Love that artsy stuff. Anyway Nujibes, Fat Jon, and a couple other artists worked on this show witch is pretty cool. I cant really describe music so just watch it. its good I'm telling you.\\nEnjoyment 10 - never a dull moment.\\nThis is one of my favorite anime ever. I always loved every aspect of it. Though there were some flaws none of them were that notable.\\n9/10- amazing show that you should watch,\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f2159f05d29e222d443461b58719aea9'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Phew, where do I even begin with this masterpiece... I encourage you to read this review in its entirety because I will break down why EXACTLY this show deserves an overall 10.\\nSamurai Champloo is a show that will come as a new flavor or facet to the infinite world of anime and the norms embedded within it. If you\\'re new to the world of anime, this show\\'s implications and place in the anime universe may not be as well-received but that doesn\\'t mean that certainly doesn\\'t mean that you won\\'t appreciate the poetic and artistic justice that this show does to anime, in general.\\n------------------------------CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\n(9)-----------------------------\\nAs of the first episode, almost as swift as a slap in the face, you are introduced to the interesting and perplexing characters of Mugen, Jin, and Fuu. Mugen is a brash, immature, vulgar, laid-back, avant-garde man who originates from an island where criminals are dropped off and left to live by themselves. This causes him to develop his initial character personality when you meet him. This violent environment caused him to teach himself swordsmanship. Jin is calm, collected, and possesses a quiet, stoic demeanor which stems from his rigorous training as a swordsman in his former kenjutsu dojo. The polar opposite to these two personalities is the cheerful, upbeat, kind, caring Fuu, a young teenage girl who lives with her uncle and aunt working for their teashop due to her father missing and her mother deceased.\\nThese three characters are seemingly complete opposites of each other which would normally prompt conflicting ideas, arguments, and fights. These do happen, no doubt about it, but their journey together as Fuu\\'s unofficial bodyguards in her search for the samurai who smells like sunflowers brings them together in a way that can only be accomplished through the brilliant and creative mind of Shinichiro Watanabe, writer of the series and Cowboy Bebop.\\nThese three often get so caught up in their arguments that they often split up and leave, going their path and swearing to never join back again but this only leads in them coincidentally seeing each other again and fighting a common enemy and continuing on their journey together, regardless of each individual\\'s reluctance.\\nThroughout the series, we see how each person\\'s actions and situations cause the other two to grow and develop their character into something they couldn\\'t even imagine themselves being at the beginning of the series. Watanabe develops each character\\'s personalities and changes them in a way that reflects the camaraderie and the journey they took together as a piece of each person\\'s heart that will never be replaced.\\n----------------------------------ART/SOUND (9.5)-----------------------------------\\nOne of the main factors that deviate this anime from a lot that you will watch is its artistic presence. Samurai Champloo\\'s scruffy, old-style animation gives viewers a retro vibe from the whole anime. This is extremely similar to the feeling that people get when watching GIFs on YoutTube of \"slowed-reverb\" songs. The heavy uses of colors like crimson, cherry-blossom pink, and caramel/hazel tones of the sun are significant in expressing the historic colors of feudal-Japan, known as the \"Land of the Rising Sun.\" The presence of the sunrise and sunset in each episode shows the significance of new beginnings and the end of journeys that are inevitable for anything in life and the colors that enhance this are heavily present throughout the show.\\nNujabes was the main producer of the OST for Samurai Champloo. He, unfortunately, passed away in a tragic car crash but his iconic application of anime/hip-hop beats will live on as markers of breaking traditional norms in anime, such as Samurai Champloo did. Mugen\\'s sword-fighting style relies on using his environment and performs a lot of breakdancing tactics that don\\'t follow traditional kenjutsu or other sword-fighting styles that are widely taught. Nujabes uses this throughout the series by implementing hip-hop beats in the fight scenes. Not just in fight scenes but throughout the entire show, the iconic hip-hop styles used in conjunction with authentic Japanese-style music gives an entirely new facet to how sound can bring a new perspective on an anime. Watanabe most likely used this tactic before during Cowboy Bebop with jazz. To put it simply, IT JUST FITS.\\n------------------------------STORY AND ENJOYMENT (10)-----------------------------\\n\"Champloo\" or also called \"Champuru\" is an Okinawa term that is best described as \"mixed-up\" or \"mashed-together.\" While most people might perceive this only for the amazing mix of retro-Japanese-style animation with modern hip-hop beats, it goes further than that and can be applied to the story and characters. The \"mix-up\" can also refer to the three polar-opposite personalities of our three protagonists and how their destinies are seemingly intertwined and journey together. Throughout their journey to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, they find themselves in many different scenarios and problems each episode, ending in them only barely making it out with their lives. The personal motives and personalities of each character change throughout the show as they each understand a grander scheme of life: the journey.\\nThe reason I enjoyed this anime so much was the ending, which I obviously won\\'t spoil. However, my review wouldn\\'t be nearly complete if I didn\\'t address the overarching message and theme of this show that makes the ending so amazing. Every journey has a start and an end, just like life. Life starts with your birth and the actions you\\'ll make, places you\\'ll go, people that you\\'ll meet, and the emotions you\\'ll feel are all part of your journey. But where, or more importantly what, does the journey lead to?\\nWatanabe\\'s intention with the whole premise of Samurai Champloo and its ending is that whatever story you watch entails a journey that is bound to end. But the destination, no matter if it\\'s good or bad, is hardly the central focus of this show, contrary to many popular anime. The journey is what matters most. The stories we witness, how each character learns more about each other and life, the emotions that the audience feels; we should take all of this into account and reminisce on it because it\\'s the journey that really matters. This is the message that was the last arrow that struck me in the feels and made me absolutely love this show.\\n\"Don\\'t cry because it\\'s over... smile because it happened\"\\n- Dr. Seuss', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1234ac45d3d907c0f167698a41144e85'}>,\n",

But when from the moment I watched the first episode of Samurai Champloo, I knew that it was different, a very good kind of different. From the funky hip hop thematics to the fluid, thick, black line animation, Samurai Champloo became more to me than an anime with a good soundtrack.\\nStory: 8.9/10\\nHere we have three strangers in the Edo time period setting off on a journey to find a \"samurai that smells of sunflowers.\" Samurai Champloo focuses on these three... But at the same time\\nit doesn\\'t. Most of the episodes are of the trio getting themselves into trouble and trying to get out of it, but it\\'s these situations that subtlety ties the whole storyline together. Through every problem that Fuu, Mugen, and Jin get themselves into, the more they rely more on one another until the final episode when they realize how much they care about each other. The small morals about courage, loyalty, and friendship are really pleasant as well, even though the anime insists that it\\'s nothing about that. Although it didn\\'t give me that life changing impact by the end of the show, Samurai Champloo will still stick out to me for it\\'s unique presentation of story.\\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\nThe thing I like about our main characters is how different they are from one another yet they fit each other so well, like Yin and Yang. The total opposition in personalities that they all have balances out and creates a trio that makes Samurai Champloo filled with excitement, humor, and drama. Additionally, each one has a hidden past that creates more interest. Mugen, rash and straightforward, relies on instinct rather than intellect. Jin, conserved and traditional, uses his bright mind and level headed-ness to get him through situations. Fuu, ditzy and demanding, keeps the two in check all the time. These three start out as distant strangers in the beginning, but we can notice an unbreakable bond form between them as the story carries on, which makes Samurai Champloo even more precious.\\nSound: 9.5/10\\nThe sounds of Samurai Champloo stuck out to me very much. What we have here is a mix of funky hip hop beats with traditional Japanese Edo era music. It exemplifies the counter-culture feel even more throughout the series. The opening and ending are both unique and amazing songs. Nujabes, shing02, fat jon, and Minmi used their talent to create an OST for Samurai Champloo to remember.\\nAnimation: 9/10\\nSamurai Champloo\\'s animation was another huge factor that made the anime unique from all others that I\\'ve watched. The thick-lines of the people and the beautifully fluid animation from the fight scenes made Samurai Champloo incredibly fun and easy to watch. Considering how it was made in the early 2000\\'s, the animation is definitely impressive. However, there are some scenes that seemed like the animators slacked off and didn\\'t put as much effort. Nonetheless, I adore the fluidness of Samurai Champloo.\\nOverall: 9/10\\nSamurai Champloo has ranked itself among the list of anime never forgotten in my mind. I truly believe that it\\'s considered a milestone in anime history, considering its unique presentation, music, animation, and subtle yet sweet story line.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Samurai Champloo is living proof that a comedy absolutely can have a cast of likable characters and a solid storyline to boot. On top of all that, this show is a contender for having one of the greatest soundtracks in an anime, ever.\\nStory: 8    **some minor, episodic spoilers within this section**\\nWhat is so fascinating about this show is how that, underneath all the comedic antics and funny situations the group finds themselves in, the show paints a more grim depiction of life during the Edo Period. Though largely revealed by the fact that many of the episodes involve the trio struggling to\\nfind food and/or shelter on a day-to-day basis, this theme is much more loudly, and sometimes more seriously, portrayed by the people they cross paths with during their journey. A teenage boy turns to petty thievery to pay for medicine for his mother's worsening ailments. An aspiring artist, struggling to make ends meet, is coerced into painting girls' portraits as a catalog for a human trafficking ring. A woman turns to working at a brothel to pay her husband's gambling debts. Life in the Edo Period is grueling, is what this show is saying. And despite this, Samurai Champloo always leaves you laughing through each episode. The greatest triumph of the show's storytelling is how well it balances comedy and drama. It knows it's a comedy, and provides you with many memorable scenes to laugh at, but has expertly placed moments of sincerity that never feel forced or out of place.\\nBeyond this, the show features an overarching storyline, their journey to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers. What begins as a simple tale of three estranged characters romping through Japan, slowly and deliberately evolves into a more character-driven story that forces the trio each to face the ailments of the past, as well as struggles both internally and externally. While not a blockbuster hit, it maintains a solid story with good characterization and a satisfying ending to each character's personal issues and the story overall.\\nArt: 8\\nSamurai Champloo has a very unique style, as it features a period-specific setting with a touch of contemporary nuances. The art style of the characters breath a very distinct breath of individuality in a comedy show featuring samurais and hip hop music. Everything is stylistically and aesthetically pleasing for the most part.\\nSound: 10\\nOooooh boy. The music. I distinctly remember the first time I watched this on Adult Swim back in 2005. I was always taught to never judge a book by its cover, but the intro immediately had piqued my interest. Who knew that hip hop instrumentals would fit so perfectly with a Japanese period piece? Featuring tracks from talented artists like Force of Nature, Fat Jon, Tsutchie, and of course, the LEGENDARY Nujabes (if you've never heard of him, I IMPLORE you to listen to Departure, the first soundtrack album for Samurai Champloo), the show's stylistic directions are amplified tremendously, giving Samurai Champloo a great distinction not just as a comedy or a period piece, but as an anime as a whole. The soundtrack is well placed throughout the series, knowing when to allow the dialogue to carry the scene, and when to add flavor and style to the events taking place. Even with people who generally don't like rap or hip hop, I have yet to hear of someone who disliked the show's soundtrack.\\nCharacters: 8\\nThe show is filled with personality. Not just the three main characters, but nearly everyone they come across in their bizarre journey. People who fulfill their comedic roles very well. People who reveal the grim underbelly of the series' themes. People who serve to expose and challenge the main characters' inner demons. There are barrels of likable fellows in this show, for many different reason. Though I speak very highly of the characters, I give this particular area an 8, mainly because there are a few characters that come off a little flat, and not just for comedic purposes. Overall, Mugen, Jin, and Fuu are well written and internalized throughout the series, which is something unusual to say about a comedy, though I'm certainly not complaining.\\nEnjoyment: 9\\nThis show managed to force out of me a handful of belly laughs, while at the same time persuading me to become invested in its characters and caring about their journey's outcome. There is not a single dull episode in this series. I understand it may seem weird to speak so highly of it and not award it a 10, I certainly can't blame you if you think that. It may just be a natural hesitance to award a perfect score, though I can't bring myself call Samurai Champloo a PERFECTLY enjoyable experience. Despite this, I still want to reiterate simply how fun it is to watch this show.\\nWhen it comes to anime that I find myself rewatching every now and then, for any given reason, this show is on the top of that list. Samurai Champloo is an excellently crafted anime that deserves to be watched by anyone who loves a good comedic anime. And please, for your own sake, watch it with English dubs.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6aca2734bdf247a5c0b0f970ca9db470'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Brought to use from Shinichiro Watanabe, who most people will remember for Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is a fantastic looking fusion of Feudal Japan with a contemporary feel, but what lies underneath the surface?\\nThe plot begins when Fuu Kasumi, a waitress in feudal japan, is living a fairly normal life...riiight before the brash and arrogant vagabond Mugen decides to crash there for some tea, bringing in quite a few mooks and then our other male lead, the straight faced and cool Jin, to end up entirely wrecking the place and nearly getting them both executed. With some words and some coin flips, Fuu hires Mugen\\nand Jin as her bodyguards while she journeys the land to find a mysterious sunflower scented samurai.\\nStory-wise, the show is primarily episodic, but tries to have a building plot throughout it involving the sunflower scented samurai and Jin\\'s past. To be honest, though, this mostly ended up amounting to nothing in the end, as the stuff teased in the ending is largely obvious before it even happens and does not amount to all THAT much, mostly on the Jin/Mugen side. This might not be such an issue, except the series tends to tease it out quite a lot over the course of its show, which makes it feel like it is trying to build up to more: This makes the episodic nature feel a bit less fun and the self-contained plots trying to lead into this end up working less. It was particularly tiresome to see the end of the show use this to poor effect, as dramatic leadups to the finale get interrupted halfway through for silly and bizarre episodic plots, which severely hurts the overall narrative and really helped tarnish the story for me. It gets buoyed up by many of the episodic plots being quite solid, at least. One issue is that all of this makes the show very slow feeling, which also hurt it for me.\\nCharacter-wise, the main trio of Jin, Mugen and Fuu are all pretty well done, although I feel Fuu could have gotten a bit more focus/depth to her. Jin and Mugen\\'s sharp contrasts nonetheless mixed with many similiarites is a very effective use of the having characters be Foils, although I feel both Jin and Mugen suffer slightly from the plot\\'s developement. The one shot characters are hit and miss, with some great ones like Sara and the gay Hollander, some good-but-not-amazing ones like Mukuro and some really memetic ones like Francisco. The hits weren\\'t large enough to help compensate for the pacing issues and lack of overall strong narrative.\\nOne of the issues I overall had with the show is that the investment I had in the characters was somewhat limited by how the show did not explore them a ton, feeling a bit more like a \"monster of the week\" style show. Probably one of the bigger examples of this is Jin, as there was a lot of potential to explore the ramifications of his past, but it ultimately mostly gets some token stuff in the story before the admittedly quite cool fight at the end. Fuu also did not get as many focus episodes as I would want and remains a bit too static throughout the series.\\nOne thing this show undeniably has is top notch presentation. The artwork, even about 12 years later as of this writing, is superb and rivals or surpasses a lot of anime that has come past it, with interesting and well drawn character designs for both the beautiful and ugly alike, very well choreographed (although sadly usually short) fights, great facial expressions and even the ability to adapt the style to do things like show traditional Japanese artistic styling. This is combined with a really superb score: Pretty sure that everyone knows about the hip-hop beats and stylings, but less known is that this show actually incorporates a lot of traditional Japanese folk into the mix, and then when you get to some of the combat tracks which can range from graceful to rock, this show spans an impressive amount of genres and manages to do them all quite well, with the OP \"Battlecry\" being especially memorable with the striking visuals, and an impressively graceful ED.\\nStill, while the impressive visuals are really nice, the story ends up lackluster, and helps limit the investment of me into these characters by hurting how much I can connect to them because of the shallow exploration of their characters. If you want an episodic, sometimes wacky, sometimes action-y show, then Samurai Champloo will meet your desires, but if your interest lies in the set up they provide in the story and how it evolves in the story, you will find yourself disappointed.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"I think I was much too young when I first watched Samurai Champloo on Adult Swim. Now that I have had a chance to grab the new DVD thinpak, I was able to rewatch and properly asses this show. Most importantly, I really would like to see this Manglobe studio get out there more. Ergo Proxy, Champloo, Bebop and all their other series have a very unique journey feel about them. They make some of the best stuff out there artistically too, so more series in the future would be a godsend.\\nStory; 9. It's episodical. And it's on and off, although only three or\\nfour episodes got on my nerves. The individual stories were all very cool, and enhanced by the insane and creative cast. The artistry here, you will find, is so off the hook. This series is really in a leauge of it's own even among the other Manglobe works, because the artistic flare here is much, much more over the top. In a very good way. The stories all had next feels about them, from gangland to drama, and even a very stylistic zombie episode. As expected, the philosophical value is present but also welcome in it's subtle presentation. It took a sure backseat to the fun, which I was very okay with.\\nArt; 10. This is the second best part of Samurai Champloo. This is the most unique, artistic anime I've ever seen. It's great, the urban theme is prevelant in large part to the lanky, streamlined drawings that moved so strangley between fluently and erraticly; it's the coolest thing you'll ever see. Colorful, creative goons abound; this series boasts a carnival of cool characters, from a Brooklyn accented baseball ninja to a double agent geisha; and i'll never forget the marijuana farming battle monks. The main cast is great too, but they wouldn't have been as great without such great side roles. Jin is my personal favorite.\\nSound; 10. Anime music sucks, and there's no argument against this. It's bad; Samurai Champloo's soundtrack is something I listen to all the time. I would love this soundtrack without the show. It's a work between Nujabes, FORCE OF NATURE, and Fat Joe, as well as cameos by many rappers and MC's like Shing02; suffice to say, if you are a hip-hop and turntablism head like I am you will love this soundtrack so much. The mixing is great, the OP and ED are both awesome. Every track is a crazy soundscape, and art aside the soundtrack mixes classic japanese folk with hip hop seamlessly in a way it's a sin not to hear. Phenomenal, easily the best anime soundtrack ever.\\nCharacter; 9. Jin is a silent, reserved badass. Mugen is off the walls, with a unique combat style rooted in fairly creative breakdancing, and Fuu is the classic helpless teenage samurai girl. They are all also a satirical representation of samurai action cliches, and they are presented in this way flawlessly. I'll save details, but these three are really great characters individually and together.\\nEnjoyment/Overall; 9. This show is artistically unchained, musically perfect, and paced quite well. The characters are inventive beyond compare, and that journey feeling is really exclusive to this studio. I felt it more in Ergo Proxy, but this (especially with it's killer final scene) had a really really soothing, down to earth reality about it that you should experience just as much. Champloo is a great show, especially when your old enough to care.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Hello there. Trying to find out more about Samurai Champloo to see if you want to watch it? Well, let me start by making this clear: you MUST watch this anime!\\nThere are enough sources about the general storyline, so instead I will just say that it is well-written, coherent, well-paced, and absorbing! Our three heroes, Fuu, Jin, and Mugen, go on a great journey, and will take YOU along. They travel through Japan, encounter many kinds of people, and get to do many interesting and funny things besides fighting. The numerous intentional anachronisms you can find bring a great touch of humour. You get to\\nlearn a lot about Japan too.\\nThe character development is amazing. The main characters have distinct personalities, styles, and pasts. They form an unlikely trio considering how different they are. Fuu, Jin, and Mugen grow throughout the episodes in a very pleasant way. You will get attached to them. The other characters they encounter are for the most part very eclectic and add to the fun.\\nThe music is some of the best anime music out there. There are a huge number of songs that bring the anime to life, give it rhythm, and are very recognisable. In fact the OSTs are well worth owning (downloading them is fairly easy too).\\nThe art is nothing mind-blowing, but it is good and perfectly suitable for this anime. The battles are particularly interesting. The only bad detail that bothered me in some poor CGI that was used for about only 10 seconds total.\\nHow did I enjoy this series?

The story doesn't feel far-fetched yet it is, it's full of surprises and you really don't know what to expect or what adventure they'll embark on next.\\nThe character development is phenomenal.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show.  \"I don\\'t like the art style\" or \"I\\'ve seen the dub - NO THANKS.\"  I\\'m guilty of both of these myself.  But if there\\'s one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it\\'s that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece.  For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is.  If you\\'ve suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh.  They\\nbutchered it, there\\'s really no other way to put it.  They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series.  FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I\\'ve seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.\\nAs for the art style, it\\'s true, it\\'s completely different from almost anything else I\\'ve seen.  Much more \"cartoonish\" and maybe not what you\\'d expect from an anime.  Despite that, you end up loving it.  I wouldn\\'t even say that you have to \"get used to it\" because it\\'s not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way.  It didn\\'t even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I\\'d experienced before.  Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can\\'t remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have.  Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.\\nNow that we\\'ve got those two points out of the way...\\nOne Piece is actually one of the best shows I\\'ve ever seen, anime or otherwise.  The plot is pretty basic at first.  Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure \\'one piece\\' and become Pirate King, and he\\'s looking for a crew to sail with him.  You\\'ll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them.  They\\'re all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities.  They form one very quirky crew that\\'s always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams.  Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they\\'re just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew.  Not one character is left out or feels like they\\'re there for no reason.  Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these \\'purposes\\' often resurface at later points in the series.  No detail is left untouched, and you\\'ll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.\\nThe plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE.  Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it\\'s definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you\\'re swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you\\'ll ever watch.  The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC.  But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it\\'s lighthearted, humorous edge.  The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few.  There\\'s always a wonderful balance of action and humor.\\nOne Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise!   There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things.  I\\'ve definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point.  One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments.  And underneath everything, there\\'s always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.\\nIn a word, One Piece is perfect.  And perhaps I\\'m just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say?  It\\'s been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end.  It is, simply put, amazing.\\nSo why should you watch One Piece?\\nBecause you\\'re missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don\\'t at least give it a try.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c6454489b4f6f6bda219fe6c3081d687'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched.\\nBut not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we?\\nA long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age.\\nIn the world of One Piece, there is such\\na thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water.\\nAnd where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates.\\nNow how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple.\\nOne Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be.\\nOne Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together.\\nMost shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable.\\nIn contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does.\\nAnother potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is.\\nDo not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit.\\nIn short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen.\\nRegardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that.

Now for a younger audience it may not matter that much, but to me as a higher age audience, it matters greatly, after all, out of the 23~ minutes of each episode 3 are spent\\non opening and ending (which is usual I guess), but in most episodes, roughly 5 (!) or more minutes are spent on a recap of the current story arc, as if the creators of the show forgot it\\'s a shounen anime and instead got the idea that the audience are elderly people with Alzheimer.\\nBut ok, this means there is still 15 minutes left per episode right? Well, not really. In most episodes, the heroes get separated. When they do, the anime tries to keep track of ALL of them simultaneously, cutting every few minutes. This wouldn\\'t be so bad IF after the cut, the same exact scene did not repeat itself (example - a few seconds that show one of the main heroes standing and looking at a place/ villain that is shown from a few angles. Then the anime continues elsewhere, and when it comes back to the same place, the same exact scene is shown). That may not sound as much, but in drastic cases that can sum up to a few minutes (the worst case I bothered to count was almost 4 minutes of time wasted on watching the same scene). Combined with a lot of other tricks, I\\'d say that a lot of episodes are left with about 11 minutes of actual content on average. That is simply dreadful.\\nNow to say some positive things for contrast- the story is actually very interesting and the characters are well done... BUT, no matter how good something is, if you drag it out too much (and this is indeed the case with One Piece), even the best story in the world and the best characters possible (not to say one piece has neither of those.. The story is great, and the characters are good, but not more) will not keep you entertained, and turn even the best story possible into a boring experience.\\nNow back to the negatives. NO ONE DIES IN THIS ANIME. This is of course an exaggeration, as some people actually do die in this anime BUT only when it\\'s critical to the plot. At all the other times, the characters \"die\" just to add drama and to come back a few scenes later.. Sometimes to \"die\" again and add even more \"drama\" (added \"\" because at this point its more awkward/silly after one time rather than dramatic). The worst case of this I saw was with Brownbeard who \"died\" something like 5 times over 2-3 episodes (if I remember right), and still stayed alive in the end while the show tried to suck as much drama out of this as possible. And this brings me to the next point- fake drama. They seem to try and squeeze out as much of it as possible, at every opportunity they get. From crying children (and adults) to characters repeatedly \"dying\" and to the most cliche tearjerkers possible at every turn of the story. They even go as far as to try and make the villain\\'s henchmen AND EVEN THE VILLAIN himself have a tragic past that you are supposed to relate to and feel sorry for (because seems a villain can\\'t just be evil because that is just the way he is, he had to become evil because something bad happened (lol, how about sheer ignorance or plain greed for wealth or power?)... and we apparently MUST know. for both villains and side characters that we\\'ll never even see again). Also I mentioned crying.. There is an unbelievable amount of it in this anime. And that would be ok (I guess) if\\nA- they did not try to milk it for drama (yep, that\\'s a word that sure gets a lot of use when discussing this anime huh?) every single time\\nB- they didn\\'t think that when someone cries, he instantly turns ugly, with snot running down his nose and with the worst face expression possible, regardless of gender,  age or how emotional he is.\\nI\\'d say a lot more, but there is already a lot of text, and it\\'s enough to sum it up - this anime is not one I would recommend someone to watch under any normal circumstances (maybe only if someone made a shortened version with all the repeats, openings, endings and cuts removed thus making the whole anime be at around 300 episodes max), I watched over 600 episodes myself, and I can safely say that although some parts were enjoyable, it was mostly rather boring when looked as a whole, and especially the later episodes, and I am regretting the time I spent watching it (as to why i watched it so far- my friend recommended it to me and I did not expect it to last this long. I usually finish what I start, but this is ridiculous, bad, and really beyond me at this point.)', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f8148b5b34e1d4669404c30b4e55e60e'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '*Contains major spoilers*\\nWell I\\'m about to do what most people consider suicide... Talk bad about One Piece...\\nFollowing: Full-fledged review and chibi review-version at the end for those who can\\'t read:\\nFULL REVIEW:\\nTo be clear about this: I have seen all movies and all the episodes released until now (ep 658) and while there are tons of things I\\'d like to talk about, one thing stands above all: One Piece never grew up like other shounen did. Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball and even Fairy Tail have become more mature and improved themselves over the passage of time. One Piece is still the same non-serious, immature nonsense that first\\naired in 1999.\\nWell to begin with One Piece\\'s famous strongest point, the story... I am just not impressed. Ignoring the fact that after 600 episodes the anime\\'s new arc revolves around talking toys and chibi fairies (childish as hell), most of One Piece\\'s arcs are practically the same. Straw Hats arrive at said island, where a tragedy has been happening despite the place appearing bright on the outside, the whole tragedy originates from 1 man who is usually evil for the most pitiful of reasons, straw hats get seperated into 3-4 groups, straw hats kick villain ass, a big feast is thrown in by the glad citizens where another arc is foreshadowed before they move on to the next island. And while people will argue that the \"War of the Best\"arc was different, I still didn\\'t find it the least bit interesting (2 deaths only? really?).\\nStaying on the story part, lets talk about what\\'s arguably the most important story element in a shounen: The villain. One Piece has yet to show us a villain whose appearance isn\\'t laughable. Crocodile was wearing a coat in the middle of the dessert, Enel\\'s ears were too long not to notice, blackbeard is missing way too many teeth to be taken seriously, Donflamingo... I can\\'t even begin to name the things that make him not-even-slightly threatening. In general One Piece follows the brilliant rule that \"evil is stupid\" and the protagonist\\'s charge-ahead thoughtless moves always prevail against the plans the villains had been setting for a few good decades now. Going for villains\\' backstories, it\\'s usually brilliant writing such as: Stupid for the Yolo, big misunderstanding in the past, pity jealousy and \"we will explain it some time in the future\". Sorry, its just hard to take these guys seriously.\\nStill on the story part: Being so kid-friendly is annoying. I can\\'t get over how War of the Best, the \"grand battle\" of One Piece only had 2 victims, or how the Colosseum in the Dressrosa arc had no casualties whatsoever in a \"battle to the death\". Oda grow some balls and KILL people. Also regarding Ace\\'s death in the War of the Best... I am not amused by how all of One Piece fans claim it as the most tragic thing to ever happen and yet we knew nothing about Ace other than the flashbacks. You could just as easily have put a Nazi Officer in his place and I\\'m sure the fanbase would still be crying buckets if we saw a flashback of said officer playing with the snow as a child while some uninspired dramatic music was playing. I can\\'t decide if I\\'m more annoyed by the awful writing or how moronic the fanbase is.\\nHumor & Fanservice: Waaaaaay too repetitive. It was funny in the first 100 episodes, now I just want to chocke puppies every time Brook makes a skeleton joke or Luffy and Chopper get overly excited about something. On the fanservice + story part: There is no female lead. Nami and Robin became important characters for their respective arcs (Arlong + CP9) but right after that they slipped in the background and became minor characters. Still on the Fanservice part: Oh yeah, sex, flirting and even love don\\'t exist in this universe. Everyone trying to take part in one of those is either a villain-in-disguise or someone about to be tricked because of their stupidity. In general: For One Piece Sex/flirt/love is stupid (right next to \"evil is stupid\").\\nSound Part: 1st: The variety is a total disappointment. I can\\'t remember a single track that actually got me on the edge of my sit. 2nd: The animators don\\'t even make proper use of the soundtracks that already are avaliable to them. For example remember the final fight Luffy had against Crocodile. Do you remember the epic music? Obviously no because some moron decided that the fight shouldn\\'t have music at all. Now imagine if at the same scene (final moments before Crocodile\\'s defeat) One Piece\\'s original opening \"we are\" was added. Suddenly the scene becomes 100% more exciting. They already had the copyrights, it\\'s not like adding it would hurt anyone! The sound effects are equally terrible. Just look at the brilliant sound effect of Sanji repeatedly kicking Don Flamingo in ep 655... Sorry but I have made RPG Maker games with better sound effects than this. On the voice acting part: MOTHER OF ALL ATTROCITIES, IT\\'S HORRIBLE. Just look at the age of the voice actors, half of them are about to die (and I\\'m crossing my fingers). The voices are completely unfitting for most of the cast, not sounding at all like the age they\\'re supposed to portray (well that\\'s a big surprise...). Of course screams of despair, crying etc etc don\\'t sound even relatively convincing.\\nAnimation: Just awful. Way below the antagonism. The only worse animation example I can provide in a relatively similar episode release period was the \"fast-paced-action\" in the Naruto Vs Pain battle, and that was an artistic mistake on the studio\\'s part that was never again repeated for exactly that reason. I won\\'t even go into detail describing how lazy the studio is, using the same footage OVER AND OVER AND OVER.\\nAction: Doesn\\'t really exist. One Piece doesn\\'t ever show a proper fight without something goofy (aka annoying morons making even more annoying jokes) breaking up the seriousness. When the anime does decide to get serious it\\'s just Luffy screaming on top of his lungs cliche lines while the villain doesn\\'t even bother debating and just tries to kill Luffy (not that I blame them). The fights mostly consist of 10 seconds of action being repeatedly shown with slightly different soundtracks playing on the background each time and villain lengthy monologues inbetween them, usually followed by concentration-breaking flashbacks of things we have already seen a million times. If you\\'re hoping for creative fast-paced excitement look elsewhere.\\nOne Piece is like a kid that never grew up. After 600 episodes, despite all the \"hardshps\" our protagonist came through, he never really matured, none of the characters did. The tone of the anime didn\\'t mature either. a graphics improvement and a gradual increase of the cast members being the only notable changes since the beginning of the anime and for me it has just become too monotonous, too boring. Once Piece is waaay past its due, but there is a single reason it stays alive. Nostalgia. People are willing to overlook all of its flows simply because it serves as a bridge for times when things were simpler for them (or so they remember at least). But if someone was to judge One Piece for what it really is and not for the happy memories of being taken by daddy to the Luna Park he would see it for what it is: Trash.\\nCHIBI REVIEW VERSION:\\nAweful animation and soundtrack, followed a story that quite clearly follows a pattern even for its jokes, overly repetitive and with action that doesn\\'t really remind of action. Immature, with annoying characters that are portrayed as \"smart\" rather than \"morons\" and laughable villains.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Review In short,\\nI'm Going to keep it real with you all that you would obviously see my score that i gave One Piece.\\nWell, That is why in my review I'm going to go over these factors as to why this isn't worth your time so that I can save you a life line. So for that You are welcome. (This Applies To Manga Also in case your wandering)\\nAnyway I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching and Investing my time with this and its pretty simple why that is and why It made sense\\nfor me to review One Piece.\\nFirstly Its very easy to base this series on the analogy of this being a shonen adventure series yes, however what continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now and to put it simply if I were to sum up this series in a nutshell It would be summed up in 4 words...(Typical Forced Annoying Tendencies)\\nTo empathize my point much further,\\nThis anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where the story is heading now because its writer\\nOda Eiichiro unfortunately likes to Time waste WAY too often in his\\nwriting of milking hundreds of episodes of this series of its so called world building and brain wash a lot of its Japanese audience as well as those that following the whole over saturated popular shonen trend in the process to the point that the fans themselves have overate this anime in general in its own category.\\nLiterally the story has not changed to any degree where a new plot can be implemented differently in its approach which sadly isn't the case let alone can the story mature with its premise as this is still following the same freaking formula of a repetitive lame shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most of its episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now so far which I really question if this anime just wants the viewers attention just because of its length that can still be milked because of it?\\nOR does it want to be a pirate adventure shonen that can integrate an effort into its story and characterizations? Well at this point I can easily tell you that both completely Suck at making these traits realized in Oda's craft which is not engaging my viewing of the same formula with many random added coincidences that luffy and strawhats encounter on their journey and with that has lost more credibility in claiming that this is an anime about pirates in general which is even more ridiculous throughout and for the longest time after a while I just found this series to be rather boring and predictable in its long tedious dragged out boring narrative.\\n(Btw, Nothing to do with just its length or its terrible look in general)\\nI honestly got to ask those currently watching or even reading One piece\\nDo you really like to enjoy the same old tropes and jokes over and over again that includes many long pointless plot elements that have many cons for milking their story and character for its own purpose??\\nIts Just like how the Naruto franchise lost credibility thinking its own series depicts ninjas in its own way to show the struggle taking place for nonjas old and young in its own viewing in the show which shows in both naruto and one piece over time what it has lost through its extended transition in both their writing of these concepts.\\nAs a shonen anime Its these glaring flaws that just keeps continuing on and on. That in terms of its story, characterization, progression, writing, enjoyment and any replay value what so ever for a shonen experience which becomes blatantly obvious that it fails! especially when some claim this to be the definitive shonen anime experience of a grand adventure. (Oh Dear.)\\nThere are 2 clear things fans will use to defend this show by saying don't be put off by the shows length or its dumb cartoony animation and secondly dont be put off with the handling of the material in the way Toei Animation handles this so instead read the manga, And to that I say.. NONSENSE! Since the show already has a lot problems already that fans seem to gloss over.\\nYou see, Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through for what has loads of the same problems as I've mentioned above.\\nIf that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up feeling pretty much the same Forced Melodramatic story in its writing that you have seen and heard loads of times and only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even SLOWER pace for this show in each of its build up with each Arc that by over hundreds and hundreds of episodes later by then it totally becomes unacceptable, By then I don't blame certain people out there for skipping chunks of its story now and then.\\n(Trust me, Having tolerance for this anime should be the least of your worries here people.)\\nFor me going through each arc to arc in a easy going manner that I approach most anime through my viewing You'd expect that this would be casual thing of ease for me right? No sweat? WRONG,\\nIt didn't guarantee me as a viewer any love or charm what so ever to a lot of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series.\\nInstead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most if not all of these characters and YES that does includes the main crew along with their progression except for some few in the straw hat crew that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it?\\n(Some bonding that is if you ask me?, since only a few certain characters with plot armour that can do certain things most others couldn't do)\\nEven when uniting the straw hats together only just makes it for a more cheesier affair most of the time when you would obviously expect it Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does.\\nWhich also regards to parts where one piece at some parts wants to go dark its already so desperate to up the ante that a blind Ray Charles can easily tell from miles away that its only going to result into a similar conclusion like before.\\nI mean come on! its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms.\\nOne Piece fans try to Over hype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case.\\nA terrible excuse for making points along this series own progression just because its stretched out as it has been for the premise inexcusably which is a joke for those who try to justify this notion.\\nLook, We already got the basic gist of things going on in this series from the beginning, Even through its dumb world building and set up and even till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect.\\nI believe the one piece fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose.\\n1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far,\\nIf you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better.\\n2. Pointless prologues to your episodes.\\n3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing.\\n4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of one piece until HUNDREDS AND I MEAN HUNDREDS of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this.\\n5. Dumb fanservice depictions of its females making video games like dead or alive and Onechanbara look a lot more tolerable.\\n6. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned hundreds and hundreds of episodes ago as its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consistency for constantly dragging on in the way it does.\\n7. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway.\\n8. Its lame music score that should sound great but it doesn't.\\n9. Most of the times bad animation no doubt, AKA Toei Animation VERY LAZY INDEED and are swimming in pools of Yen around them like fat sewer Rats.\\n10. Devil fruits abilities in the way with any other devil fruits that are demonstrated looks stupid and nonsensical to the overall balance and power scaling with variations of different class devil fruit users, which in term of supposedly creating unpredictability and uniqueness to a devil fruit user's abilities only serves to unfortunately create a convoluted mess of an explanation of devil fruit powers in general to those that are Logia, Paramecia and Zoan in their own element even in terms of their weakness which is badly depicted on in the show.\\n11. Haki creates a lot of bullcrap deus ex machinas later on as an excuse of not explaining a lot about devil fruits all that well and lots of times is used mainly for plot armour for certain characters of the writer's choice which is lazy nor does it add anything new to the battle scaling in fights more like unneeded add ons.\\n12. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how Oda writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends.\\nWith all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about one piece are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way)\\nbut those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more.\\nOverall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT PIRATES WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT PIRATES ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS.\\nThat is like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOOOOO............. that won't be right, so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes? because you know It sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... WELL WRONG AGAIN.\\nNow going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general.\\nLast but not least The fights really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pacing and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in today. Consider this dropped and good riddance.\\nExcuse me for being honestly critical as I am as I do not sugar coat a series if that is what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving out tens towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome.\\nTo all of you who have read my review thanks for taking the time and take care.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '894d0a48dd66486e92ce7c487442e6ab'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review\\'s goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series.\\nAnd by the way, this review is based upon the original Japanese version. If you have had the bad luck of viewing the 4Kids\\ndubbed version, you have my heartfelt condolences. Right, well, anyway, moving on...\\nPLOT: The story of One Piece mostly consists of the Straw Hat Pirates traveling from island to island and having crazy adventures. Although each crewmember has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: to reach the end of the treacherous Grand Line. Bound by this promise, they pass through unbelievable adventures. Given this pattern, you would think the plot would get boring and predictable, right? Amazingly enough, unlike shonen anime with similar plot devices, One Piece manages to become less and less predictable as its plot advances. As it advances, it also delves into serious situations. There is actually much tragedy involved with One Piece, but the show maintains a balance of comic relief as well. I\\'ve actually been driven to tears many times while watching this show, but I\\'ve laughed out loud just as many times, if not more.\\nART: One Piece\\'s art style is one of the elements that turns many people off to the series. The style is fairly old-school, remniscent of 90\\'s shows like Dragonball Z. Then again, I guess One Piece started out in the late 90\\'s, too, so that\\'s to be expected. Either way, the quality of the animation steadily improves as the show moves along. The show is now broadcast in HD, and the quality simply blows me away with every new episode. But the show\\'s animation style remains the same, just greatly improved in terms of quality. After all, with a show as crazy as One Piece, modern animation styles just wouldn\\'t fit. I simply cannot imagine Monkey D. Luffy with eyes like Uzumaki Naruto; it simply does not work.\\nSOUND: I absolutely adore the music of One Piece. There are so many different kinds of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, angry, confused, funny, sleepy, scared, epic, cryptic, foreboding, intense, etcetera, etcetera. For each of these situations, there is a unique musical piece which plays in the background. What\\'s more is that each character has their own style of music and their own theme. Whenever I hear a background song, I immediately know what\\'s going on, and fall into the according state of mind. It happens subconsciously, and it adds to both the predictability and spontaneity of the show. If Zoro\\'s \\'epic\\' music begins to play, he may still lose his current battle. However, whenever I hear that music, I immediately know, \"Zoro is going to dominate in this scene,\" regardless of whether or not he actually does.\\nCHARACTERS: I cannot think of enough synonyms for \"incredible\" to sufficiently describe One Piece\\'s character development, so I\\'ll just say that it\\'s definitely SUPER!!! Ahahaha...yeah, that was a reference to the show...anyway, the characters of One Piece are one of its major selling points. In fact, it was the characters, not the story, that hooked me to this show. Each character has their own personal reason for sailing the Grand Line and for joining the Straw Hat Pirates, and this goal pushes them to new heights with each passing adventure. This goal is backed by an emotionally engrossing backstory which usually can encompass more than two episodes. I have been moved to tears by so many touching flashbacks I no longer possess enough fingers to count them all. The characters are all very personable as well, and are the one aspect of One Piece you can nearly always predict. You always know Luffy will be Luffy, and Usopp will be Usopp. Never would you expect Sanji to suddenly lash out at Nami, but you would certainly expect Nami to lash out at everyone else. Do not misunderstand me; I am not implying that the characters of One Piece are static. They are all decidedly not static. By comparing the current Luffy with the Luffy of the first few episodes, you can discern an obvious difference. The same holds true for all of the crewmembers. Yet the changes take place gradually over time, not all at once. That is my favorite part of this anime. Just like actual humans, the One Piece characters develop new traits and discard old traits, but always remain the same person they were when first introduced.\\nENJOYMENT: When trying to convince my friends that they should watch One Piece (mostly so I can discuss the latest episodes with them), I inevitably have to ask myself why I personally enjoy the series. And then I am stumped. I mean, I could say all the above and people still wouldn\\'t be satisfied. There would be people asking, \"Well, why do you like that kind of plot? I saw this one show that had a different kind and I liked it.\" How am I supposed to respond to that!? That\\'s the equivalent of saying, \"Why do you like chocolate ice cream? I like vanilla, and it\\'s way better.\" Whether you enjoy something or not all depends on how your brain is wired and your attitude when you try it. Just because I love One Piece doesn\\'t mean you will, and just because someone hates One Piece doesn\\'t mean I have to. Erm...I kind of got on a rant. Ehehehe...uh, yeah. So, I enjoy One Piece because of the above reasons. Is...that all I\\'m supposed to put here? It seems inadequate for some reason...\\nOVERALL: In conclusion, I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don\\'t, please don\\'t discount it for any reason until you\\'ve actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn\\'t really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable. Oh, and as a matter of precaution, DO NOT WATCH THE 4KIDS DUB! If you do, then you may very well suffer severe damage to your cerebral cortex. If you must watch the show in English, I recommend the FUNimation dub. Their DVDs contain about 13 episodes each, and are available wherever you buy your anime.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn\\'t honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it\\'s welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I\\'m dead serious, I really don\\'t like One Piece and I will explain why.\\nOne Piece reminds me of a line from one of my\\nfavorite movies: Shaun of the Dead. Shaun: \"I like having him around, I\\'ve known him since primary school, and besides he\\'s a laugh! Pete: \"Ok, I admit on rare occasion he can be funny. Remember when he was up all night drunk playing Tekken 2?\" Shaun: \"Oh yeah (laughs) when was that?\" Pete: \"That was 10 years ago! When the FUCK is he going home!?\"\\nWhile other shonen series at least try to mature along with their fanbase like Naruto going to Naruto Shipuuden or Dragonball going to DBZ, One Piece is the same goofy, juvenile crap that it was in 1999, right down to the eye raping HORRIBLE art. Another problem is that it tells a continuous story, which makes it difficult for new fans to get into it or get caught up without spending 5 straight months doing nothing but watching One Piece! Pokemon has an excuse for running forever and never evolving (get it?) because new games come out and each season Ash must move to a new region and catch more Pokemon. Most people don\\'t continue to watch Pokemon, so it is constantly getting new fans that are experiencing Pokemon for the first time. Pokemon (insert edition here) is their first Pokemon game and the anime seems fresh and new to them. They haven\\'t seen the original Pokemon series or played the original games and it doesn\\'t matter! Detective Conan has been running for 20 years, but like the Sherlock Holmes short stories it took inspiration from, it is completely episodic with a new mystery each week and only a few established characters. A new audience can jump in anytime and it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'ve seen the first 15 seasons. One Piece actually tries to tell a continuous story where it DOES matter what happened in the first 10 seasons. You can\\'t just jump in at episode 600 and expect to really enjoy it and understand it. However, even you get all caught up with the 800 episodes of the Straw Hat Crew, it isn\\'t worth it because the tone, characters, and quality of story telling never matures into anything that someone 16 and up and having half a brain would find amusing!\\nAll of this isn\\'t to say that One Piece is a particularly bad anime. I have seen some REALLY bad anime, but One Piece isn\\'t on my list of anime I actually hate. One Piece is an anime that I consider mediocre, insanely overrated, and having run WAY past its time without having the grace or decency to take a bow. It is much like the Simpsons in that last regard. At least one good thing came out of One Piece....None Piece! If you haven\\'t seen One Piece yet, I would recommend skipping this one, but still check out None Piece on Youtube, because it\\'s awesome!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4a3cbb37e6d3370307c085caf2606c74'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own.\\nLuffy ate a Devil's Fruit as a child, more accurately the 'Gomu Gomu' fruit (gomu means 'rubber'), thus his body took on the form of rubber, enabling him to stretch and inflate himself at will - though the downside for anybody who eats a Devil's Fruit is that they can no longer swim: something of a disadvantage for a pirate. Luffy\\nis a bit of of a unique character in all of the anime series I have watched: he's not smart, but he's not stupid. Perhaps 'simple' is the best way of describing him, as he has the same thoughts and ideals no matter what the situation is, sees no reason in pretending to be something he isn't, and often has trouble adjusting his fun-loving character to act appropriately in serious circumstances. Although he is the captain of the Mugiwara Pirates, he is pretty much held in line by the rest of his crew, especially Nami. He does, however, usually get the final word.\\nLuffy's aim is to become Pirate King and to claim the ultimate treasure that the old and greatest Pirate King, Gol D Roger, announced at his execution was at the end of the Grand Line: the most dangerous, treacherous and feared ocean in the world. This treasure, 'One Piece', gives the series its name. It is yet unknown exactly what One Piece is, or what it does. However, with every island of the Grand Line that the crew traverse (the only way to sail the Grand Line being to hop from one island to the next) they are one stop closer to finding Gol D Roger's heritage.\\nThe rest of the Mugiwara Crew consists of characters just as well-rounded, though still retaining their individuality. Roronoa Zoro, a green-haired 3-sword-wielding (one in each hand, one in his mouth) bounty hunter who has come to be known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro' (though the name was neither coined nor furthered by the man himself) joins the crew in order to realise his childhood dream of becoming the best swordsman in the world, figuring the Grand Line should bring him a plethora of worthy opponents.\\nNami, the navigator, is a beautiful yet intelligent orange-haired girl whose dream is to draw a map of the whole world - though her main passion is accumulating vast sums of money, usually via theft. She is generally the brains of the crew, but occasionally needs Luffy to show her that her heart is in the right place.\\nUsopp, a long-nosed man whose penchant for stretching the truth is made evident in pretty much every episode, wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great pirate. Although he's not as strong as other members of the crew and has no specific 'special powers', his quick-thinking and ingenious-yet-comedic inventions have too often been known to save the day.\\nSanji, self-professed 'Love Cook', is a talented chef from the floating restaurant Baratie, who can cook as well as he can kick - Sanji is generally characterised by his inability to resist stepping in to rescue a beautiful lady, especially Nami (even though she manipulates him simply because she knows she can). Sanji joined the crew after great persuasion in order to find All Blue, the legendary ocean where the four seas meet, and thus fish from all the seas can be found - a gourmet cook's paradise.\\nTony Tony Chopper is the ship's doctor. Here's where it starts getting a little, well, let's say idiosyncratic. Chopper is a reindeer (not a tanuki, a reindeer!) who ate the 'Hito Hito' Devil's Fruit (hito means 'man'), meaning that he is not only able to talk (to both humans and animals - a skill that comes in very useful), but also walk on his hind legs, and even transform himself from cute to somewhat monstrous forms. Chopper wants to become a great doctor and help people, and eventually, after much persuasion from Luffy, sees piracy as a way to give his wish meaning and direction. An ongoing joke with Chopper is for him to shout &quot;Doctor! We need a doctor!&quot; whenever anybody gets injured, before realising that he's the ship's doctor, and so gets to work. Chopper is a cutesy/comedy character but also gives us plenty of reasons to take him seriously.\\nFinally we have Nico Robin, a woman with a mysterious past, and another with the power of a Devil's Fruit. Robin ate the 'Hana Hana' fruit (hana = 'flower'), and thus is able to grow hands from any surface - an ability which sounds pointless on paper but has saved the Mugiwaras from so much danger over the episodes that it has become almost integral to their survival. Robin is an archaeologist who joined the Mugiwaras at her own behest, as Luffy had saved her life against her will. She spends most of her time reading history books, and someday dreams of finding the 'one true history' of their world by traversing the Grand Line in search of 'lodestones', which have ancient documents inscribed on them.\\nEven at the early stage of introducing Luffy and watching him recruit the first few crewmates, I had fallen in love with this anime series. The first 20 or so episodes are somewhat slow-paced, as well as a little confusing, as the quirky sense of humour that One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda gives the series takes a little getting used to for a gaijin. The other members of the crew don't want to join Luffy's outfit immediately, but Luffy manages to convince them that becoming a pirate with him is the best way to realise their dreams, and also helps them to tie up loose ends in their homeland before setting off under the straw hat-wearing Jolly Roger.\\nIt's important to bear in mind that these are not your classic Western, rum-toting, eye patch-wearing, &quot;YAAAAAARRRRR&quot;-shouting pirates, with huge beards, peg legs and hooks for hands. That isn't to say there aren't characters who fall under these categories (except for the &quot;YAAAAARRRR&quot;ing), but One Piece is a world filled with intensely interesting, larger-than-life characters who bring a dimension to the anime you wouldn't have thought possible. The powers of the various enemies of the Mugiwara crew bring an almost rock-paper-scissors element to the show, as the party is often split up into groups who have to survive and meet back up with the others in order to continue their journey, some characters' expertises being more useful against certain enemies than others - although the rubberman never knows when to accept defeat!\\nThis anime contains some of the most imaginative and out-of-this-world story arcs I've ever come across in an anime series, especially one that does not take itself too seriously. One arc sees the Mugiwaras sail up into the sky to 'Skypeia', or Sky Island, where they take on an evil God who has the power of lightning. The final 'showdown' battles can span 10 or more episodes and are, for want of a better word, epic. Simply the journey undertaken to get onto the Grand Line itself is a tale worth rewatching for its many highlights, as well as being an introduction that comforts you by subtly indicating that the future escapades of the Mugiwara crew will pique your interests further.\\nThe Mugiwaras are to a point misunderstood as pirates - they don't plunder, rape or murder everybody they meet. In most cases, they actually help those they come across, but are still very much wanted by the Marines (the main governing body of the sea), who set huge bounties for Luffy and Zoro in order to garner help from bounty hunters, as well as the many other pirate factions sailing around.\\nThe animation sometimes lets the show down slightly - it seems the budget for the animators seems to rise and fall depending on the importance of the arc. Some battles are brilliantly animated, such as the showdown between Luffy and Crocodile, leader of the Shichibukai, but many of the filler arcs look poor in comparison. However, this does not take anything away from the fact that One Piece is a masterpiece, with a quirky Japanese sense of humour and a narrative that can be appreciated by all, but loved only by some. My advice is to give it a try - if you're anything like me it will certainly captivate your interest, and then some.\\nQuick warning: stay WELL away from the 4KIDS English dub. They gutted the show, stripping it of many of its best features, and hired a voice cast that could test the sanity of anybody, be you 3 or 43. The lush orchestral musical score and lively J-pop intro has been replaced by awful faux hip-hop in order to market it to Americans, some of the blood is cut while some remains (this is NOT a gory anime by any stretch of the imagination - blood is used as more of an indicator that a fight has been going on a while), characters are renamed according to whim (Zoro is renamed Zolo, either to escape copyright infringement, give a closer transliteration from katakana, or just as an effort to be utterly, utterly lame), and there are some frankly ridiculous amendments - the one that really sticks out for me is Sanji's cigarette. Sanji likes to smoke, and he always has a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth. In the 4KIDS dub, this cigarette is replaced - in every frame - with a lollipop.\\nKaizoku-Fansubs (http://www.kaizoku-fansubs.com) make by FAR the best, most comprehensive, accurate and best-looking fansubs for this show, and episodes can be downloaded by BitTorrent or by XDCC transfer via IRC (#kaizoku-fansubs on irc.rizon.net).\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b0198fcfd6d33cdda0cfa8cf92c091ec'}>,\n",

The best way to evaluate anything is to read the negative reviews as well. This is a good rule to go by for anything (games, movies, appliances, etc) With that being said I'm not giving this series a 10.\\nQuick Review:\\n- Story (4/10) Its an infinite loop story, shounen boy being the greatest in the world and it follows him in all his wacky adventures.\\n- Art (6/10) It is indeed\\na very well animated series but you can easily see many common ways to for the studio to cut corners.\\n- Sound (8/10) Voice acting is top notch, everyone has a wide range of emotions but some overreact too much in one episode. Whats with all the yelling?\\n- Characters (7/10) You'll either love em or hate them (or both) Regardless you''ll have your share of favorites and luckily you will know all about them.\\n- Enjoyment (8/10) Main story arcs are great but what grinds it to a halt are the long drawn out situations in the vein of the Dragon Ball series.\\nFull Review:\\nI kept getting bugged and bugged about when i was going to pick this show up. Ever since 2004. Fast forward to 2008 and I finally picked up and started watching this show from episode 1. I started watching this show with very limited expectations since everyone keeps hyping the hell out of this show. And to be honest, the best way to watch this show is to have very low expectations. Because as soon as the story arc for obtaining Nami started (eps 031- 044), I definitely fell in love with this series.\\nThat story ark had everything a shounen anime should have, comedy, drama, action, and serious business. Basically an edge of your seat roller coaster ride trying to figure out what will happen next. Sadly, the story arc's like this are far and few between. The structuring of most arc's usually focus on one or two of the main characters which is perfect for a long running series like this. Don't get me wrong, alot of the adventures are good clean fun which most will enjoy. It's fine if there's no continuity what so ever and plot holes you can fill a 10 gallon trash bag in. It's all about over the top slapstick adventures and it does that well, even perfectly.\\nSo why in the hell did I give the story a score of 4? I could make a 10 page essay if I listed them all but the main issue is its whole premise. It is a LONG RUNNING shounen anime. That means they will do anything and everything to make a story arc as long as possible. A perfect example is that the opening AND closing credits will average between 90 to 150 seconds each, a last episode recap will last around 5 minutes , and a next week preview will last for about a minute. Add all that up and that roughly adds up to ~15 minutes of non essential story telling. FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Granted, new story arcs wont have as much time shaved off to start but the typical formula will repeat itself every time. But even then its like why bother watching last weeks episode if you can almost tell half of last weeks story today? Its an infinite loop that we're doomed to be in.\\nSince they are a long drawn out stories, they also suffer from the Dragon Ball virus. Having a face off between good guys and bad guys for 30+ episodes and essentially 'filling' in the time with flashbacks or side stories really insults the viewers intelligence in my opinion. They even have the gall to replay back story arcs that lasted upwards to 10 episodes and 'rehash' the arc into one or half an episode. I could have easily skipped over 260 episodes if i knew they were going to do that. I know it is to acclimate new young viewers to how their lovable characters came to be, but isnt that what dvd's are for? Or at the very least, don't bother to tie them in to a story arc.\\nOne more thing I must mention, try not to think too hard when people look like they're going to die one minute and the next, they're up and jumping around like nothing happens or any inconsistencies like that. It will make your head explode if you do.\\nIf you are willing to forgive the aforementioned problems with this show (or any long running shounen anime) I'm sure you will notice they do carve alot of nice stories that you will more than likely enjoy. As the actual stories told in the series just look so much fun. It's like watching Indiana Jones NONSTOP. Although it will take forever for them to tell you a story, you'll either be laughing crying or enjoying the wackiness that is One Piece.\\nThe creator did do a wonderful job of making VERY unique and non static characters, although some might appear typical or cookie cutter, they usually do something completely opposite or you will discover things you never thought would happen (inconsistencies aside). On top of that, the voice actors are very memorable and fit their characters awfully well. Although most of them yell more than i would like, the sheer number of cast members is staggering and is hard for me not to be impressed. I agree I am not a fan of a few of the main characters but knowing so much about them (due to side stories) its hard not to cheer for the straw hat crew!\\nThis series is far from perfect, but it is very enjoyable.\\n6.6\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b5e9e5769c03fcc0b289d32fc000ffea'}>,\n",

THE HORROR!!.\\nThe Basic story premise is about pirates with super fruity power ups known as Devil Fruits (Laughing excessively here at this point)\\nMore to It lies with our main character Monkey D Luffy a wannabe young man who wants to be king of the pirates.\\n(Wow had no idea there was royalty to begin with pirates but oh well)\\nLuffy strings up a group of people to join his pirate crew within different arcs of the story to help in searching for a treasure known as OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! that was foretold by the greatest pirate known as\\nGold D Rodgers who apparently hides the treasure in the Grand Line (because thats the name of the big game I guess?) and by the time our hair turns grey we might actually find out as to why and what it is, (that is either you or Oda stays alive until then.)\\nAt the time of Gold D Rodger\\'s death sentence he makes his last infinite statement that he says he left everything in OnePiIISSWuaaaa!\\nOh yes Gotta love that D eh Boys and Girls ?\\nSo far in the midst of everything the story tries its hardest to keep building up and gets messed up at an early point right after 50 episodes which was supposed to be its greatest strength but also becomes its greatest weakness.\\nYou probably wont believe me for saying this but that weakness being is WORLD BUILDING.\\nBasically what I mean by that is constant dragging on of episodes to make you feel that you are on a long journey of some sorts but in reality,\\nAll it really is doing is STALLING on the part of the mangaka Oda Eiichiro\\'s Art design and writing for whatever wage he seems to be earning on demand at the moment and yes its fact since the industry supposedly is hard on the condition of writers on a weekly basis. In other words the PACING OF THIS ANIME IS AWFUL.\\nSounds familiar?? Its pretty much very similar to Hunter X Hunter mangaka Togashi Yoshihiro\\'s approach in the story that constitutes for being excessively greedy in its approach, then again quite a lot of Shounen animes are like that I guess.\\nIts like the anime is holding up a sign saying:\\nHEY NOTICE US PLEASE!! PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF US! OR WE\\'LL KEEP SLOWING DOWN FOR WE SEEK THE ATTENTION!!!!\\nAnyway enough of the issue at hand before some of you start feeling like I\\'m trying too hard to be negative on purpose.\\nThink to yourself THIS, If this was such a great shounen for examples like death note or even FMA Brotherhood why the need for SO many episodes??\\nWhy am I so serious..??\\nvery simple answer, Again its World building! which demands many SLOW pacing in a lot of episodes, So much so that they probably need LOADS of spin off specials and movies like you haven\\'t watched enough of this already as it is in and outside of this franchise,\\n(also referring to Japanese one piece merchandise of course.)\\nby the time you get your toys at whatever time period this show continues, you ALL would of already grown out of this at some stage in your life unless your an Otaku then fair enough.\\nThis is No Rant here, I\\'m only stating the obvious critical point towards the show as a whole. But like I mentioned its because of this World Building this  leads to the major reason why the story at most becomes tedious and below mediocre at best on a consistent level in almost EVERY Arc.\\nOh and also FILLERS whether the fandom wants you to know or not know, there are a lot of filler characters which also includes badly forced gags for no progressive purposes except for you to question say \\'\\'Hey maybe I should watch something else for the time being,\\'\\' and me being an honest critic of this generation I will gladly say this, that You should not be force to be put through too much of the same stuff that you don\\'t really want to SEE in a long series like this.\\nCan we be honest and say for any anime watchers out there that loads of episode can harm World building because of timing and pacing problems such as this?\\nWhen you are chock full of content like this, it should be constructed and executed better! Never mind the BS on the whole it started in the 90s kinda nonsense.\\nYOU have the content for viewers to be engage in the show yet this anime stretches out the same shit you already witness before without some even realising it (Naruto I\\'m looking at you on this notion here).\\nSo don\\'t go into this series thinking there ain\\'t gonna be any fillers because I can most assure you there are, and quite a lot of them even if some of the extreme fandom don\\'t seem to believe so.\\nThe Art is okay and at the same time can look very BAD in terms of the details of a lot of characters. marines look stupid and quite similar to one another and just well fodder really,\\nfemales in this series turn out to have the same physique as every other hour glass shaped female in the show. wait is this fairy tail??\\n(Oh boy I might of hit the nail on that one)\\nBig tall men have extremely wide bodies and extremely skinny legs for no reason, at least whitebeard is the more convincing one out of them.\\nOther characters which includes non human characters look ridiculous and just too nonsensical to be taken seriously not matter what dragon ball like power they seem to possess.\\nalmost like I\\'m watching a Disney cartoon back in the day if it was on LSD.\\nand for the love of god why is usopp\\'s nose a DILDO??\\nI don\\'t care what third dimension of Disney this is suppose to be?\\nTHIS does not appeal to me thank you.\\nNow on to The Power schemes and structures of OnePiIISSWuaaaa! such as\\nParamecia:\\nBody manipulation over their own bodies, environment, or produce substances.\\nLogia:\\nhaving the power of natural elements or force of nature.\\nZoan:\\nTransformation of species and inter-species hybrid forms at will.\\nAh, you would think this category would be solid?\\nWhile some powers in the series I\\'ll admit can be used to good effect, others can look completely ridiculous and nonsensical even in their own category which for the most part makes the power balance of this series\\neven more unbalanced.\\nOh and lastly\\nHaki AKA (Haki of the Color of the Conquering King): Domination of the wills of others is the dumbest made up BULLSHIT! in the entirety of this franchise.\\n(Oh wow Conquerors Haki! OMG! That guy just looked at another person and that person fell DOWN!! OMG!!) seriously?\\nNO SERIOUSLY,\\nDon\\'t get me started talking about the different fighting styles in this series, its lame and not worth mentioning for they are like an excuse for characters that have to fight for the sake of having fights as their only true purpose and nothing more.\\nVillains in this show are typically One dimensional, There the kind of villains that like to displays cruel tendencies to other characters that you really wouldn\\'t care for,\\nBUT I guess because the straw hats appear (Oh Whoopie) You are force to unfortunately,\\nat times It can seem some what tiresome Especially if you are already familiar with this Shounen pattern again and again and again and AGAIN.\\nHow long has this series been going on for? (No Seriously)\\nSo now on to characters where the show for the most part kind of develops, but only due to back stories to further a fully purposed plot for them later on from the get go but it never really makes ground breaking attempts to carry along in this stride in every arc which is a real shame.\\nSo this wouldn\\'t really be shocking up to this point, ESPECIALLY if you have already watched a shit ton of episodes till the current episode you are at right now.\\nMain Characters The simple short version.\\nLuffy: IMO, as the Lead character he is one of the most uninspiring main character leads I\\'ve ever seen in shounen he has 2 fixated moods DUMBASS Or Constipated Raging Man child, Take your pick.\\nZoro: is useless in direction making the punt of his efforts in lots of situations where he is lost at every turn very stupid which in turn leaves his three swords style.\\nBut then who cares when you see characters like Killer Bee from naruto who uses his own 8 swords style So right off the bat what so impressive about this 3 swords style?, Haki Right?, \\'\\'the only answer to just about anything dumb in this show, thats cool I get it.\\'\\'\\nSanji: is basically Brock from pokemon as he is just a generic character who tries to be a hit with the ladies and never gets any including that he is also a chef and STILL never gets ANY WOMAN or PUSSY. Poor bastard.\\nFranky: I guess you can say he is the Cyborg technician of the ship who thinks he is SUPER MANLY but most of the time he is just a complete Super douche mentally and physically speaking.\\nNami: is Tragic navigator turned tragic Fan service. which gets dudes thirsting \\'\\'WHeres that nami Hentai at!!??\\nChopper: I don\\'t want to know any further about this annoying Doctor Yogi Bitch.\\nBrook: Probably my favourite straw-hat pirate out of them all but Oda sometimes devalues his character like others.\\nNico Robin: is Tomb Raider but with a cool ability if I might add.\\nAnd to be fair I liked the back stories of the characters.\\nHowever, what I didn\\'t like was over using the same sad theme for each of their themes with streams of over exaggerated tears. (talk about milking moments like these here to give people quickly them feels.)\\nwhich gets old really fast.\\nAs for the sound department, its lacking but by no means bad, it suits whatever mood you could be feeling in this long ass snail pace of a series. the voice acting quality were few and not so many.\\nAnimation wise Can look really decent when they put there time into it like marineford for example and a lot of other times can look pretty abysmal most of the time according to Toei Animation.\\nOverall am I enjoying this series? I am trying to, but because of those obvious glaring flaws on the surface still exist just like the treasure OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!!\\nI\\'ll admit I have put this on hold during the arc of Doh Flippin Flamingo because I still intend to finish what I started. otherwise why go in over 600 episodes deep just to drop it?\\nYou see I\\'m a watcher not a reader of forever long mangas so I intend to keep it that way plus I have no time for comparisons between the anime and manga I have better stuff to do in my long life so I leave you with this.\\nIf you want the most silliest longest Shounen adventure ongoing where everything changes with the times except this then by all means give this a shot you might end up loving it, just not in the same way it has been for me.\\nI can be sure I\\'m probably not the only one.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8d2b464a36bd7feeeddc11516b3b96ff'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one.\\nOne Piece, well i gotta be honest, I didn't like it at first. I thought that the voices were stupid and that it had really no plot whatsoever. This is all thanks to 4kids making the crappiest dub ever. I stopped watching it after, ep 20 or so, but then i heard to try it again using subs. I thought nah, it might sounds really stupid, but i still tried. After episode 20 or so, I was like &quot;WOW&quot;, this is awesome and from then on i was watching it non stop until\\nepisode 280 where i caught up. (yea i watched about 250+ episodes non stop) :D If you plan on watching it, watch it subbed please.  Well that's enough of that. Onwards.\\nStory\\nThe story is really amazing.  At first i didn't find anything entertaining, but I pressed on and continued watching. The plot is really amazing.  Its different from what most mangaka does, and that is power.  The story is all about achieving your dreams, getting nakama(companions/friends), and overall having a grand adventure. The story is original in a sense that it gives you a feeling of ease and hilarity when reading it. I for one, have always enjoyed a chapter and in each chapter is very powerful and/or funny.\\nArt\\nWell to be honest, I find the art interesting.  I mean its cool at times but then in some episodes its really crappy.  Thats probably the only thing I dont like.  But the fight scenes are amazing. The character design is very interesting and very original. The animation is pretty...crappy at times but that's to be expected in some animes. I mean not all of them would be amazing but there are quite a few that really have good animation. The animation for most fight scenes are really well drawn and intricate.\\nSound\\nI have only one thought for this. JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS OWN AMERICAN VOICE ACTORS. Seriously, they sound so much better and once you hear them, your instantly hooked to them.  4kids really did the crappiest dubbing ever, and that was mainly why i stopped watching it. Also their gum gum rap( american opening) was so terrible. Thanks to Funimation for at least making an &quot;ok&quot; dub. But subs are still the best. Their voices mesh with the characters personality so much that it's amazing.\\nCharacter\\nWow. The characters are really amazing. From the air-head captain to the greedy, money-loving navigator, it really is the most unique anime ever.  They are all different characters with all different dreams that power them throughout the show.  They all have alot in common, but really the biggest thing they have in common is that they all believe and support their captain, because he has saved them where they needed it the most.  Every character in One Piece is different from everyone and they are all entertaining. Every episode is funny and most of the time it is Luffy that makes it funny. Luffy is pretty much the most unique character made.  He is a simple minded captain who has no other thought other than one piece, his nakama, and MEAT. Yes meat, he loves meat,  but if you watch it you will learn that :p\\nEnjoyment\\nWell, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The fillers are much better than Naruto or Bleach fillers and they are alot more exciting.  Again the fight scences are amazing.  Every episode you will definitely laugh, because Oda-sensei (the mangaka- the one who made One Piece) is awesome.  He is pretty much the most creative mangaka, and the person i definitely want to meet.\\nOverall\\nOverall, I give One Piece a 10/10, well because it is pretty much amazing. The characters are very loveable, especially Luffy.  Every episode i laughed, every episode I was always at the edge of my seat.  If people tell you that One Piece sucks or that its not all that great, then don't listen! The only bad thing about One Piece is that 4kids made the dub first and then ruined it in America, don't listen and just watch it.  Listen to me and not them okay :D\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2dff53882b105fb1a17c1600f14676d9'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it.\\nNOTE: This is obviously not a bad-ass/cool-mysterious guy on a seemingly complex mission that is trying to mind-fuck you. This is SHOUNEN. Straight-forward and easy to understand for younger viewers and deep enough for the older. This is business as well as entertainment ei: MAINSTREAM.\\nSure it has a VERY generic shounen anime base-line but it has a lot more depth to it that only a mature audience can understand. This can\\'t be seen within the first 20 episodes; it\\'s one of those things where you have to grin and bare with. Most likely, your efforts\\nwould be worthwhile.\\nI\\'ll just follow the trend and comment on the sections; starting with the weakest qualities.\\n1. ART: (6/10)\\nThis is a HUGE issue and it takes a lot of perseverance and patience to get used to the art style of this anime. It took me about 6 months to get used to it.\\nAt first, everyone looked like overly-hyper, 12 year-olds being too loud and just looking at them made me want to stop. Noodle-like arms and legs, weird anatomy etc. the list goes on. But if you power through however long it takes for you to get used to the art, the characters appear as catalysts of nothing but pure emotion. This puts you in a weird, neutral position. You know that the art isn\\'t great but you can\\'t seem to imagine this series in any other way. Changing the art style becomes a bad idea.\\nThe only reason why I\\'m giving the art style a 6/10 is because it\\'s so damn hard to swallow. In the end, anime isn\\'t just eye-candy, it\\'s storytelling first and foremost and I think One Piece knows this very well.\\n2. SOUND: (8/10)\\nThe sound in this series isn\\'t bad but it isn\\'t spectacular though it does have golden moments during heavily emotional scenes. What IS fantastic is the seiyuu\\'s performances throughout this colossal series. They (generally) capture the essence of their characters, flaws and all. For example: The annoying idiot aspects of Luffy. Mayumi Tanaka was THE voice for Luffy. No one could fill her shoes.\\nThe opening themes usually sets the correct tone for the series; an up-beat, \"let\\'s go on an adventure\" kind of feeling. Corny? Maybe, Childish? Very, Effective? Absolutely.\\nFor what One Piece is and what it does; the sounds in the series definitely supports. It\\'s doesn\\'t suit my taste in music but it\\'s very \"One Piece\", which adds to the experience.\\n3. STORY: (10/10)\\nThe depth of this story will surprise anyone. I had very low expectations for this series, having started years after it began airing but after watching it for a while, I truly believe that this is one of the best shounen stories to date.\\nDespite being from a very obvious shounen base-line, One Piece delivers fantastically. One Piece explores society in a very extreme manner; often exaggerated to enhance the hype of the moment. You can see that this is deliberate because of how everything within the story drives to one particular moment.\\nI don\\'t think One Piece\\'s story should be compared to reality because it\\'s simply not realistic: It\\'s not supposed to be but we can certainly compare and relate the ideas and themes within the plot.\\nThis is a truly well thought-out plot, beautifully integrated with the characters to provide a very wholesome experience. If you sit there and watch it -searching for flaws- you will be missing the point of One Piece. If you approach it with a \"What the hell but whatever, lets see how this goes\" attitude, you are guaranteed to enjoy this plot more.\\nNOTE: Fillers are NOT stories, they fill empty spaces. That\\'s why they\\'re called \\'fillers\\'. They are meant to be half-assed to buy time for the author. You can\\'t judge a series by fillers, that just means you\\'re stupid.\\n4. CHARACTER: (10/10)\\nFirst impressions are important when it comes to characters. Unfortunately, One Piece fails at this and fails pretty hard. We are introduced to a very typical hero, off to be some king of something and be the biggest, baddest man on town: in this case, the world. Then we meet a typical tough-guy/Mr. Cool. etc.\\nThe thing that is amazing about the characters in One Piece is that though they appear very standard; they somehow manage to break their cookie-cutter mold. Each character basically has one strong quality about them but that one aspect of their character is what makes each character special.\\nThey then develop as the story progresses; being faced with challenges each character\\'s physical, mental and emotional state to their limits; tests their judgment and instincts. They are never perfect but it\\'s how they work around their shortcomings and utilize their few strong aspects to survive in the hostile world of One Piece, that puts the characters of One Piece in a league of their own.\\nOnce you get used to the whole atmosphere of this series, you will find that you won\\'t be able to help but feel very attached to almost every character you come across.\\n5. ENJOYMENT: (10/10)\\nIt\\'s fabulous. I can\\'t think of any other series with this much depth; in character design and the execution of the plot. There is a lot to read into in this series, people just need to take a deep breathe and allow themselves to be drowned and suffocated by it. It won\\'t kill you I promise.\\n6. OVERALL: (10/10)\\nI obviously love this series. It\\'s completely underrated and is constantly being flamed by \\'mature viewers\\' that think they\\'ve actually grown up just because they watch brain-raping anime with what SEEMS like a complicated plot when it\\'s actually just another generic anime to their related genre.\\nThis series deserves a lot more than that. It is worth the trouble of getting used to the painful art style. It is worth credit. There IS a reason why it\\'s popular.\\nWe, in the Western world tend to think that it\\'s mind-boggling to see that THIS is one of their most popular animes but I think it\\'s our arrogance and denial that is causing this negative reaction. Apparently, anime is just pretty colors, characters with big eyes and crazy hair, and big tits or a scifi-novel with moving pictures.\\nOne Piece is a fantastic combination of business, entertainment and art. It\\'s obvious why this series is such a success in it\\'s homeland. It\\'s just tragic how a disgrace to mankind (4Kids Entertainment) got hold of this gem before it could reach a wider audience.\\nThis is not a masterpiece; but it\\'s pretty damn close to being one.\\nThere is no such thing as a perfect show.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '839d694a0aa05bafef930854b514d331'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Ah, One Piece. The anime adaptation of the best selling manga in the world. I used to like this show when I first started watching it, but sadly I don\\'t feel the same way about it anymore.\\nSo One Piece is a battle shounen anime, which follows the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who aspires to be the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, a crew consisting of both men and women, who all play an important role that helps keep the crew going, and they all have their own goals.\\nLuffy is our typical, dumb shounen hero, who is\\na glutton, grins a lot, and is happy-go-lucky. He is a rubber man, whom can stretch parts of his body, gaining this ability after eating one of these \"Devil Fruits\" when he was younger. The rest of the Strawhat Pirates all have unique personalities, with their own quirks, and you\\'re likely to find a favourite among them. Although, some of them can be annoying sometimes.\\nThe art style is something you\\'ll either love or hate. It can be either appealing or unappealing to look at. In my case, I don\\'t have a problem with it, and that there are worse-looking anime than One Piece. It\\'s quite cartoony, and has a distinguishing look to it. It\\'s certainly a colourful anime throughout the series, with the exception of Thriller Bark, which is like a halloween-themed arc with dark colours being used instead of the usual bright. The designs of the Strawhat Pirates look fine, both pre-timeskip and post-timeskip, but I do prefer Nami\\'s sexier look she gets after the time-skip simply because she now has long hair. But the show also has some of the ugliest-looking supporting characters you will find in an anime.\\nThe animation is ass. Not gonna lie. Produced by the infamous Toei Animation, the animation is average and just looks outdated compared to other long-running anime that aired (or is airing) around the same time. It\\'s just disappointing and I know it could look better if another studio had done it, or if Toei put more budget into it like in the films. Along with this, the fights (which are mindless) just look unimpressive and are dull compared to the fights in other battle shounen anime like Naruto and Bleach, and it also uses a lot of still frames. There are also no fluid animation for the most important fights that happen in each arc. It\\'s just the same average animation they use for every episode. They never treat the viewers with flashy animation. Not even in the climax of an arc. Barely any of the fights are memorable, they don\\'t have strategy, nor do they have any rewatch value, and the choreography for the fights are just lame. This isn\\'t a show you want to watch for the fights.\\nThe sound effects are somewhat annoying. I personally hate the sound effect of a heart beating. It sounds gross and it doesn\\'t sound anything like a heartbeat. The music is a mixed bag. It\\'s upbeat most of the times, which goes well with the theme of the show. The first opening sounds amazing, and made me revisit the show frequently early on, but other openings are just painful to listen to. The main characters have their own theme music, which I always liked the idea of in anime in general, and they fit with the characters. The voice acting in both the sub and dub are great.\\nThe pacing is fine from episodes 2 to 301 (episode 1 was slow-paced), but it becomes permanently slow-paced starting from episode 302. Most of the filler episodes are surprisingly decent. Though in latter episodes, there are almost no filler episodes to speak of, which results in snail-pacing for the canon episodes. I think the anime should\\'ve taken a break for a year or two at that point so the manga chapters could pile up, or they could\\'ve made more filler arcs so the canon episodes would have better pacing.\\nThere are some things that have always annoyed me while watching this show, other than the fights. There is a lot of crying in it, from both main and supporting characters. Not only that, but they make these ugly, exaggerated expressions on their faces when they cry. It\\'s probably a staple of the show, but it feels like they went way overboard with the tears, and it got irritating the more I watched the show and hear them wailing. They cry so easily. Accompanying this is the constant melodrama. Hate that shit. It tries too hard to make the viewers cry. The characters tend to overreact to danger in an anime where nobody dies in it.\\nYes. There are a lack of deaths in this anime. Basically, for the most part, nobody dies in this show (outside of flashbacks). Like nobody. In an action show about pirates. This got noticeable the more I watched it, and this may be my biggest issue about this series. It just feels strange that a show like this to not have any deaths for hundreds of episodes. Like I wasn\\'t expecting any characters to die within the first 100 episodes or anything. And I also didn\\'t expect any of the main characters to kill people or die themselves (because of plot armour which is reasonable since they are main characters). But damn, does it take a long-ass time for the first actual death to take place in the show. I don\\'t mind lack of deaths in an action anime that has a realistic setting (Kenichi, for example, which is more focused on martial arts and delinquents as the bad guys, so you\\'re not expecting anyone to really die in a show like that). But One Piece has a fantasy setting, and honestly it\\'s unacceptable to me for a action/fantasy anime like this have virtually no deaths. Where\\'s the tension? What also irks me are the moments where the show makes it look like somebody has died, but later on you find out that they didn\\'t. In fact, there\\'s a moment in an episode where this specific supporting character should\\'ve died because what he was doing meant that he had zero chance of surviving, yet he lived. He was no longer relevant in the story after that moment, so why not kill him off? It is one of the most bullshit moments I\\'ve ever seen in an anime, and it made the character less memorable and less heroic. After realising how rare deaths are in this show, I just roll my eyes whenever a character, in a non-flashback scene, says that they\\'re going to kill or decapitate another character. And speaking of flashbacks, why do most of the characters have to have overly tragic backstories? I get it! They had it rough! Stop making me feel sorry for everyone!\\nI also don\\'t really like the humour; it\\'s just childish and involves slapstick and retorting. Things like Zoro getting lost all the time. In other words, it\\'s mostly unfunny, at least to me. And I just don\\'t like the general tone of the series. You often see these minor, nameless characters scream their lines to whatever is going on in front of them in a silly way in dramatic moments, and it\\'s pretty annoying. And the anime in general is a bit too goofy at times compared to other battle shounens, even if it is a comedy. I think Fairy Tail does it better when it comes to comedy in a battle shounen.\\nOverall, the main characters are the strongest aspect of One Piece, and is the biggest reason why I try to continue to watch the anime. I admit it\\'s fun to see the Strawhat crew\\'s adventures. It\\'s a pretty silly show, not taking itself seriously at all. I guess people like the show for the worldbuilding too. However, the abundance of melodrama might be a turn-off for some people. The arcs are also formulaic for the most part, so it gets repetitive too. If you have a lot of time on your hands, and like adventure, then consider checking this show out. If you\\'re looking for a battle shounen with spectacular fights, then I suggest you look elsewhere. The fights in One Piece are crap. I myself grew tired of watching this show after the Thriller Bark saga. The show peaks in the Marineford arc, and there\\'s little reason to continue watching this show after the timeskip. In fact, the first arc after the timeskip is one of the worst and most boring arcs I\\'ve ever seen, and I just wanted that arc to end as soon as possible. Honestly, I think the early episodes of One Piece, the East Blue Saga, are the best episodes.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ea8409d689792b0d23d86f40d2ca457d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"ONE PIECE EITHER GOING TO BE A LOVEABLE ANIME OR A HATEFUL ANIME FOR YOU. BELOW I WILL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING ONE PIECE.\\nStory\\nThe story is simple. It's somewhat drowned on most of the time. The fighting is ok and very entertaining to watch at times. On the other hand, the action is terrible compared to other anime. The most stupid thing is how Luffy just randomly pulls power out of nowhere when needed -.-. Let him lose properly, let us see him gain strength, not just randomly give him magic powers in the next episode. Hunter x Hunter is an excellent example of\\nshowing to the audience how Gon gained his strength.\\nOverall, the let-down is in between the start of the arc to the end, meaning pretty much the whole story. During these times, one piece finds a way to add lousy speech, action and can add a cheesy sad story to make the audience try to relate to it, just doesn't work. For this reason, I am giving the story 4/10\\nAnimation & Sound:\\nOne Piece animation is unique and can draw you in. The arts get better and better as the story progress. It's the same story with sound. However, you would expect the success of one piece would let it improve the animation standard to 2013/2014. It still lacks quality compared to animation that came years before now. For this reason, I am giving both of them 5/10\\nCharacters:\\nOne Piece universe has a wide range of characters. The main crew is fun to watch but also can be annoying at times. The downside is newer characters are just not getting their screen time worth. We don't want to wait for another 100 episodes to find another fact about them. Well, I guess they done it to drown the anime on. Another downside to characters I would say is the villains for Zoro. I mean, come on! One of the biggest badass in the anime, yet they can't even be bothered to create a more compelling character without a cheesy or disinteresting story to fight him. Overall I give it 5/10 for the inadequate background information on the characters we are given.\\nOverall:\\nOverall, if this is the first anime you chose to watch, you might enjoy. If you have seen other anime that set the bar high, such as FMA, then you will be disappointed. The newer arcs just feel like Oda is doing his best to try and rake in money rather than continuing putting soul into the anime.\\nHowever, I would say that it can be enjoyable for a younger audience or someone new to the anime world.\\nThe overall rating for the anime: 5/10\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b89f59594bc8050d7c1157aa3aa5be02'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'You know what I really miss? The good ol\\' days of shonen anime/manga where something could have an outrageously bizarre concept with an equally bizarre universe which can be light in tone and set the stage for some grand adventures to unfold. Nowadays, it seems like most shonen anime and manga try to be all dark and edgy in order to defy those sort of preconceived notions that all shonen anime and manga is light-hearted and/or childish. While that\\'s all fine and dandy, I can\\'t help but feel that we\\'re losing something special in the process of this sort of transition from light-hearted adventures to\\ndark and grim tales of survival.\\nWith the cancellation of the Hunter x Hunter anime (further compounded by the manga\\'s hiatus), it seems like brutal survival games chock full of fan service and outrageously violent battles are all that\\'s left of shonen series. Then enters One Piece: one of the most popular shonen anime/manga series out there which is still going strong despite being around for 15-something years. It\\'s had a lot of ups, downs, and more than its fair share of criticism levied against it but all things considered... it\\'s something like a breath of fresh air in this stale climate that shonen anime/manga seems to have immersed itself in as of late.\\n***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING***\\nOne Piece takes place in a world completely dominated by maritime travel that\\'s currently experiencing something known as the \"Golden Age of Pirates.\" The \"Golden Age\" was brought about by the death of the so-called Pirate King, Gold Roger and his final words about where he\\'s put his entire life\\'s fortune. Whosoever finds Gold Roger\\'s treasure, the eponymous \"One Piece\" will then become king of the pirates (or so the legend goes; I question how finding a dead man\\'s riches will automatically make you king of all maritime bandits, but that\\'s beside the point).\\nWhile many people might dismiss this concept as childish, this is one of the very things I love the most about One Piece. You want to know why? The reason why is that despite the simple set-up would seemingly get repetitive over a short span of time, Eiichiro Oda steps up to the plate and manages to deliver plenty of adventures that are so grand in scope that you\\'ll have a hard time trying to keep your jaw attached to your face. The way that Oda manages to so is quite clever and something that I never really get tired of: the fact that the Grand Line (the place where the vast majority of One Piece takes place in) is pretty much a perfect canvas to unleash his creative mind.\\nThe Grand Line is literally a place where common sense won\\'t get you anywhere. Conventional means of navigation are impossible because each island emits its own, strong magnetic field that interferes with regular compasses. Instead, you need a special compass called a \"log pose\" which basically leads you to the next island and that island is completely random. In addition to that, it takes a certain amount of time for the log pose to reset itself and lead you to the next island. The log pose can change at a moment\\'s notice, so you can\\'t even trust the calm of the seas or the weather. On that note, weather in the Grand Line is incredibly chaotic due to the irregular magnetic field that encompasses the entire area.\\nOn the topic of weather, every island in the Grand Line has its own climate, fauna, and such. Some islands are cloaked in perpetual winter while other islands are quite literally stuck in prehistoric times with dinosaurs and everything. Going back to the log pose, sometimes it can point you to seemingly impossible locations. Would you believe that there\\'s an entire arc in One Piece that takes place on an island IN THE FUCKING SKY?!?! I\\'m not even kidding. Whenever Eiichiro Oda puts his mind to it, he really can surprise you with what he can come up with. In fact, when it comes down to the world-building, only Fullmetal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter come close to matching it. Of course, One Piece and HxH opt for a sort of \"make it up as you go along\" approach while Fullmetal Alchemist is more carefully crafted.\\nA rather important part of One Piece\\'s universe is the existence of the so-called \"Devil Fruits.\" Whosoever devours one of these strange fruits will be given great power at the expense of their ability to swim. It should be noted that throughout the entirety of One Piece (thus far), there is absolutely NO explanation behind the mechanics of Devil Fruits and their effects on humans. Some people will undoubtedly take umbrage with this, but I don\\'t. One of the things that irritate me the most when it comes down to shonen anime and manga in recent years is the fact that there\\'s always NEEDS to be an explanation to EVERY SINGLE THING.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, there\\'s always going to be shit that will need explaining, but I find it infuriating whenever there has to be some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation given for practically EVERYTHING that happens to our characters whenever they gain/use a superpower. In One Piece, the Devil Fruit superpowers are indeed important but they\\'re not the overall focus of the plot. I suppose you can consider the Devil Fruit powers to be analogous to Nen from Hunter x Hunter or chakra from Naruto if you need something you can compare it to (even then, it\\'s not quite like those two). Another thing to note is that no two Devil Fruits will bestow the exact same power.\\n***THE STORY***\\nOne of the biggest problems that the One Piece anime suffers from is a VERY slow start. Like most shonen series, the story of One Piece is told arcs. The first 61 or so episodes encompass what I like to call the \"East Blue\" arc (which comprises of several smaller sub-arcs). Basically, it\\'s where Luffy is recruiting his crew and the various adventures that follow suit. By the end of Episode 31, the final crew member joins and the team is ready to set sail to the Grand Line... although that\\'s not quite the case. After Sanji joins the team, Nami briefly defects as we go into an arc that dives into her own back-story before she returns and becomes a permanent fixture of the Straw Hat pirates.\\nIt\\'s not that these episodes are bad or anything, but I just got done telling you all this amazing shit that happens in the previous section and yet none of that shit actually goes down until AFTER these episodes. Well... to be fair, these episodes were produced well over a decade ago when the manga itself was still rather young. I suppose it\\'s like Phantom Blood from Jojo\\'s Bizarre Adventure in the sense that it at least provides us with the foundation for these grand adventures to unfold. At the same time, I can\\'t help but feel like Toei Animation could\\'ve at least skipped over some of the more superfluous stuff from the manga. Whatever, it\\'s too late to do anything about that now.\\nAside from that, the story of One Piece is pretty damn good. For a series that\\'s been going on for well over 15 years, it\\'s surprising as to how consistent the overall story quality remains across the board. Yes, there are points where the storytelling takes a downturn, but this generally happens in filler arcs and whenever there\\'s some excruciating padding in an episode to stretch out the chapters (more in the next section). Of course, there are also moments whenever you can tell that Oda didn\\'t quite bring his A-game to the table in a particular arc. Yes, a man like Eiichiro Oda can also suffer from dry spells where his storytelling isn\\'t quite up-to-par with what he usually brings to the table. He IS human, after all.\\nConsidering that One Piece is a shonen series, it\\'s no surprise that themes of friendship and loyalty are quite prominent. What\\'s more is that in a vein similar to \"classic\" shonen series like Dragon Ball, it\\'s going to be a tale of adventure that is rather light in tone (for the most part). Does this mean that One Piece is automatically childish garbage? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Surprisingly enough, One Piece is fairly capable of taking itself seriously when the time comes for it to do so and what\\'s more is that friendship/loyalty will ALWAYS be themes no matter what since those are hallmarks of the genre. No sense in complaining about something that\\'s part of the course, you know...\\nThe overall arc structure of One Piece is fairly predictable, but that\\'s not an inherently bad thing since it does offer a degree of consistency with the storytelling. The basic formula generally goes like this: the Straw Hats land on an island -> residents of the island hate them -> the Straw Hats meet the island\\'s bad guy(s) -> they beat the bad guys -> residents of the island now love the Straw Hats. Keep in mind that this is simply the framework for an arc and the way an arc actually plays out may very well end up surprising you. This goes back to One Piece\\'s greatest strength: giving us amazing adventures that are so grand in scope to the point where you can\\'t look away from the screen for a moment.\\n***THE FILLER***\\nSurprisingly enough, Toei Animation did a relatively good job of remaining filler-free in a series as long as One Piece (roughly 98 episodes). It also helps that most of the filler arcs tend to be rather short (typically 2-5 episodes) across 670 episodes. It also helps that a good portion of them basically got their origins from ideas that Eiichiro Oda wanted to put in the manga but couldn\\'t for various reasons. But does that mean they\\'re worth watching? Well... I suppose you can go ahead and sit through the filler but the G8, Ice Hunter, and Ocean\\'s Dream arcs are the only ones that I consider worth watching since the other filler arcs tend to be more hit/miss.\\nGoing back to how Toei Animation mostly managed to subvert filler, it was through adaptation expansion. Eiichiro Oda is a guy who packs quite a lot of detail into his stories, so it\\'s easy for writers to expand upon concepts he brought up but didn\\'t quite flesh out. Unfortunately, Toei Animation has this nasty habit of taking things too far. While the adaptation expansion was good enough that occasionally bordered on great in the first half of the anime, the latter half of the series (Episode 405-onward) is where Toei Animation\\'s adaptation expansion takes a downward turn for the worse.\\nAfter the Sabaody arc, Toei Animation decided to up and scrap the idea for filler episodes entirely and instead adapt the chapters at a 1:1 ratio. Considering the fact that not every chapter will have ~20 minutes\\' worth of stuff to adapt, Toei Animation had to improvise and they did so by means of VERY excruciating padding. It REALLY got ridiculous in the Marineford arc where you\\'re basically panning over shots of the crew and have to put up with Buggy\\'s pitiful attempts at comedy. It even got to a point where they showed one character looking for milk before going back to a fight. Now with that said, it DOES get better and it\\'s really noticeable after the time skip but it\\'s too little, too late by that point since the time skip is fairly recent (around episode 515?).\\n***THE CHARACTERS***\\nConsidering the fact that One Piece has been going on for 15+ years, it\\'s no surprise that there would be a LOT of characters. A good deal of them show up later on in the show/manga\\'s run, but the vast majority of them are more or less just there for one arc before the focus of the story shifts to the next arc. Surprisingly enough though, even characters that have been around for just one arc were fairly well-developed and rather likeable like Dr. Kureha whose only appearance is in the Drum Island arc. There are certain characters who stick around with the Straw Hats for more than one arc (i.e. Vivi), but they\\'re few and far between. Despite that, they receive more than enough screen time to the point where you feel like something\\'s missing once the time comes for them to depart.\\nFor the vast majority of One Piece, we\\'re stuck with the Straw Hat pirates: a rag-tag bunch of misfits with their own share of issues that also have such large bounties on their heads that rival Vash the Stampede\\'s. The leader of the Straw Hats is none other than the rubbery Monkey D. Luffy. For lack of better words, Luffy is well... an idiot. What\\'s more is that he\\'s a gluttonous idiot in a vein similar to Goku or Naruto but thankfully he\\'s not THAT extreme. A good benchmark as to how much you\\'ll like Luffy is how well you can tolerate his airhead behaviour since it does get rather ridiculous at times. Regardless, he\\'s got quite a few good traits to back him up and without Luffy, there would be no adventure, which would fucking SUCK.\\nMy favourite character would definitely have to be a tie between Roronoa Zoro (the swordsman) and Sanji (the chef). Why? Well... it\\'s a combination of cool factor AND the fact that they play off of each other (and Luffy) rather well. I just can\\'t get enough of their constant snark toward one another, nor can I ever get enough of Zoro\\'s santoryu (3-sword style) or Sanji\\'s ridiculously powerful kicks. That\\'s not to say that the rest of the Straw Hats are forgettable, boring, or whatever because that is NOT the case at all. What I love most about the Straw Hats is that despite the predominant focus on Luffy, each member receives a good amount of development and time to shine on-screen.\\nOf course, what are protagonists without their villains? Suffice it to say, Eiichiro Oda\\'s creativity leads to us having quite a lot of interesting villains. Some of them are fucking AWESOME (like Enel in the Skypiea arc) while others are well... lame and stupid (like Buggy in the Orange Town arc). Honestly, this is something you\\'ll have to put up with over the course of One Piece. You think that a limitless well of creativity is free? Oh fuck no! While Eiichiro Oda manages to hit the mark 95% of the time, there are moments where you have to put up with some of his ideas for villains that aren\\'t stupid in an awesome way but are instead just well... stupid (ref: Buggy). Thankfully, arc villains aren\\'t the only ones that the Straw Hats have to deal with.\\nConsidering the fact that the Grand Line is so vast in scope, there are a LOT of threats that the Straw Hats have to put up with, two of which being the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The Marines are essentially your maritime police force which deals with pirates while the Seven Warlords are essentially government-sanctioned pirates. In exchange for a cut of the treasure that the Seven Warlords find, the government allows them to basically pick off smaller pirate ships that try to traverse through the Grand Line. Whenever an arc deals with one of the Seven Warlords, there\\'s no doubt that it will be intense.\\n***THE ART AND ANIMATION***\\nIf the seemingly childish concept, Luffy\\'s stupidity, or the sheer length won\\'t repulse you, chances are that the artwork will make or break your overall experience. Personally, I feel like Eiichiro Oda\\'s artwork has quite a unique charm to it. What I love most about it is that there isn\\'t a single anime/manga series out there that has this exact art style (and before you say anything, Fairy Tail does NOT count). I can understand why some people wouldn\\'t like it since it\\'s rather cartoony and most shonen series nowadays tend to have realistic character designs. Regardless, Hunter x Hunter has a similar \"cartoony\" art style and yet people praise the everliving Christ out of it so if you\\'re gonna talk smack about One Piece\\'s artwork but not levy the same criticism against Hunter x Hunter, you\\'re too stupid for words.\\nOf course... there is one little gripe I have with the art style and that is the fan service. Seriously... One Piece\\'s fan service is something that I can never quite get accustomed to despite having watched the anime AND read the manga for well over 6-7 years. Maybe it\\'s just me, but I really don\\'t find huge tits on top of a skinny waist and lanky limbs to be that attractive. If that weren\\'t bad enough, post-timeskip Nami\\'s outfit is essentially a bikini-top and low-riding pants. Come on, Oda! You expect me to believe that Nami just went through a growth spurt? Don\\'t lie, she paid Chopper to give her a boob job and you know it. Same goes for Nico as well! But, I digress. While I can certainly complain about it all I want, the fan service isn\\'t as bad as OTHER popular shonen series (i.e. Akame ga Kill, Fairy Tail).\\nAs for the actual animation itself, it pains me to say that Toei Animation doesn\\'t really have that good of a track record when it comes down to animation quality because they have this nasty habit of producing several long-running anime series alongside one another as they\\'re airing while rotating between animation teams that tend to vary wildly in terms of quality. There\\'s a tendency to go off model every few episodes and it\\'s actually gotten a lot sloppier in the more recent episodes with character proportioning changing at the drop of a hat (let\\'s hope that these animation errors get fixed in an upcoming Blu-ray release or something).\\nThe first 206 episodes were more or less par for the course from Toei Animation. There was a lot of good, a good deal of penny pinching along the way, fights were decently animated but nothing worth getting excited over, etc. Episode 207 is when the show makes the switch to HD and a 16:9 resolution and from that point forward, the animation became more fluid and the artwork became a lot cleaner as it ditched some of the line effects and such that it used in the earlier episodes. A general rule of thumb I use is that if an episode I\\'m watching on Funimation\\'s website has been dubbed, I\\'ll watch the dub instead because dubbed anime generally uses the footage AFTER it\\'s been cleaned up of most of its off-model errors.\\n***THE SOUNDTRACK***\\nUnfortunately, there wasn\\'t a lot about One Piece\\'s OST that really caught the fancy of my ears which is quite bizarre since there\\'s usually one or two pieces of BGM that would stand out to my ears while watching. The OP/ED themes are fair enough, and I do have a fondness for a few of them (although I forget their numbers and I\\'m WAY too lazy to look them up at this point). I will say this though: Skypiea had some pretty damn good BGM even though I couldn\\'t remember any specific tracks that stood out.\\n***THE DUBS***\\nIf you\\'ve ever done a basic Google search on One Piece, you\\'ll probably find out that it had a rather turbulent distribution history here in the USA. It was initially picked up by 4Kids Entertainment and was aired on FOX during Saturday mornings (only to eventually air on Toonami during Saturday nights). Unfortunately, 4Kids has this nasty habit of editing the anime they license WAY past the point of compliance with FCC guidelines. For a full list of 4Kids edits, you can Google it. Most One Piece fans will urge you to stay away from the dub and honestly... I can\\'t really blame them for that (especially now, since Funimation has been distributing One Piece for damn near 7 years and their dub is significantly better).\\nBut if we were to take away the content edits that 4Kids was responsible for and focus solely on the actual dubbing, you\\'d be quite surprised. The actual dubbing isn\\'t quite bad and if you want a real surprise, Marc Diraison (the voice of Guts in the English dub of Berserk) voices Roronoa Zoro in the 4Kids dub of One Piece. It\\'s no stretch of the imagination to think that he\\'s my favourite performance in the entire dub. Erica Schroeder, the voice of Luffy did a fair enough job in her role but some of her lines came off as a bit forced and unnatural (although I blame the ADR director for that, since the woman really is a talented voice actress).\\nAs for the Funimation dub, I\\'d have to say that it\\'s pretty damn good stuff. It\\'s common to hear dub haters say that Colleen Clinkenbeard as Luffy and Brina Palencia as Tony Tony Chopper make their ears bleed, but that judgement is really left up to you. Both Clinkenbeard and Palencia do a great job with the roles they\\'ve been given, but I will concede that they can get rather irritating at times (of course, I blame the characters since their voices can be grating in the Japanese dub too). However, my favourite performances would definitely have to be Luci Christian as Nami and Christopher Sabat as Zoro (although I wish that Marc Diraison was still Zoro\\'s voice actor because Guts). It\\'s nice to hear Luci Christian\\'s regular voice and Christopher Sabat not being a large ham and I wish more Funi dubs would play them straight rather than having Christian and Sabat doing exaggerated roles.\\n***ANIME VS. MANGA/HOW TO WATCH***\\nWhen it comes down to anime vs. manga, the manga always wins hands-down for one simple reason: lack of padding. Were it not for Toei Animation\\'s overuse of padding, I\\'d heartily recommend the anime over the manga since it does have quite a lot going for it. However, it should be noted that you can alternate between the anime and the manga so that you don\\'t have to plough through 760+ chapters or spend 6 months trying to catch up to the One Piece anime. Thankfully, the One Piece wikia can tell you what chapter(s) the episode you\\'re watching is adapting and vice-versa.\\nRather than sitting through the first 61 episodes, what I recommend is reading the first 100 or so chapters from the manga (it\\'s not as much as it sounds, trust me) and then moving over to the anime at Episode 62. If you ever feel like an episode is dragging on in pace, look up the episode on the One Piece wikia and see what chapter(s) it\\'s adapting, then go ahead and read the corresponding chapter so you don\\'t have to sit through 20+ minutes of something that you could easily read in less than 3-4 minutes. If you feel like the chapter you\\'re reading is confusing or whatever, look it up on the One Piece wiki and then watch the corresponding episode. It\\'s as simple as that, really. What made you think you had to sit through all 670+ episodes to begin with? The manga does exist for a reason.\\n***FINAL THOUGHTS***\\nOn the whole, One Piece is a very interesting beast to tackle. I like to imagine One Piece as the boss of the Big 3 with Naruto and Bleach standing by its side as its bumbling and incompetent henchmen. While the sheer episode count and turbulent distribution history may put you off from watching it, don\\'t let that scare you. Whereas Studio Pierrot only began adapting Naruto and Bleach in 2005, One Piece has been going on since 1999 so of course there\\'s going to be a stark difference in terms of episode count. For a series that\\'s been going on for 15 years and counting with no end in sight any time soon, it\\'s amazing as to how Eiichiro Oda is able to keep up this level of creativity. Are there low points? Of course, but thankfully they aren\\'t THAT low and are instead very brief. Don\\'t buy into the hate against this series since it\\'s actually quite lovely.\\n***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS***\\n1) Hunter x Hunter (2011)\\n- The bonds between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are similar to the bonds shared between the Straw Hat pirates and what\\'s more is that they both take place in bizarre worlds where fanciful occupations set the stage for tales of grand adventures just waiting to unfold.\\n2) InuYasha\\n- Both InuYasha and One Piece are more about the journey rather than the destination itself. Both shows comprise of large arcs that are split up between many smaller, easy-to-watch sub-arcs and standalone episodes. Both shows also put a lot of emphasis on friendship and trust (although InuYasha does so for different reasons; it IS a partially romantic story, after all).', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '69c2477820cf38e942b78b1ae72011d1'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Straw Hats. More like straw caricatures. Over 600 episodes in, even after a time skip, and despite momentary spurts of ambition, the whole cast is still overdosing on lead and at least 2 standard deviations below average intelligence. Luffy has clinical ADHD and could not focus on a single thing to save his life -- literally. He constantly blurts out things he shouldn't, have trouble expressing himself beyond first grade vocabulary, and grins and tee-hees at everything. Sanji still gets trapped by every woman he sees. It's a broken record, and what's more insulting is when enemies get persuaded by the feelings of this genuine\\nfuckboy. Zoro still blanks out and gets lost on literally every island he ever lands on, as if his role is to drag each arc out 20 episodes longer than it would have been without him. The rest of the cast, despite growing in power and taking their stand when they have to, continue to cower in fear and run away just to buy time.\\nOne Piece took the best from DBZ and Bleach -- in terms of wasting time. Every shot sits a few seconds longer, panning the uninteresting backgrounds. Characters stare at each other with no improvement, while others commenting on things that we see in plain sight, like perpetual straight men of a manzai duo without a joke. Plot threads shift between the crew, who all manage to separate themselves with each arc, wasting frictional time (a favorite in Bleach). Repetitive frames of crowd reactions (e.g. 10 times of a 3 second clip of the same people cheering within an episode). The opening sequences end with a speech by Luffy declaring his aim to be Pirate King, a review of the previous episode, and then the title -- all of which take up between 4-6 minutes of a 22 minute episode.\\nBut more insulting is the piss poor writing that requires every character, heroes and villains alike, to take actions that no reasonable person would take, trusting the words of people no reasonable person would trust, giving people benefit of the doubt, following strangers for no reason, revealing their identities in a covert mission for no reason, and figuring out the sob stories of every child like Michael Jackson in Neverland. Let's be frank. All this serves one purpose and one purpose only. To drag out the episodes as much as possible.\\nAnd over hundreds of episodes, we see exactly what's going on. Each arc has the same predictable structure, wherein Sanji harasses another woman and Zoro gets lost and Usopp runs away and Luffy does something stupid, and invariably they all end up uncovering the sob story of another Naruto-filler-like child. What's more disingenuous is that this sob story is not actually about any of the characters -- ever -- but a thinly veiled political spiel about a different topic per arc: environmentalism, class, race, etc. We could put this show on pause half way through any of the dialogue and guess exactly what dumbass Sanji or Luffy would say next. It's insulting that anyone thinks this is good writing, to provide skin-shallow analogies by use of emotionally fake expositions. The protagonists get mad but could never seem to explain why.\\nSo with all this time wasting, instead of villains of the week, we get villains of the season. And each arc marks a plot reset where Luffy retains his level-ups (i.e. gears) but loses all his gained creativity. In the Arabasta arc, Luffy flicks his arms to make the attacks less predictable to fool the villain. In another arc, he uses the ground as an indirect weapon to attack someone he couldn't touch. There are a number of these clever innovations that give us hope of all the awesomeness that might lie ahead, but Luffy forgets every one of them after the end of each arc like Barakamon's calligraphy. It's truly a long-running shounen in that sense. There's no plot -- well, if by plot you mean Goku gaining more power level or Ichigo getting in touch of a new supernatural aspect of himself, then I guess you could construe a plot. Luffy does gain higher bounties, which is the only thing he carries in between arcs.\\nSo between the crap characters, the template stories, the repetitive animations, what can we make of this? It's an artist that sold out to the status, plain and simple. It's the studio trying to keep a good thing running past its time.\\nFans of the show love the sob story flashbacks for the same reason they must love all the depressive angst of Naruto, but in my view anyone who wants more depth -- that's right, MORE depth, not less depth -- should SKIP the flashbacks and just watch the first few episodes of an arc, then skip to the end to where the fights pick up. Save yourself 80% of the time on insipid development and crocodile tears, and just infer what happens with your imagination, which is surely more copious than Oda-sensei's. Hopefully your imagination doesn't require a starving African child to get people to care about the plot.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f5f246374cef39cdcbbb159c59ade570'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Sidonia no Kishi is truly a marvel. When I began the first episode and laid my eyes on the CGI, I felt a bit underwhelmed and my opinion  began to waver on the show; However, SnK soon made me realize that I could have never been so wrong and I'm glad for that. Sidonia no Kishi is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi anime where everyday mankind lives in fear of being decimated, but continues to survive on an enormous ship known as Sidonia. There struggle is against an alien-species known as the Gauna which have brought humanity to its knees before and the only thing between\\nthem and Sidonia are the pilots of the Gardes(mechs) whom protect Sidonia. This setting is not necessarily new, but the way it is handled and presented  can only be said to be top-notch.\\nStory (9/10):\\nThe story sets itself for excitement, thrills and edge of your seat action which is all done masterfully in SnK. Considering humanity could be on the brink of being destroyed on a daily basis there should really never be a dull moment and there never was. Even at times when the scene was supposed to ease the tension or be a bit more heart-warming not once did it lose my interest. The sci-fi played a huge role when showing off technological advancements and it's thanks to this and the anime's emphasis on it which made it only that much more interesting. Every single moment had its intensity, the plot would constantly mesmerize you with excitement, but evens it out superbly with some comedy and scenes to ease the tension before throwing you back in the action again. The story has been done many times over, but not a lot could match up with what Sidonia no Kishi brought to the table.\\nArt (9/10):\\nThe world is brought to life using CGI which is what gave me the first impression that it would be underwhelming. In-fact, I felt rather unsettled seeing the CGI, but moving forward giving the anime a chance I realized there would be no Sidonia no Kishi without it. The CGI is used masterfully for every scene and whenever it was time to buckle up and fly into the heat of battle the action was on a completely different level from anything else thanks to it. While it did take some getting used to for when we were simply watching our characters walking around, it became no problem soon enough and well worth it to just see the Gardes in action.\\nSound (10/10):\\nThe sound completely exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend if you have a pair of fantastic headphones, use them. The quality of the sound during the encounters versus the Gauna were some of the best I have ever heard. Once I put on my headset and listened, I was completely immersed. The engines roaring, weapons firing and so-on, you could tell the studio payed especially close attention to the details and it was phenomenal.\\nCharacter(8/10):\\nThe characters in SnK were very interesting. While I cannot say they were completely original they each had unique characteristics to separate themselves from most other characters. Each character evolved in his or her own way and it was fantastic to see some of the interactions between them after the course of some events had taken place. It's really thanks to the sci-fi setting that allows for such diversity among them and while you may not appreciate every character; Each character we're introduced to have their own role in the story and I cannot deny that it's thanks to what can be created within the sci-fi setting which makes each of them only that more intriguing.\\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\nSidonia no Kishi had done everything completely right in my eyes when it came to entertainment. Every episode had a huge significance and would leave you with an aching appetite for more. Every time the Gardes had flown off into battle I was completely overjoyed with excitement and even in the more relaxing scenes I was still just taken aback by all the twists the plot had taken along with the progression. For an anime to be able to succeed in capturing the audiences attention every single episode is a grand feat.\\nOverall (9/10):\\nSidonia no Kishi is an amazing anime that should not simply be overlooked. The CGI, while may take some getting used to for some, is an integral part of the anime and those whom give it a chance will see why. Even for those with a dislike of mecha I'd recommend this to as the major focus on character interactions, fantastic sound and breath-taking action all put into one package makes this one of the greater Sci-fi mecha anime out there to look out for. Out of all 12 episodes there was not one that was uneventful and it continued strong from start to finish.\\nSo what are you waiting for pilot? Suit up, it's time for the Knights of Sidonia to move out.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bfd80329ed311558c04a329d4848e292'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"So when I first found out that there was not only a manga but also an anime with the same title (yet spelled differently) as my favorite song by Muse, I felt the need to check out what it was. So of course when I first started watching the show I was pretty pumped to find the same kind of popcorn action that I would get while watching a film like the Star Wars saga or reading a novel like Ender's Game. I did get the show that provided me with that kind of action, but that's just it; I got EXACTLY what I expected\\nand I wasn't blown away in any way. Knights of Sidonia is definitely that kind of blockbuster spaceships and explosions fun you would want in an anime, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table and ends up being a steaming mishmash of vapid and under cooked sci-fi tropes that were cool to watch but didn't light me up in any way along with a plot that moves to fast to fit everything in. However I am willing to overlook some of the production values that I consider subjectively bad if I get around to watching the recently planned season 2 or find copies of the manga.\\nThe first aspect of the show that I was rather taken aback by was the use of 3D animation instead of traditionally drawn shows. I was really turned off by the stale looking world and characters at first, but I think it honestly grew on me and most reminded me of the corridors of the video game Dead Space (minus all the bone-cracking gore and alien enemies that experience provided) and the seed ship Sidonia, all its inhabitants, and the overall look of the set pieces has an interesting, pristine feel to them and it almost felt like it could be the real interior of a space vessel. In addition to that, the space battles were not only the best aspect of the show, but they looked really cool too, and I as the viewer really got the feel that the Gardes, pilots and commanders were not only fighting the Gauna, but the massive size of Sidonia and space itself. An area where the animation took somewhat of a nose dive would be in the case of the characters; they all look eerily the same, and it was highly jarring dealing with several characters that looked the same at first. Granted I could tell who Tanikaze was (but that was mostly because of JYB's voice), but until the characters were singled out and focused upon more, Yuhata and Norio were simply Green-Haired Girl and Sephiroth Wannabe. Then Hoshijiro got introduced with Izana to quickly follow, and there was a moment where I thought they were the same person, and so seeing them both on the screen at the same time was more jarring than it should have been.\\nSo while the animation was here and there and the fight scenes were awesome, many elements of the plot and characters suffer from being cardboard cutouts and aforementioned sci-fi staple tropes that didn't make Knights of Sidonia stand out as much as I had hoped it would. But first lets talk about the good. Whenever the characters get lost or they encounter a Gauna, they need to make the trek through space using just the right strategy to get back or they won't survive, and they made up for some pretty intense moments in the show that weren't the amazing fight sequences. The other interesting aspect that the show expressed was how much pressure the humans were under in order to squelch and survive such as photosynthesizing instead of eating and putting on gravity belts whenever the ship turned were both useful and interesting elements to the show.\\nHowever, most of the plot and character personalities I feel were overused and have been done better in other places. Tanikaze is a very staple main character, and the fact that he's this 'chosen one' pilot that can use the 'best garde' really has no purpose other than the fact that he's the underdog and we as the audience were supposed to root for his struggle, I guess. The other thing that bothered me about his character is that he got in trouble trying to steal food and got caught meddling in top secret government stuff and didn't get prosecuted for either. This is why the 'chosen one' trope that is Tanikaze is didn't make the drive of the show interesting; he's boring, rigid and doesn't develop much at all. As for most of the other characters are those kinds that only have one personality trait or motive: Yuhata is smart, sweet, and likes Tanikaze. Hoshijiro: same, Izana: Same. Then there's the endless stream of Red Shirts that like Tanikaze because he's Tanikaze, and the immortal council members who are mysterious and cold for the sake of being mysterious and cold, and Norio is the cranky bitter guy. I'm listing them as such because I feel like that's really all there is to them. When they die there's no weight. When there's love, it's forced. When there's action, they just support Tanikaze.\\nAnd of course while I adore sci-fi and the bright flashy robot and alien fights were the point of no return where the analytic part of my brain goes to die, the rest of what makes sci-fi interesting; cloning, ship building, prosthetic robot stuff, talking animals and human preservation technology, it's all cool, but it has to have a point. I ended up having more questions than I had answers about stuff the show made up itself, and for the use of sci-fi tropes that I had seen before, I had seen them being used in a better way. Some of the new stuff that was brought to the table was the aforementioned (and well done) photosynthesis vs. food idea, and the giant talking bear. Why? Why is it here? Why is the immortal council so cold? Why are they trying to hide the Gauna-human hybrid from Tanikaze even though they told him what it was when they asked? I had far too many questions left unanswered, and it put a damper on the enjoyment of the show as good writing to me is all about what to write and when. Of course all of this can be overlooked if the manga or season 2 will fill in some of these blanks for me.\\nEven if had a lot of complaints resulting in my opinion on Knights of Sidonia being average to good, it was still an enjoyable watch if you do like sci-fi. Sure a lot of the show can be criticized but if you're there to watch it for fun and not for analysis, I would highly recommend it to you. However if you're looking for something more that robot and alien flashy colors and lasergun fights with a pinch of melodrama and scifi cliches inbetween, I'd stay away.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bd2123fee50f8ab060f36fbc1cf6b31d'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'When certain premises in anime are overused without variation they\\'re quickly labeled as \"run of the mill\".. Like dystopian with mecha. Because of that many anime try to change minute details regarding the setting or premise to stand apart. However, if something normally considered \"run of the mill\" is executed with proper care it can be seen as rather refreshing. Knights of Sidonia is a rare case, not quite falling towards being called mediocre nor does it fall towards refreshing. Rather it all depends on the individual to make the judgement call.\\nStory: 6/10\\nSet in the distant future, the story takes place upon a spaceship\\nwhere the lone surviving civilization of humanity live in a stagnant state of unrest due to the attacks of giant ominous creatures known only  as \"Gauna\". These creatures are rather interesting as they seem to have the ability to mimic the action and appearance of things they encounter, giving them an eerie presence as the series progresses.\\nDue to these frequent attacks by the Gauna the story never feel bogged down to a slow paced narrative. This makes for good binge watching material as your curiosity pushes you to one episode after the next. Despite the pace being powered by propane the tone of the series is all over the place. The story goes from \"Shingeki no Kyojin in space\" to \" let\\'s build a harem\" at a drop of a hat . This can be very off putting at times but it\\'s slowly resolved back to an even tone towards the show\\'s midpoint.\\nArt: 6/10\\nit\\'s hard to judge the art for this anime. It\\'s a mixture of both CGI and cell shaded animation. The CGI is rather jarring upon 1st encounter but quickly becomes tolerable as you become immersed in the show\\'s setting. On normal occasions if someone were to tell me to watch a show composed entirely of CGI, I would probably think \"well this is gonna be some ugly shit\" but in this case it works. In fact I think it\\'s safe to say that the CGI gives Knights of Sidonia it\\'s special signature. This is especially true for the fight sequences. However when the focus are on the characters, their movements feel artificial and stiff. It\\'s also obvious that recycled footage were used during the launch sequences and team formation. The flaws are too noticeable to ignore and ultimately impedes on the score from being higher.\\nSound: 7/10\\nThe music score is virtually nonexistent. It\\'s all muddled together with very little difference separating them. Only standout were the ones played during Gauna encounters.. The opening song however is one worth noting. I has an orchestral tone while still being rather tranquil, making it one that you simply can\\'t skip. Voice actors all perform their roles with no hiccups but there wasn\\'t any standouts that come to mind.  The only other standout being the sound affects pertaining to the lasers (heigus cannon), thrusters and other devices used.\\nCharacter: 3/10\\nThe characters are all a dismal mess. None of them receive any decent characterization. Our main character is basically another \"self insert\" protagonist with little personality to speak of and is good at everything he does. Basically he\\'s the vanilla of most MCs coming out today and can easily be replaced by one of many other series with no difference noticed.\\nthe antagonist Kunato, upon 1st introduction seemed 1 note. Before he even muttered a word you already know he was going to be the \\'arrogant, rich, short tempered douche \\'.. But surprisingly he becomes the only character with decent characterization. As the show progresses it also becomes easier to  sympathize with him.\\nAnd finally a plethora of females! Because what\\'s a harem without some right? But seriously there\\'s only two female characters worth mentioning and that\\'s Izana & Hoshijiro (Izana being non gender but I digress). Both of which have no real characterization beyond being 1 dimensional archetypes but they do get a more screentime than the rest.\\nOH YEAH! there\\'s also a talking bear with a robot hand that we never get a proper explanation for but we\\'ll ignore that lol\\nenjoyment: 7/10\\ndespite this show\\'s numerous flaws it\\'s an enjoyable watch for those looking for a sci-fi popcorn flick. The characters were nothing special but the story carried it.\\nOverall: 6/10\\nThis anime is made to be enjoyed by the casual viewing masses and is an easy watch. However seasonal anime fans will notice the overused tropes and archetypes in a heartbeat and that might be the deciding factor on whether they like it or think it\\'s mediocre. Either way the series to the very least was entertaining with little down time to speak of and can be easily finished in one sitting. With that in mind I recommend giving this one a go.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e737602e534e23172c41b9df39725473'}>,\n",

This anime is directed by Kobun Shizuno from Polygon Pictures and it is an adaptation from Nihei\\'s manga \"Knights of Sidonia\". As you may know, Nihei Tsutomu specializes in cyperpunk genre manga like for example, BLAME & Biomega.\\nThis anime reminds me of Gravity the movie.\\nSTORY (9):\\nThe story takes place\\nin the future where Earth is destroyed by monsters called Gauna, and mankind has to flee from Earth. Each Gauna has a core that is protected by the placenta, and once the placenta and core are destroyed, the Gauna\\'s body disintegrate. In order to stop the Gauna,\\nThe story follows a similar idea of Attack on Titan where human is on the verge of extinction. \"Attack on Titan\" villains are  the Titans while \"Sidonia no Kishi\" villains are the Gauna.\\nSpace is big and beautiful but it can be frightening.\\nThis anime also shows that not all tactics can work. Just like in any action anime, some tactics can have benefits and problems. Just like gravity can sometimes affect the performance in the final episode.\\nI did like the way how the story handles the characters. Imagine surviving in outer space with no oxygen or air or water like in episode 5, where Tanikaze & Hoshijiro are stuck in outer space. In order to survive in outer space, you need oxygen tank and lots of food and drinks supply.\\nI also liked how the robots form in circles to show union.\\nART (10):\\nA lot of people are annoyed by the usage of CGs. However, this anime managed to handle the CG well, making the animation look stellar. This anime uses 3D animation.\\nSOUND (10):\\nSeriously, I loved the opening song \"Sidonia\" by Angela. This song plays a tone that displays courage and bravery. I also liked the ending song \"Show\" by Eri Kitamura. The ending song plays in a rock and roll tune.\\nAngela also sang some songs like the opening of Coppelion \"Angel\". Eri Kitamura is also a voice actresses in some roles she has done like Eve from NEEDLESS.\\nCHARACTER (9):\\nI liked the way how they handle the characters. At least they never show me any annoying traits.\\nTanikaze Nagate was the type of character who always try to do his best no matter what happens. I thought at first he was like a wimp, but surprisingly he really develops as a character from there on.\\nIzana Shinatose is also a decent character who also tries to help Nagate as possible as she can.\\nLala Hiyama was the type who also supports Nagate just like a real mother.\\nShizuka Hoshijiro was pointless as a character. All she does was just have a bond with Nagate that I didn\\'t feel attached to.\\nKunato was the character I despised the most because he treated Nagate like crap in episode 7. However, he didn\\'t affect me in the slightest.\\nI wished that some characters have more screen time and back story so that at least they can stand out in my opinion.\\nCONCLUSION (9):\\nApocalyptic anime always highlight tragedies in real life events. One of the example is Sidonia no Kishi. I also wished that some characters have more screen time. In fact, I wanted to know more about how Gauna existed.\\nI also heard that season 2 would be announced. At least season 2 would give enough time to develop the characters.\\nSidonia no Kishi has great morale like surviving in space is never easy because in space, there\\'s no oxygen and low gravity. Gravity can affect people\\'s movement.\\nOverall, this anime is non-stop fun, the soundtrack is amazing, stellar animation, great character development. That\\'s why I give it a 9/10. If you are into sci-fi action, you will love this anime.\\nI will never feel bored after watching this anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5dec2b9ae107bb28afbedb89ced05d88'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Nihei Tsutomu is one of the leading manga authors of the cyberpunk genre. With his amazing artwork in pieces like Biomega and BLAME!, it was obvious he was on a roll by the time he got into creating Sidonia no Kishi. The problem became apparent though, in his most acclaimed piece BLAME!. People had a hard time comprehending the story. Though BLAME! was experimental and had beautiful atmosphere and artwork, the adaptation did not turn out well. This created a stigma with whether or not Nihei’s work could be adapted well. When a new animation studio decided to pick up Nihei’s newest work, Sidonia no\\nKishi, people were interested. The hesitation lay in the medium of animation, CGI. Now the question remains as to whether Sidonia no Kishi would wipe of the stigma brought on by the BLAME! Adaptation, or just follow in its footsteps.\\nKnights of Sidonia is a futuristic cyberpunk piece which is Nihei Tsutomu’s niche. The big change from BLAME! to this piece though, was the story. The story, rather than leaving it more ambiguous, was more straightforward. The human race is forced into space due to a predatory and mysterious enemy called the Gauna. In order to defend the last bastion of the human race, an enormous space ship called Sidonia, the humans make use of giant mechs called Guardes to do battle with the Gauna.  This setting allows for more dramatic turns to take place as humanity scrambles to face off against an enemy they know hardly anything about. The technology is advanced, allowing for interesting views upon population control and reproduction—along with the scientific breakthroughs with a certain energy called, Higg’s Particles. This energy is in fact a real thing, and not out of the realm of possibility. However, proper utilization of it will not be achievable for many years to come. It is evident that a lot of research went into the creation of the way of life on the ship of Sidonia. The Guana alone have a mystique behind them that keeps your interest as you witness them grotesquely evolve during battles. With all this captivating lore aside, there is a lot of explanation which takes time to get through. However, this does not hinder the pacing, which is a really good thing because it allows you enjoy the story along with fleshing out their lifestyle.\\nThe majority of the plot itself is character driven, and the environment takes a backseat to some more trivial problems that help flesh out the main cast. The melding of both the situation at hand and the character’s personal struggles is well played out, with little to no hiccups. Between the intense battling at times though, it seems a little too lax for my taste. Let’s say you are on a mission where you lose twenty five lives in the process and instead of mourning, you go to the beach or a festival. I know it’s to take away the stress of everyday life, but if that is going to be done, I don’t want to have a smaller struggle happen while they are on break. Just little nitpicks on the story. All in all, it has a solid base to segue forward from here into the next season.\\nI’ve already stated that the plot is more character driven than complex, but in order to do this successfully you need to have a dynamic cast. Tsutomu did this beautifully; through each relationship and each battle, the main cast continues to grow and become more realistic. Though making a cast too realistic could cause them to be boring, these characters did not have this trouble. Each character had quirks that allowed you to easily distinguish between them, even with the infinite amount of clones that are pilots. The clones show that despite being genetically similar, their experiences are what shape them into who they are. Though there are a few odd ducks here and there that makes you pause for a second, like the talking bear, all in all the cast meshes together well. The lead character is far from uninteresting, in fact, he is probably the most interesting character (besides one of the possible love interests, Izana). The cast are like everyday people and you can understand the emotions that they experience. This is war, and they are soldiers, not happy-go-lucky high school students, and they act like it.\\nThe music is forgettable at times but is always ambient. It truly meshes into the beautiful atmosphere created by Tsutomu and Polygon Pictures. The song worth mentioning in full is, of course, the opening song. The opening is describing the thought process of those out there fighting the Gauna. They are soldiers, they are not only fighting for themselves, but also so that others may have a future. Even if they die out there, they will have given it their all. It even has a different feel than other openings and sounds like a war chant which pumps up the viewer each time they watch.\\nNow here we get to the sketchy part of the anime, the animation. Now I know Polygon Works is an upcoming studio and this is their first anime, but it actually wasn’t entirely bad as many people say. While at times, it is a detriment when you are trying to figure out who is who with the lighting at times, it also has a decent amount of pros. The grungy textures of the buildings give them a broken down feel, setting the atmosphere for the times. Things sometimes seem more polished, which makes them lose that same appeal. For example, the ship has been in commission for hundreds of years, it shouldn’t be in pristine condition anywhere. The Gauna look demented and terrifying and the action sequences are really well done. For a first time studio, it was pretty good CGI.\\nKnights of Sidonia is my favourite piece from Nihei Tsutomu. Though it is hard getting all the nuances in his drawing into an animated format, they did a great job. The characters were as strong as I remember them from the manga. The gravity of the situation is mediocrely communicated compared to the manga, but the overall atmosphere is very cyberpunk, playing well to its genre. While BLAME! might not have made a great impact, Sidonia no Kishi certainly showed us that there is a capability to adapt Nihei’s masterful artwork and story off of the page.\\nStory: 8.9\\nCharacters: 9.2\\nMusic: 7.8\\nAnimation: 7.5\\nEnjoyment: 8.4\\nOverall: 8.4\\nEdited by: PhantomTigers, imabooterfly', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '78f04e2762722694f269c0acca46c352'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Imagine a world, waking up every day, and realizing that you could be exterminated any moment. In the world of Sidonia no Kishi, that’s a common trend for every single human who are still alive. The primary cause of this are the Gauna, alien extraterrestrials that have devastated humanity into near distinction. As the show takes place in an apocalyptic future, a journey with Sidonia no Kishi will be one of the dark ages.\\nThe brainchild of the series and idea is Tsutomu Nihei, known for his other manga works such as Blame and Biomega. In Sidonia no Kishi, he spawns the idea of sci-fi\\nand packages it with war themes. For instance, humanity is at war against the mysterious Gauna. Their means of survival depends on a generation skip known as the Sidonia. Since Earth have been annihilated, there’s little hope besides working together in unity for survival. We get the very sense of despair with our characters as they live in near hopelessness. One particular character named Nagate Tanikaze stands out as a top ace in the series as result of simulator training from underground. But one day, he comes out from the layers of Sidonia and witness reality.\\nFrom the first opening moments of the show, it’s easy to tell that humanity is in a path of despair. The fact that their previous home planet Earth no longer exists serves a testament for their solitude. But for what’s worth, the show still depicts humanity as a fighting group, resilient and with articulate sense for payback. The show illustrates this with Sidonia being the most prominent ship, perhaps because the others have been gone for over eight centuries. With Sidonia though, the show portrays them as the sole resistance. Calling them knights is probably a better term that fits with the title of the show by translation – Knights of Sidonia. It’s important to realize the show reveals secrets and plot twists relating to Sidonia and the population itself. Startling twists tells stories and controversies gets people talking.\\nReality bites Nagate as he realizes how grim it is. Throughout the show, Nagate is shown as a normal young man despite being isolated. He is selfless, compassionate, caring, courageous, and has tons of potential to become a savior as result of his training with his grandfather’s Guardian simulator. What he possesses though is more than just his raw skills but his instinct and will to fight for what he believe in. He believes in hope and strives to survive with the people he built connections with. And from that, he also puts others’ well-being before himself. One of those characters is Izana Shinatose, a transgender human. Among others he befriends includes Shizuka Hoshijiro and Yuhata Midorikawa, both who shares a relationship with him among all the chaos. It’s from these relationships that expands on Nagate’s character as we get to know him more. The show cleverly balances the atmosphere of despair and humor with their interactions. More so though, we see more of Nagate’s personality as well and can appreciate him more as a person. But as a Guardian Pilot, he also possess a sense of pride. This is clearly seen through his rivalry with Norio Kunato, another top trainee. However, Kunato is a cold man and looks down others for their inferiority. His idealism and ego often defines his character as the complete opposite of Nagate.\\nIt’s clear that the show has its mysteries relating to almost everything whether it’s the Gauna, humanity, or just reality itself. It invites questions with twists, some more startling than others. For example, the captain of the Immortal Ship Committee is seen throughout the show as a mysterious individual with a mask that hides her face and possible intentions. Some of her missions and abilities to command the crew has led to death and sorrow. Other mysteries recalled in the series includes the methods that humanity uses to survive. Science has broken boundaries like never before with concepts such as human cloning, photosynthesis, and asexual reproduction. And throughout the show, these concepts are explored in small yet fine details.\\nDespite the pessimism, the show does have space for some heartwarming moments and even comedic scenarios. The show isn’t designed for comedy but its humorous moments can unintentionally spawn laughter with its gimmicks. The more heartwarming moments include Nagate’s relationship development with certain characters. Unfortunately at the same time, it also raises death flags for certain characters as no one is immortal. For Nagate, he must overcome the struggles of loss and deal with reality. Thankfully, he has friends and they create memories that serves as his motivation to annihilate the Gauna. Some of these friends even develop a seemingly romantic interest towards Nagate, which seems to be depicted as an innocent story. On the other hand, the show also crafts tragedy from such connections with devastating executions completed with aftermath sorrow. Needless to say but it’s a tough world they are part of now if Gauna co-exists with humanity.\\nAs a show of the sci-fi and mecha theme, expect abnormal attributes to be inserted in. For the Gauna, they are epitome of abnormality. They are the executioners of humanity and are designed to as such. But besides their outer appearance, secrets and their fighting methods can raise eyebrows especially after seeing the results of their powers. Meanwhile, we have the way humanity fights back through the usage of Guardian, powerful mechanized weapons of war. It’s explained that Hyggs particles are the power source for these weapons. There are also various typed of these weapons as we see them in action. In fact, Nagate becomes a pilot for one such prototype where he demonstrates why he is an ace pilot. And by presenting itself with both sides with these themes, the show becomes like a professor for science fiction along with the previously mentioned concepts.\\nThe show looks strong overall on paper but does suffer a few bits when it comes to overall execution. Some bits of the story (while adapted well) is still predictable. The comedy and drama sometimes seems forceful and inappropriate, sometimes executed at the wrong moments. Some concepts and ideas of the show also feels static when it comes to originality. The way it adapts itself often sees humanity as the underdog. It becomes sometimes aching to see just how much humanity can take with hopelessness. The Gauna themselves lacks characterization because of their mindless depiction. For all we know, the show only throws hints about their true origins but still leaves its true visage in the dark.\\nThe artwork could be a hit or miss for viewers. Polygon Production studio crafts the unusual structure of the series with CGI. The artwork in fact defines the way Sidonia should be like with its starships, character designs, and Gauna. It would take some hard time to get used to but overall fitting for a post-apocalyptic era. The starships doesn’t just look technological but also innovatively crafted with solid details. Character designs shows most characters with albino features but this is because of the photosynthesis, a concept that is honest to the show. When it comes to horrific, the Gauna species speaks for itself with their design. Their fetus-like structures with tentacle, size, and eldritch behavior all paints the grim image of death; a common theme that is present throughout the show serving as a heart breaker. But overall, the action is fluid with intensity and delivers solid coordination when it comes to its warfare. The various mecha designs shows how advanced technology has come with a high-key consistency.\\nSoundtrack is no pushover either when it comes to delivery. The OP and ED songs aren’t just for show but also illustrates creativity. The eerie-like tones is like an echo for the overall thoughtful concepts. And to get the job done, it also goes to lengths to heighten interest with its OST. Indeed, the background music and soundtrack is vigorous with energy. On the other hand, character voice mannerisms is moderate. There’s nothing too special about any of the character tones. Perhaps the Honoka sisters are worth mentioning since their voice contradicts their age. But that’s not really a big drawback considering its stellar voice mannerisms overall when it comes to duty to action. During climatic and emotional scenes, characters’ voices goes full throttle to demonstrate empowerment and credibility to this show’s reality.\\nNihei transcends his thoughts and formulates them into this show, one that I find to be captivating. The characters are dynamic, the story is thought-provoking, and the overall premise has high class style. As a sci-fi adventure mixed with all sorts of little ideas and concepts, it’s something to take in all at once. But the show cleverly divides and conquers with these ideas as if it’s all planned. The result is a success and thrilling piece of work, one that is memorable not for its deaths and tragedies, but for its fascinating journey with appreciable thoughts.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1c8f67e0bd3023792c0470c323a7844c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Sidonia no Kishi, I heard a lot about this series and how it\\'s similar to Attack on titan. So me as a big fan of attack on titan came in to see what all the hype and talk about this series was about.\\nStory 6/10. The story is about Gauna a alien race that has destroyed the solar system and now humans are on  the brink of extinction and are now forced to live in giant seed ships. Nagate Tanikaze is the main character of this series, he\\'s entrusted to pilot the legendary unit known as Tsugumori. So basically this series is a survival series\\nwith some Gundam themes in it. The only similarity between this series and attack on titan is that humans are on the brink of extinction just like the other thousands of anime that has this theme. But I guess people reference attack on titan since it\\'s a very popular series and that\\'s a easier way to make more people become a ware of this series by mentioning its similarities between them.\\nArt 6.5/10. At first I was very turn off by the art, but I gradually got use to it and it wasn\\'t as bad as I initially thought. The cgi looks good when it comes to space battles. I\\'m still not a big fan of using cgi in anime period, but this wasn\\'t too bad imo.\\nSound 8/10. Now the sound this was one of the things I like in the series, the soundtracks are really good and memorable and it made the fight scenes even more intense.\\nCharacters 5/10. Now for me the characters were very flat and bland, so when a character died I didn\\'t care at all, the main characters and most of the supporting characters are cut out cardboard boxes, the cgi also made the characters have a robotic like movement which made the characters look even more bland, \"beep beep I am a robot\" What\\'s worst is that everyone looks identical and I know that it\\'s because of the cloning machine, but that still doesn\\'t change the fact that I mix up characters sometimes because they all have similar facial expression, the only thing that makes everyone looks different is the hair style/colour of hair, and I\\'m talking both male and female it doesn\\'t matter give the main character a female hairy style and he will look like a girl.\\nEnjoyment 7/10. With all the negatives, I still enjoyed this series a lot and it was really good, I enjoyed the action and the harem romance as well. ;)\\nOverall 7/10. Overall it was the good soundtrack and enjoyment is what made this series a 7/10 for me. This series doesn\\'t bring anything new to the table, but the series did a fairly good job in what it was aiming at, and that\\'s to be a good survival series. So my final thoughts give this series a shot even if you don\\'t like the cgi still give a shot, the cgi isn\\'t as bad as you will initially thought.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'High-concept sci-fi is hardly a rarity in anime, in fact it is integral to the medium as a whole. Apocalyptic struggles for the survival of humanity are also quite common, and giant robots are synonymous with anime. However, as well tread as these elements are, they can still feel fresh and like they’re on the cutting-edge when done correctly. Knights of Sidonia, adapted from a manga by acclaimed author Tatsomu Nihei of the same title, is a prime example for this. If taken on their own, the plot elements that the show uses are not breaking any new ground, and yet they come together to\\ncreate an exciting sci-fi actioner that is distinctive despite all the familiarities it shares with other shows of its genre.\\nA large part of what makes Knights of Sidonia so distinct is the thoughtful and well realized sci-fi world that Nihei has created. It is a world rife with super-science, enveloped in deeply intriguing mystery, and haunted by monstrous abominations. There are tons of fascinating concepts which are interwoven together to make a well detailed and convincing post-apocalyptic universe in which the last of humanity is forced to live on a space colony, and must defend itself against inhuman beings called the Gauna.  Grand scale tragedies and dire circumstances have forced significant change onto mankind; both social and biological. Humans have been genetically modified to photosynthesize after a food shortage crisis. People wear belts that latch onto designated safety ramps in case of gravity instability. Some humans are born gender neutral, only becoming male or female after finding a mate. Mankind lives in a constant state of war, essentially under military rule.  Anti-war protesters claim that if mankind lays down its weapons, the Gauna will leave it be. Every concept adds a little more detail which makes the world all the more believable, and very little feels extraneous or unnecessary. That said, the world is so expansive in detail that there are many things which are left vague or unexplained, but since the show’s 12 episodes only covers a small portion of the on-going manga’s material, these will presumably be elaborated on in later instalments.\\nThe story itself follows Nagate Tanikaze, a human who has lived most of his life in the underground tunnels of Sidonia and has not been genetically modified to photosynthesis, but none the less is a talented pilot. After arriving on the surface, Nagate joins Sidonia’s military force as he learns more about Sidonia and its society. In a way, Nagate acts as an audience surrogate, as much of what we learn about Sidonia is revealed through his experiences. His relationships with his fellow pilots and other citizens of Sidonia is also at the emotional core of the show. His instant friendship with gender-neutral Izana, attraction to fellow pilot Shizuka Hoshijiro, the one-sided grudge Norio Kunato holds against him, all of these give the show a human aspect that keeps the show from being as cold and concept driven as it could have been. This is especially true when the plot takes some tragic turns that put Nagate through the emotional wringer. Nagate himself might not stand out as wholly unique when compared to other protagonists in the mecha genre, the talented misfit pilot is a well-worn trope, but he is a likeable lead that is easy cheer for, and human enough to relate.\\nThe rest of the cast is, more or less, equally well developed. Izana in particular is a very likeable character, though admittedly is suspiciously feminine for a character that is supposed to be gender-neutral. Her relationship with Nagate is refreshing and highly endearing, and her developing crush on him is frankly adorable. Shizuka is just as endearing, being a sweet and unimposing love-interest for our protagonist. Kunato is decidedly a self-righteous jerk (putting it lightly considering the consequences of his actions), but has enough of a human-edge to make him understandable in his disdain for our protagonist, though by no means justified. Though not explored very deeply, the Gauna are an appropriately intimidating and mysterious menace that mankind rightfully fears. Even many of the bit players get just enough personality to get attached, though in some cases it is pretty apparent that they are there to be fodder for the body count.\\nThe plot moves at a brisk pace, not wasting much time, if any at all. Veteran screenwriter Sadayuki Murai and the rest of the writing team must be commended on adapting Nihei’s expansive sci-fi world to the screen without relying too heavily on information dumping, while giving ample time for relationships to develop and having a substantial amount of action. Admittedly all is not perfect, with some plot points being overly obtuse, and some of the character interactions and dialogue can feel kind of phoned in. There are times when the show feels too close to being a harem, with so many of the girls taking an interest in Nagate, which does feel pretty unnecessary and a bit like a power-fantasy. However, as a whole, the writing here is rather impressive stuff.\\nOn a technical standpoint, Knights of Sidonia looks pretty good, but certainly has its rough spots. Most of the technical shortcomings come from the show’s use of CG models, usually for the battles, but sometimes for character animation as well. By no means is the CG work here bad, in fact it is rather good for a series. However, it does have its bouts of awkwardness from time to time, and they are rather noticeable. By in large, the CG mecha battles fair better than when the CG is used for character animation. Granted, the former has moments of awkwardness, but at its worst the latter can be emersion breaking. That said, Kōbun Shizuno’s direction compensates for most of the show’s technical deficiencies. He knows how to frame a shot, and can choreograph action extremely well. All of the show’s action sequences and other set-pieces are executed cleanly and in spectacular fashion; never getting too busy or muddled. It also has a small amount of fan-service added in, albeit slyly using the concept of photosynthesis, but it is telling that we never see any of the men stripping naked to photosynthesis. The music by Noriyuki Asakura is fitting for a space sci-fi and used well to support the show’s content, though the battle music will likely be what you will remember the most.\\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia is an expertly made sci-fi mecha action show. It does have a fair amount of shortcomings, most notably the sometime awkward CG animation and the rather needless harem element. Nor does the show really break any knew ground, for as polished and well thought out as it is. However, the show has a surplus of positives that compensate for its flaws. The sci-fi setting is rich and well detailed. The characters are interesting and likeable, for the most part. The plot is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, and the action is exhilarating. It might not be the absolute best of the mecha genre, but it is certainly an impressive addition.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6b61a524f4babaaa8751ed04bdaaad71'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Knights of Sidonia is a science fiction action series adapted from renowned mangaka Nihei Tsutomu. The series - which is arguably more accessible than the authors other work - has received a favourable adaptation from Polygon Pictures, though unfortunately certain elements fail to avoid banality.\\nThe narrative is an enthralling romp through outer space and Sidonia - the series' giant intergalactic city, complete with Tsutomu's famously captivating architecture - though at certain points it loses its way (or rather, its appeal) as it devolves into a generic harem. This element could have been better portrayed - perhaps displaying the characters' desperation in trying to find love\\nduring their limited lifespan in such a dangerous time - but instead takes a more comedic route, which does well to balance the series and prevent it from becoming a lifeless action set piece, and is also a more light-hearted way to explore and develop the cast, but unfortunately it does little to challenge convention. It’s not as big an issue as it could have been, as the plot is often redeemed through its pace and sci-fi focus, not to mention some twists, which keep the plot fairly engaging, but overall it suffers at times from rather formulaic writing.\\nThe characters are relatively conventional, with each displaying little more than a single trait. These familiar archetypes don't necessarily ruin the series, but their motivation and back-stories become - at times - rather predictable. Like the harem elements, it would have been nice to see more originality, though certain plot twists do sometimes steer the characters away from their moulds. The main character - Tanizake - is at times stupidly aloof, but the cast are an interesting ensemble, despite cliches.\\nThe animation and art is vastly computer generated, the style of which has been fully embraced by the anime staff. Unlike the lapses in originality in the plot and characters, the art style is incredibly fresh and surprisingly befitting of Tsutomu's work. Certain scenes are a little choppy, but the animation staff have brought Sidonia to life and animate some wonderful scenery, along with extremely compelling, hyper-fast action sequences, with good use of slow motion here and there. The cinematography could have been better executed, however; the setting offers many opportunities for some wonderful, breathtaking shots, which are unfortunately overlooked most of the time. There are also a couple of repeated shots and the unfortunate inclusion of some lewd, questionably framed fan-service snaps, which are completely unnecessary. Overall, however, the animation and art is admirable and a welcomed change to the norm.\\nThe sound is an absolute stand-out element. Sound design and editing isn't often incredibly notable in anime, with feature-length productions often displaying the best in the business, but it's nailed to a tee in Knights of Sidonia. A high quality sound system or headphones are recommended; the sound team create some thoroughly immersive, cinematic work, with the sounds of the monstrous Gauna and the impressive mechs being of particular note - brilliantly produced and edited. The music, too, is very immersive and blends extremely well with the visuals and tone of the series. The sound and music are exceptional; entirely worthy of praise.\\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia has remarkable style, but flawed substance. It’s an enjoyable series with great potential, but a formulaic tale with a narrative and characters seen all too often. Nevertheless, it’s entirely worth watching, with the art style and sound production being huge redeeming qualities. If you can overlook the conventional aspects, you may well hold out for the second series, which - here’s hoping - brings the substance in line with the style.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b1bb05ac2a6e77073b4530aad04c6e37'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'This review may contain minor spoilers.\\nKnight of Sidonia is a raw diamond of the recent anime seasons. General fan could be easily dispelled away by the show\\'s odd art style and initial confusing story (at least in my case). However, once you get past the use of 3-D drawing and the lack of narrative, Knight of Sidonia (for short KoS) will amaze any patient audience with its frank manner of storytelling and brilliant space atmosphere.\\nWhat set KoS apart from other space/mecha  anime series is that it is not giving a damn in pleasing fan with flashy battles, human living in beautiful spaceships or\\n\"escaping\" stories that one can insert himself into. KoS tells its unique story and stays honest to the terror of space with tons of deaths, brutal horrors, and human ugliness when forced to survive in a confine place.\\nStory 10/10:\\nIt\\'s the same struggles of humanity against alien race in space. What make KoS outstanding is that it is a shine example of a show-not-tell story. Rather than having a narrative explaining all the underlying problems, audience are forced to learned the story bit by bit in conversations, character actions and background environments throughout the 12 chapters. For instance, audiences in one chapter may notice production scarcity by human adaptation to photosynthesis, and population crisis through the introduction of a third gender in the next. Along with lots of unexpected deaths and dark twists, KoS is bound to keep the story fresh and captivating.\\nArt 6/10:\\nIf familiar with well-known and eye-candy space shows such as Space Ship Yamato or Macross Frontier, audiences may have difficulty adapting to the 3-D and \"bland\" colors of KoS. I personally find the 3-D character designs somewhat dull and lifeless. The background colors sometimes disjoint and seem like a mess. On a positive side, the series portrays extreme details in its mecha, weapons, human community and especially the vastness of space. In KoS, space ships and even the monstrous alien races are minor to the endless darkness of the universe. The 3-D drawing also effectively made the light of the stars seem much real and distant, rather than some simple white dots in a black background.\\nSound 9/10:\\nThe thumping machine sound of the big space ship engines, the grand fanfare when all the mechas joined together in a rescue mission and the soft music while some characters enjoy a romantic moment could give a chill to any fan. While I do not find the OP/ED particularly special, the care KoS took in its background sound is significant. Personally, these background sounds gave me a sense of a \"big, cold and quiet\" space.\\nCharacter 8/10:\\nKoS characters cast is very distinguish from other space shows in that they are generally mentally strong and willing to accept the cruel fate of space. When their comrades die, some completely break down, some lament quietly and keeps moving on with determination. There will not be a scene of bumping fist in a wall or long remember speech to induce cheap sympathy. While there are some generic archetypes, most characters are memorable with their own sense of pride and belief.\\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\nI immensely enjoy Knight of Sidonia.  Its show-not-tell technique treated me like a smart audience, forced me to think. Its realistic space concept, for example, what moving keep moving in space, made other shows childish. KoS does not comfort when we learn some inconvenience truth about human struggles. Though there are some mesmerizing peaceful scenes, death remains death, space cruelty remains as horrify as it can be. And by staying true to itself, KoS has respected me.\\nOverall 9/10\\nWith the recent anime seasons, some shows start out strong with beautiful animation and promising plots. Somewhere along the line, they compromised their stories for a comfort twist, avoiding conflict for the sake of entertaining a wider range of audiences. Thankfully, Knight of Sidonia does not resort itself to these means.\\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a mature, dark, and realistic space series, Knight of Sidonia is a must choice. The characters inner struggles are great, the background sound will give you goose bumps, and most importantly it tells you an unforgettable tale. I sincerely hope anime fans or general movie watchers could give this show the success it needs for a second season.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1fa943820b490615e7c47cff95d7d284'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Imagine a Sci-fi epic with the tenacity of becoming something of a psychological journey into the deep unknown. Many movies have captured the feelings of being out in the far reaches of interstellar travel in space rockets, or in this case, giant mechas. With the help of talented writers, that dream can become real, in order to prove to the viewers that it can retain that sci-fi glory and be significant to the genre. All it takes is something like Sidonia no Kishi to show that the genre is far from dead.\\nWhat sets Sidonia no Kishi at the top spot along with many great space\\nepics in anime is how beautifully crafted it sets up the premise. Rich, with a well-developed lore that organizes the tension that we feel with the dilemma that the characters are facing. It’s clear from how the writers put all of their effort into crafting a great narrative to capsulize the drama to make us root for the characters, rather than apathetically rooting for their deaths. This includes genuine tragic emotion and a heart pounding climax that puts it on overdrive to appease the action fans. Even with its shallow ending that feels rather abrupt, that is only a minor issue to a story that has more things going for it on a larger scale.\\nNot only does Sidonia no Kishi nail it on the narrative aspect of story, but it enriches itself with a very deeply layered lore that feels relatively fresh. Sure, humans who are near extinction going out to settle in open space may not be “new” in the strictest sense. However, Sidonia no Kishi offers a slightly different approach to this setting. Rather than make a narrative that’s over encompassing with large factions and political strife, it’s more personal and first-person, following our hero Nagate. Through this approach, we have a relatively intimate experience with the characters and the story that helps navigate towards their dialogue and interactions with the world and other people. It’s here where the show sets a nice bar pretty high for a genre that hasn’t delved into this type of narrative, and doing it well no less.\\nWhat it has to amount to is how the characters portray themselves in the narrative to have a huge impact. Unfortunately, only a few of them standout as accomplishing this. The few that do are the main protagonists, Nagate and Izana. This is the fact of how they have a nicely written bond towards the halfway point into the plot, but also how they develop overtime, whether it’s their relationship or their own individual roles. Nagate is portrayed as dealing with the turbulent lifestyle of Sidonia’s poorer sub-culture and his growth is developed gradually and with intelligence. Meanwhile Izana starts out as a plain-old character that will be the obvious love interest, but they actually take a few risks in being written as a guide for Nagate. She isn’t just a love interest and nothing else, she has a hand in the development of Nagate and doesn’t appear as useless to the show.\\nSo what is wrong with the rest of the cast? Nothing entirely major, it just all comes down to how much of an impact they have in their individual presence, which only range from decent to below average. The obvious choice for decent is Hoshijiro and how the writers treat her tragic role. All that comes down to for the rest aren’t that they are uninteresting, but all I can see in most of their archetypes are Characters A, B, C and nothing else. They don’t issue more of a response other than just look at them as tools to forward the plot. However, once the tragedy settles in either character, it still gets a reaction, but that’s only because of how well the atmosphere is created.\\nWhere things get a little heated is the animation, particularly the CG-ness of Sidonia no Kishi. Following on the footsteps of the glorious CG shlock called, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, it decides to implement its animation into the CG format that had a divided reception in recent iterations of anime. However, unlike Ars Nova, the CG is actually well-made in this instance simply by the fact that the movements, for the most part, feel very fluid and smooth. Because this is set in a mecha environment, it does feel more appropriate implementing CG into the mix so that the artist can do more with what they are given. I wouldn’t go far as to say it’s groundbreaking, but it’s as close to greatness as one could get from it.\\nSince this is a mecha after all, it would be fair to critique the action sequences, since that’s what most fans of the genre look forward to. For someone like me who hasn’t delved into the genre as much as the next person, I found myself actually on edge throughout most of these sequences. This is thanks in no part to the animation and sound department and how intense they make the scenes, which are so kinetic and focused on what is going on. The final battle sequence alone garners needed praise to how greatly directed it portrays it with tight coordination and timing with how the characters try to overcome this dire dilemma. So if you have been waiting for an anime that is akin to past Gundam action sequences, this blows most of them out of the park.\\nOverall, we don’t get nearly enough anime that tries to attempt being basing around an intelligent story woven enough to where it’s actually coherent, while also being entertaining to watch at the same time. While I won’t consider this an instant sci-fi classic that many will appreciate for generations, it does have the hallmarks of leading some to treasure it. The two main leads definitely own their roles and are worth the watch for them alone. What will come of how they will continue this great trend and respect the source material, only time will tell. Either way, I’m happy to wait for that inevitable continuation.\\nGrade: A-', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8916f27a07177b2afd67601dfe954b01'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Ok, I don't write many reviews, but considering how bad this anime was I feel it can't be that hard.\\nThis was probably spelled out in the plot synopsis, but Knights of Sidonia (or シドニアの騎士) is a science fiction, mecha action anime where humans have fled Earth a thousand years ago on a giant space ship called 'Sidonia' fleeing from the threat of unknown origin known as the 'Gauna'. Protagonist Nagate Tanikaze in search for food stumbles out of the vast inner workings of Sidonia and out into the open society where he is selected to be a Guardian Pilot defending Sidonia against the Gauna\\nthreat.\\nI've never been a fan of CGI in anime since it definitely isn't Japan's strong suit (though I commend them for trying something new) and they'd be better off just sticking to what they already do best and focus on other aspects of storytelling. So I came into this anime with a hesitant mindset, but I soon got entranced really quickly when the first space battle happened. The 'gauna' are awesome in my opinion. They can take many different forms and can evolve to increase their efficiency at countering human technology. On top of that, they are horrifying. Not the most scary thing I've seen, but I wouldn't want to tango with any of those.\\nAlthough, I think what captured me most about the beginning of this show was space; everything space. I love space, and anything that takes place in space is sure to capture my attention. Also, I was impressed how the concept of space wasn't just a setting, but was also a factor in the story and the battles. And the life on the titular space ship 'Sidonia' was well thought out as well with interesting differences in society affected by advanced technology such as human photosynthesis that allows a independence of food and water for a week. The main character didn't grow up in the society of Sidonia and as a result he can't photosynthesize. I liked this distinction in his character. And herein lies the first problem: that's the only thing I like about this character.\\nSo for the first episode, Knights of Sidonia is going in a pretty good direction in my opinion. And honestly, this had me tricked for the next few episodes. It took me awhile before I realized it steadily got worse. It started when I realized that this anime is almost the exact same plot as Attack on Titan (進撃の巨人). First off, a main character that doesn't know his origins joins the military when the enemy reappears after a hundred years without a sighting. The main protagonist quickly becomes the spearhead of the military when he is discovered to be a special asset that could almost single handedly win the war; a war in which humanity has been waging as long as they can remember and threatens the very existence of humankind. A war with an enemy that is bent on the complete eradication of humans without determinable rhyme or reason. Humans built a special base to defend and counteract against the enemy that is led by questionable leaders that could prove just as much a threat as the outside enemy.\\nThe baseline of this story is extremely similar to Attack on Titan with different setting, characters, and plot twists (very poor and predictable plot twists I might add).\\nSo I started comparing the two, and I began seeing very clear distinctions in what Knights of Sidonia was lacking. As I said before, I despise the protagonist. Not just because he is awkward, annoying, bland, and holds no true character flaws besides being socially inapt, but mainly because I have no idea why he is fighting the gauna so passionately. In Attack on Titan, Eren held a very powerful grudge against the Titans because of his past experiences with them.This is what allowed us to sympathize and connect with Eren as a character. Nagate has absolutely no past experiences with the gauna and suddenly because somebody just simply asked him to become the 'Knight of Sidonia' or some prophetic hero destined to save Sidonia he becomes determined to eliminate all of the gauna and dedicate his life to protecting the society and people that he 'loves'. When you read it, that would at least make a little sense, but keep in mind that he decided this after being in this society for only a few days! How can he claim to love something he hardly as any knowledge of? Worst of all, whenever he is not fighting gauna or speaking with Sidonia's commander, he seems to completely forget all that. The motivation that is meant to drive him as a character hardly affects him at all, and I end up forgetting what his role is in the story. And I'm going to go so far as to say that I forget what the story even is about anymore whenever their not fighting gauna.\\nThis show doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be an awesome scifi, or if it wants to be a mediocre harem. Honestly, the harem aspect takes 75 percent of the screen time, and almost all of it is completely useless. There was only one time when the harem part of the story affected the actual plot. I attribute this to a misunderstanding of (or just pure apathy to) the concept of character development. Knights of Sidonia seems to interpret that as 'sexual tension' and 'love drama'. To make it worse, sometimes this sexual tension/love drama is so poorly written and cheesy that I started to think I was watching a porno. Dialogue is bad, characters are one dimensional and unappealing, and its just overall disappointing to see this interesting society getting plague by these cardboard cutouts of overused character archetypes. The protagonist is terrible, the female characters are worse because they are head over heels for this guy for absolutely no other reason than a 'because I said so' attitude by the author, and this other male character who seemed to be important had promise since he was the protagonist's opposite and was willing to make morally ambiguous decisions to get his way; however, when he started to see some of the effects of his decisions, he quickly became a wimp, quit being a pilot, and was kicked out of the story never to be relevant again. Honestly, the best character in this show is the Benisusume, whose identity is a spoiler so I won't reveal anymore than that except that this character has only about four lines that are almost exactly the same. And the worse part of this is the portrayal of women. I know that the anime industry usually targets adolescent boys who can't focus on anything that doesn't have breast the size of jupiter, but this is ridiculous. Also, this show can't possibly be intended for young boys, because it clearly attempts to make itself dark and gritty like Tokyo Ghoul or Attack on Titan but can never stick to that tone. So I don't know what audience the author is writing to and what he is trying to say with his story. It sounded like mindless babbling to me.\\nI don't talk too much on the story in comparison to the characters, but that is because the story was interesting and held promise; though, it was quickly overshadowed by every other terrible thing that it completely lost its appeal. I watched this show to the end in hopes of rekindling that promise and maybe the story would once again have the majority of the screen time, and I was given at least a fraction of reward with a season finale in both seasons that were done fairly well and proved that if this author had simply stuck to what he does best instead of this harem garbage this could have been a good thing.\\nNot to say that I don't think harems can be good. I have watched a lot of harems and enjoyed a few. I'm just saying this is a very bad one.\\nSince sound is an area of critique on this site, I'll mention a little something about that. There isn't much that stands out about the soundtrack and nothing leaves an impression except for the opening credits. I imagine that these openings were meant to be exciting and with a hint of patriotic-like pride just as the Attack on Titan openings were. However, these fail terribly at replicating this. The animation for the opening is literally shots from the rest of the show dreadfully edited together with a very underwhelming song choice that lacks energy, emotion, and impact.\\nOverall, I didn't enjoy Knights of Sidonia despite the very interesting concept behind it simply because it didn't allow me to enjoy it by shoving other things I don't care about in my face and trying to get me to accept them. This show really has an identity crisis, trying to wear the clothes of a harem comedy while also trying to be a gritty, realistic scifi. If a harem comedy anime wants me to take it seriously and realistically, then it either needs to not be a harem comedy or try harder; a lot harder.\\nIn conclusion, don't watch this show. It is horrible, and it is the definition of what is wrong with the anime industry that can't seem to let go of its horrendous cliches and characters archetypes. When will they start trusting us to be interested in a story that doesn't have kinky sexual comedy and breasts the size of jupiter?\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '46ef9cf9c75698804f85e2296dcef385'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Knights of Sidonia is an anime that pushes a hard sci-fi storyline mixed with elements of \"real robot\" mecha in exploring the Sidonia fleet\\'s struggles against a mysterious alien threat in space that has nearly driven humanity to the brink of extinction. The major element of Sidonia that sticks out prominently is the meticulous detail it provides to showing off the world of the Sidonia space colony. The series devotes a great amount of effort in detailing varying elements to the civilization of the series as humans aboard Sidonia have undergone genetic engineering that provide them with differing abilities to adapt to the space colony\\nenvironment they live in that include utilizing cloning to increase population size and giving humans the ability to perform photosynthesis to reserve on food supplies. This meticulous detail also went into the mecha and technologies of the series as limitations of their capabilities, the zero gravity of space, potential for casualties and ammo/ energy reserves are factored into missions and battle tactics seen throughout the series a la past \"real robot\" titles like Gasaraki and Patlabor.\\nThe other prominent element to Sidonia that sticks out is its high quality visuals. Milking use of 3DCG animation, the use of the technology helps to give more realistic detail to its character and scenery designs with subdued color tones to compliment the title\\'s serious storytelling. Movement is very fluid throughout the series, best highlighted in showing off the realistic effects that gravity has on the human pilots and the intense action scenes that take place between the Sidonia mecha and the alien threat they are dealing with. The only setbacks with the use of 3DCG with Sidonia are that its use give character designs a somewhat plastic feel that can be rather noticeable in some camera angles and facial designs are poorly animated with limited range of expression.\\nWhen it comes to the story and characters of Knights of Sidonia as a whole, the series is a bit on the generic side in these areas. Sidonia mostly relies on story elements and character archetypes typical of sci-fi titles to carry along the series and it doesn\\'t really offer anything new for the genre that I might have already seen before. The gifted teenage pilot and uptight, jealous rival seen in the form of Nagate and Norio\\'s chemistry has been a recurring character dynamic of past titles and this dynamic is rather shallow since both characters don\\'t get much in the way of dimension or depth. This issue also applies to the majority of other characters seen throughout the series as they mostly exist to fill specific tropes found in sci-fi anime, from the doomed love interest (which the Gundam franchise milked enough for many of its titles) to the secret group of superiors having ulterior motives hidden from the majority of those within their ranks. The whole \"post-apocalyptic future where humanity struggles against an alien threat\" premise is also nothing new and Sidonia offers nothing new to let it stick out from other titles milking similar plots.\\nThere were also some noticeable issues I took notice of with the anime\\'s plotting. Due to the limited depth given to much of the cast, the character deaths seen lack any impact and Sidonia makes a half-assed attempt to force viewers into caring for them by having characters aboard the Sidonia bond with Nagate on the episode they die in. One particular incident that happens during the middle of the series is a bit dumbfounding in how the perpetrator behind it can get off scot-free without any repercussions nor suspicion of it thoroughly investigated by the military, leading to a pointless case where Nagate is reduced to a depressed state and lashed out against by the Sidonia populace. I also have to wonder where in a series that is as meticulously realistic with its sci-fi depiction as Sidonia is, why it has a talking bear with a robotic arm in the form of Lala Hiyama as there is nothing revealed over why she appears as she is while everyone else aboard the Sidonia is human in appearance. In addition, the series ends inconclusively as there are lingering mysteries unresolved with several plot elements within Sidonia.\\nWhile Sidonia is pleasing enough with its animation and implementation of realistic elements for its sci-fi, the series doesn\\'t offer much new to the sci-fi and mecha genres that have been seen from similar titles of its ilk, which made it hard for me to care much for the story and characters it had to offer up. Action and sci-fi fans may enjoy this if they overlook this problem. But Sidonia had me feeling like I seen the stuff it offered up too many times at this point in my 13 years of anime fandom.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e574aaf00c56188ce23646755d3a27b'}>,\n",

When there’s something at stake. When there’s tension. When the main characters could actually lose and fuck up.\\nThis is my biggest issue with the superhero genre. You know Superman or Wolverine are never going to lose. If they die they’ll just come back because nobody stays dead in comics. Your toast getting burnt is more inconvenient.\\nWhen you know your heroes will win or won’t die then any excitement is gone. What’s the point of watching? It can still be entertaining, but it would be\\nmuch, much better if there was tension.\\nThis is what I liked about Knights of Sidonia. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt excitement and fear whenever the characters fought the enemy. The aliens are very strong. The characters’ mecha suits don’t do shit. To kill the aliens you need to use a very specific weapon and to hit them in a very specific body part.\\nEvery time they went out to battle there would be casualties. Someone always died. It could’ve been a minor characters or some cannon fodder, but someone died.\\nPlus, the sci-fi setting is interesting, and I’m a sucker for interesting worlds.\\nWhat’s stopping me from giving this a fresh, fucking 9 is that the characters aren’t that engaging. It’s ironic considering how much tension the show can build.\\nThe main character is boring. He’s never excited or ask questions for us to learn about the world.

It \\'been long since i watched something with such enjoyment.\\nI often rate some good animes 8-9 ball, but 10 i give almost never.

And one of the finest pieces of action/adventure anime at all(much better than, e.g., overrated by dumb kids \"Attack on Titan\").\\nLet me explain why at every point:\\n1)Atmospherous  music,  not only the exatly compositions, but the timing and appropirateness of sound to very each moment is perfect.\\n2)No cryings, stupid emotions for half the episode in \"IWILLKILLYOUEVILLLLAAAAAA\" style, and also no reflections\\nfor half of episode.\\n3)Main charecter. He is not slow, stupid, pervert or something. His emotions are a bit typical for these genre main characters, but, again - there is no annoying roraring, crying, childy enragements and so on for half of each episode, no things that ruined many other good animes.\\n4)The story is being told very softly - typically in animes of same genere, its like - deep \"coolstories\" told in the beginning, then, in middle of series:-\"To hell the lore, lets enjoy how wide protagonist can open his mouth!\".

       "  <Document: {'content': '“Attack on Titan in space?  Well…. not quite.”\\nI was terribly hesitant to delve into another dystopian anime with mechs, as I feel it can be one of the most overused plot elements in any anime, but at the strong recommendation of a friend I tuned into Sidonia no Kishi (Knights of Sidonia).  What I found was a CGI-infused space epic of sorts, which I even later found out to be compared often to Attack on Titan.  It’s a show I wanted to like, but turned out to bland in a lot of ways, hindering its overall successes.\\nKnights of Sidonia takes\\nplace years after unidentified creatures known as “Gauna” invaded Earth, forcing the population to seek refuge elsewhere in space aboard Sidonia, a massive, self-supporting deep space vessel.  Tanikaze, the MC in this series appears to have been living in the depths of Sidonia his entire life, practicing blowing Gauna away in a spacefighting simulator created by his Grandpa.  His grandpa passes away and is left to venture out into the real world for the first time.  Honestly, he ends up adjusting to never interacting with other humans before quite well.  For initially unknown reasons, the captain of the Sidonia military takes a liking to Tanikaze and puts him into pilot training.  There also seems to be an instant harem element present, as the academy’s vice president and other random girls blush at every glance from Tanikaze… of course they would.\\nThe biggest gripe I have with the story in Knights of Sidonia is the actual lack of plot depth.  You see battle after battle with lots of pilots dying, but no one seems to know anything about the Gauna or where they came from.  You would think that after several centuries of fighting with these things… that SOMETHING would’ve been uncovered, just a little clue.  Also, we come to find that there is an immortal council devised of Sidonia residents who seek immortality and provide general guidance to their figurehead, who just so happens to be the military captain.  The only problem is, their formation is alluded to but never fully explained.  And, to make it better… there’s also a chick that is a bear for some reason.  In a ship full of humans, just one bear…. with a robotic hand.  Nice.  You think at one point Tanikaze would ask… “Hey Lala, why is it that you’re a bear?”  Nope, of course it’s normal.\\nTanikaze literally seems like the only intelligent pilot in existence.  Despite the amazing amount of preparation that the other members of the military had to fight against the Gauna, their best four pilots get wiped out almost instantly in their first battle.  Seems legit.  To top it off, by the third battle or so the mediocre pilots are slaying ten to twenty of the Gauna at a time.  All the battles seem to play out the same way as well, which makes the detailed and flashy battle scenes less impressive.  Don’t worry though, Tanikaze will end up pulling through in the end! The story isn’t all bad though, the relationship between Tanikaze and Hoshijiro blossoms well, and the outlook of the dystopian society is well written… just not enough to make up for the blandness.  I also didn’t notice a large amount of similarities between AoT and KoS, except for the low amount of people remaining from Earth and some unexplained entity that they’re fighting to survive against.  I feel that archetype is presented in other animes as well.\\nAn even weaker part of Knights of Sidonia is the characters and the writing of dialogue.  Tanikaze is the stereotypical haremy badass of a protagonist, but his inner emotions and history are never really expounded upon at all.  It would help me relate to the character more if these areas were explained… at least a little bit.  Due to the heavy CGI used in the animation style, it can also be tasking and difficult to decipher proper body language of the characters themselves.  If it weren’t for the random blushing redness on their faces, a comment could honestly be taken way out of context.  The character’s movements made me slightly nostalgic to older shows like Reboot on Toonami, as they seemed to all move similarly.  If you listen closely you can hear their bleeps and bloops.\\nThe rest of the characters are so boring that when they die, I feel apathetic to the whole thing.  If that’s the effect they were going for, they hit the nail on the head.  I did feel Kunato got some development as the series went on, and I actually kind of felt bad for him from the stress consuming him from being a pilot and throwing Tanikaze under the bus regarding Hoshijiro.  It’s a spark of some development but not much.\\nSome people say the CGI makes or breaks viewer’s experience with KoS, but I’m not quite onboard with that mentality.  Sure, it is rather hard to watch at first, because it is different.  And yes, it does detract from the static conversations between characters, but the action scenes are actually beautiful and well constructed.  And they’re plentiful in the anime, which made me actually anticipate what would come next.  The sound is also pretty good.  The opening theme does remind me of Attack on Titan with its fanfare, and the sound effects of the Gardes are cool to say the least.  The OST in general never lacked, and the dramatic openings of battles were orchestrated very well.  Voice acting is alright, but nothing noteworthy.  I had a hard time differentiating between some of the female cast.\\nAside from the plot holes and unoriginal or bland characters, I did enjoy KoS.  It was nonstop action which allowed me to watch almost the entire series in one sitting.  The special effects were great, and I am a sucker for space mechs with oversized guns.\\nKnights of Sidonia could’ve been improved in several ways, and I think the CGI art style may have been a bit too ambitious for the writers to counterbalance with the plot and characters.  Although I enjoyed it, I don’t think it would be for everyone.  If you have some time to kill, and you’re looking for a lot of fast paced action, this one is for you.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'It\\'s quite a weird story how I came to watch this series. One day I was browsing anime series as to what to watch, and \"Knights of Sidonia\" caught my eye. Something immediately clicked in my mind. I just knew I\\'ve seen this somewhere a long time ago, but the description of the anime didn\\'t jog anything, besides, it was a brand new series and I remembered seeing this title many years ago. It was bugging me to no end, but I just couldn\\'t remember. So, on a whim, I decided to watch Knights of Sidonia, in hopes to uncover the mystery. All I can\\nsay, this is nothing I expected...\\nBasically, Knights of Sidonia is a quite average mecha anime with some pretty interesting ideas in art and direction. First of all, the story is blatantly bland and doesn\\'t even worth discussing. It\\'s your standard mecha action-schlock: Armageddon du jour threatens humanity with total destruction, humans fights back with huge mechas. Take unassuming \"Bland Hero No#12628\" who rises from nowhere with an uncanny ability to control said mechas better than even seasoned veterans, rising from zero to hero in an instant, pissing off the enemy, making other male pilots jealous and making all the girls wet their panties with joy. Then force in a totally out of place \"highschool love triangle\" romance subplot, throw in a handful of typecast side characters as plot devices, season with tragic backstory and shady government conspiracy, and finally marinate the whole thing in fast-paced shooty-explodey action scenes. Viola, Knights of Sidonia. It\\'s not bad, but it\\'s nothing revolutionary either, it serves it\\'s purpose as far as story goes, nothing more, nothing less.\\nWhere it gets interesting, is the art direction and the animation itself. For better or for worse, aside from a few parts, the whole thing is made using cell-shaded 3D CGI animation. Because of this, the whole art style uses really thin lines, incredibly bleached/desaturated color palette and significantly higher framerate, which can be pretty jarring against the hand-drawn backdrops sometimes. Also, it doesn\\'t lend itself very well to individual characters, especially facial animations. All the characters, including the protagonist, look completely unremarkable and borderline devoid of emotions. When they do try to force emotions on the characters, it slides into Uncanny Valley territory pretty fast. Not to mention the (thankfully) few goofy/over-the-top fan service and comic relief scenes, where it comes off as downright jarring.\\nCriticism aside, the same CGI makes it possible to present some pretty detailed, jaw-dropping action scenes, particle effects and tech eye-candy. The higher framerate and the smooth animations make for some incredible, adrenaline-pumping action scenes and effects, that rarely ever been seen in anime before. The sci-fi/cyberpunk art direction is very well suited to this animation style, and creates some of the best looking scenes and landscapes I saw in ages. There is an obvious focus on realism regards to the tech, the animation and the story too, which gives the series a sense of consistency in place of the lacking characters.\\nWhile I was watching the last episode, I finally realized where I heard the name before. It was back in 2007, I played \"Guitar Hero 3: Legends Of Rock\", where I had to play a (then) relatively fresh Muse song with the title, yea you guessed it, \"Knights of Cydonia\". I remember it quite well, since it was a nightmare to get through that whole song on Expert. Funny enough, it has many common attributes with this anime: a pretty bland piece with bad pacing and plastic \"instruments\" but some pretty impressive technical flair that somehow makes it all worth it in the end.\\nAccording to the news, the second season is in production, so I\\'ll be waiting. I\\'m pretty intrigued as to where this path will lead.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3d809251b82a295e5a14f327b133f358'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Sidonia no Kishi follows the black sheep of Sidonia, Tanikaze Nagate. He\\'s an \\'underground\\' person who has lived underground in Sidonia since birth. He received elite training for piloting a Gardes since childhood by the Ace of Sidonia. One day, he finally comes up to the surface in search of food. There, a few incidences occured and he was enrolled in a school which trains Sidonians to become Gardes pilots.\\nI was skeptical about watching this anime due to it being generated by computer graphics in contrast to traditional animation, much like JoJo\\'s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders. However, unlike the latter, Sidonia no Kishi misses out\\non the little details of the faces with makes the face as smooth as a pebble. It might be awkward to look at at first but you\\'ll get used to it, I hope. The animations are much smoother than traditional animation which makes it more pleasurable to watch. The environment is immersive. It makes me feel like I\\'m in the world itself. Make sure you watch it on a big screen though, if not what I said was irrelevant. After completing, I feel that this anime needs the computer graphics since the story is set in space. The three dimension gives it a spacey feel.\\nThe music is not bad. I love the opening of Sidonia no Kishi, especially the \"Knights of Sidoniaaaa...\" chorus. The background music is well suited and choreographed to the on-screen action. As I basshead, I enjoyed the ending as well.\\nNow on to the characters. Nagate is just your typical hero who everyone dislikes at first but then something happened which made him famous. He is quite dense as he can\\'t seem to get the hint that a few girls like him. But he\\'s not all bad, Nagate is a caring person who would do anything to help his friends. Izana is just plain annoying in my opinion. She\\'s the kind of girl, wait...SHE\\'S NOT A GIRL! I\\'ll use it then since it\\'s a neutral gender. It is a kind of person who would get jealous whenever another girls tries to get close. Its attitude isn\\'t likeable at all. I wished it would have died instead of Hos...oh never mind no spoilers...\\nThis anime has an outstanding story but there is one big flaw, it\\'s rushed. I wished that it would have lasted longer, 12 episodes is just too short. I can feel that lot\\'s of important events are missing. I understand animating using computer graphics can be costly, but the director should put audience first instead of budget. But in this world where time is money, I don\\'t think such sentiments are fundamental at all.\\nAll in all, this anime is a must watch. I feel that it\\'s kind of underrated considering only a handful of people discuss about this anime. I really hope this anime gets a second season, it\\'s has a lot of potential.\\nThank you for reading my review! This is my first review so I hope it makes sense and that you like it.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Knights of Sidonia, or Sidonia no Kishi is a mecha manga series by Tsutomu Nihei (Blame, Biomega), which was serialized by Kodansha in ‘Afternoon’ between April 2009 and September 2015. The manga is localized in English by ‘Vertical.’ An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, aired between April and June 2014 and a second season aired between April and June 2015. An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, premiered on April 10, 2014 and ended its first season on June 26, 2014, on MBS and later on TBS, CBC and BS-TBS. The series was directed by Kobun Shizuno, assisted by Hiroyuki\\nSeshita, with scripts by Sadayuki Murai and character designs by Yuki Moriyama. The series has also been localized and streamed by Netflix in all of its territories since July 4, 2014, becoming the service's first original anime, as well as the first anime series on Netflix available in Dolby Vision/HDR. The first season has been licensed for home video release by Sentai Filmworks.\\nThe future is not favorable for humans anymore: our planet is no longer there, world population has decreased dramatically because of the gauna invasion, and there is a chance that humans can be completely annihilated. However, humans are known for their ability to adapt and this time they will not give up that easily. Many seed ships are being created, which are later sent in different parts of space and are designed to be the last stronghold of the human race. Although, seed ships do have weaponry, they use robots called gardes, or guardians to protect the main ship from any possible threat that might occur.\\nNot much is known about seed ships now, because the distance between them is so great (150 something light years) that it takes more than 100 years only for one message to be delivered. In this lovely setting, Knight of Sidonia tells the viewer a story of Sidonia, which is one of these seed ships. Sidonia has its own guardian Saitou Hiroki, who is a guardian’s pilot and Sidonia’s top 1 ace. However, one day, due to some circumstances, Hiroki refuses to take medicine anymore, which increases the life of any human, helping them to never age; he takes his grandson with him and hides from the people of Sidonia.\\nEventually, Hiroki dies and it forces his grandson to the surface. One of the Sidonia’s leaders immediately understands that Nagate is the only grandson of one of the greatest ace pilots Sidonia has ever had and that his grandson is believed to be as skilled as his grandad and sends him on a mission. Right on his very first mission, Tanikaze faces the main foe of humanity that has not attacked Sidonia for a long while—gauna.\\nWhile Sidonia Knights’ story-line does contain some cliché mecha elements that you surely know about, it has one of the richest story-lines you will ever see in anime: an absolutely new setting, it contains many sci-fi elements, and it is just able to keep you in the never ending suspension, leaving you absolutely no time for breath; you simply have no time to think, because you do not know what to expect from this series. By the way, there are two seasoning now and the third season is underway, which means that there will be even more new details.\\nP.S. Gauna are an alien lifeform that destroyed planet earth. The light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9.5 trillion kilometers, or 5.9 trillion miles.\\nKnight of Sidonia has some awesome CG, which help to keep action scenes flashy and mind-blowing. You can find Knights of Sidonia’s opening on youtube and you will get the idea how it is going to look like. Anyways, the animation manages to reflect that dark setting perfectly well, it also manages to keep the action scenes amazingly interesting to watch. However, my only problem with that is that while all character designs do look decent, I would have loved to see a better emotion portrayal for characters. Yet, it is not an anime about cute boys and girls doing cute things; the animation is good. Sound wise, Japanese dubbed version does a much better job than the English one. Sidonia no Kishi, as any mecha anime, has simply amazing OST, which was composed by Asakura Noriyuki, who also wrote the music for Rurouni Kenshin and Major. The opening theme ‘sidonia’ is performed by a Japanese pop band angela, which full version you should definitely check on youtube. They are notable for having their music portrayed as theme songs for several anime television shows. The band members are Atsuko(vocals) and Katsu(keyboard). Their signature upbeat tunes and rich arrangements combine elements of electronica, dance, rock, swing jazz and ska. The ending theme ‘show’ is performed by Eri Kitamura, who prefers j-rock, symphonic rock, symphonic metal, and pop rock. That said, Sidonia did surprise me with its opening and ending themes choice. The opening song sounds like a hymn to the last stronghold of humanity—seed ships, when the ending theme somewhat keeps you in suspension, making you want to watch the next episode as soon as possible; they both fit the anime well.\\nKnights of Sidonia has a very rich cast. Every character has its purpose in the series, they have their motives and aims they are trying to pursue. Although, it might take you some time to get used to these rather unusual characters that this anime has, since as it has been already been stated before, the main genre of this anime is sci-fi, so there will be many weird things. But even with that, all main and supporting characters are equally good. P.S. Do not mind the bear lady; Japan is a weird place.\\nOf course, this anime is not perfect, or flawless; nothing is. But I guarantee you that this series has more positive than negative sides. I cannot even call them serious flaws, they are just too minor for me to criticize. That said, Sidonia no Kishi, just like Evangelion, has the right to be called iconic mecha anime. It has a brand-new setting, as well as many elements, which have never been touched upon in any other sci-fi, or mecha anime.\\nAll in all, I give this anime a very weak 10/10. Even if you are not a fan of mecha, think of this series as a sci-fi series, which involves robots. Robots, as well as robot fights, are not the main focus of this anime. However, I have to say that this anime series has quite a bit of female nudity, along with some graphic violence, which makes it something that is not for kids. But do not be afraid, it does not have any unnecessary fanservice at all!\\nOne of the most innovative sci-fi series you will ever see!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6efdea2beba67ef48ce577296f0eef2b'}>,\n",

Do not afraid this series isn't a Shingeki no Kyojin wannabe, not to mention that the manga of this series started before Shingeki. In short the story is about humanity that\\nwas doomed because of the Gauna and humanity forced to escape to the space, hiding inside a massive ship, building their home there, and trying to live peacefully. Our hero is a underground teen who mastered the control of humanoid robot, used to fight off Gauna.

At first, this was the reason I didn't want to watch the series. However I heard many good things, positive reviews and critics for this show, so I decided to try this once more. It's really worth it! Gradually I begin to love the art, and the CG, also the great character designs.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Just finished watching Season 1. I will keep it short as much as I can...or I will be writing essays. Well, its been a while since I watched an anime, and particularly a mecha sci-fi anime. Of the mecha genre, many of today\\'s\\' franchises are dumbed down, cover in cliches, with overpowered God \"Gundams\", and characters with invincible plot armor. After watching KoS .... my mind was completely blown, good mecha anime actually exist I actually feared for my characters, the environments & setting were believable (Of course, its fiction not 100% realistic), and the writing & directing is incredibly engaging & well done. Down\\nfall would be the fact that the 1st season is only 12 episodes long, and feels like it could have been at least a 20 ep. season. Some people could point out that certain things can be considered cliches, however I personally found them more supportive then not distracting at all to the story. Character development is limited to just only 12 ep. and could be fleshed out better if there was opportunity of additional episodes. The CGi/animation can be considered between good & average for dialog scenes, however I am amazed by the detail of combat scenes, and each scene being mostly original. Music and scoring is considered good, none of the music is distracting and does a good job of drawing emotion from the scene to the viewer. However I will say not much of the scores are memorable except mainly for the opening theme song. In conclusion, this anime makes me feel at home, in a sense familiar, but at the same time new, fresh, and exciting. I am happy that for once that its not produced by studios like Sunrise. Polygon Picture efforts to step in to the mecha genre is very much appreciated. I give Knights of Sidonia Season 1 a strong 8/10, with my personal recommendations to those interested in military, mecha, sci-fi genres. Possibly one of the best of this genre I have ever seen. I will have determined that when season 2 is released. Oh one more thing, this is a Netflix exclusive anime, something we don\\'t see everyday, but a great reason to get netflix haha.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '19e95a852b8a3b8613372c7a4caebabc'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Sidonia no Kishi, aka \"Knights of Sidonia,\" can best be summed up as a collection of interesting elements that never reaches it\\'s potential.\\nThe story is set in the distant future, featuring space ships, war, a third gender,  and super powerful aliens known as Gauna. The Gauna in particular is where the story reaches it\\'s peak; these super-powered aliens which resemble machines are incredibly deadly and constantly evolving. You can really feel the fear the characters do when their squads are being cut down like butter, having to watch their comrades gruesomely die screaming.\\nThe third gender that is introduced is also one of it\\'s finer\\nideas. This hermaphroditic third gender can act as either male or female, depending on what Sidonia needs to bolster it\\'s population. But like the series as a whole, the idea is never entirely fleshed out. There is merely one episode dedicated to this fact, and it\\'s around one of the main characters, Izana. She falls in love with the main character and ultimately decides to become a girl, which is fine in it\\'s own right, but what being a third gender is like never explored enough, simply glossed over. Sexual identity, a big topic today, is never brought to terms with the third gender. It\\'s unfortunate that the idea wasn\\'t executed as well as it should have been.\\nThe characters in general aren\\'t unlikeable per se, but neither are they particularly interesting. Izana\\'s identity as a third gender is brushed aside after one episode. And every character has a bland design, looking nearly identical to everyone else and having vague motivations. The three protagonists all have short dark hair, with similar eyes and statures (including Izana). There\\'s the general chick whom has dark hair and wears a mask, with some vague history of a grudge or something and a silver haired prodigy of sorts whom is jealous of Nakate, the main protagonist, for taking a legendary ship or something. There\\'s also an old repair guy whom gets a few lines towards the end of the series, the main protagonists grandpa who\\'s mentioned several times for some sort of history and training Natake. A group of old guys whom run things and probably know stuff. Everyone amounts to nothing more than a bunch of vague \"somethings.\"\\nThat only scratches the surface as to the problem with the characters. Other than the fear factor the Gauna emanate, you\\'ll be asking yourself \"Why should I care about these people?\" Most of the story and characters give that impression regardless, and it\\'s mostly due to the perplexing elements that are never told or explained properly. Who? Why? When? How? These are questions which are too often never answered.\\nThe art is usually fantastic in it\\'s presentation, even if the \"high speed\" scenes can be difficult to follow sometimes, it\\'s usually good and battles often look slick. My only complaint, other than the aforementioned boring character designs, is that the majority of environments are bland and uninteresting. That may work for a series set in modern day Tokyo, but not one that takes place in the distant future in space. The sound is okay, usually- things that shoot go pew, things that blow up go boom. Yet neither are there any particularly memorable tracks or songs. I guess the patriotic opening was decent.\\nThe story harvests a bunch of good ideas together. Unfortunately, few of these ideas ever become ripe enough to be worth indulging. It becomes apparent by the eighth episode that it won\\'t ever be anything more than a mishmash of several good concepts, and in the end it fails to succeed at even a few basic, essential ones. You\\'ll finish it befuddled, wondering what could have been. By the following week, you\\'ll have forgotten everything about it, forever referring to it as \"that space anime I watched one time.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2997451a4134722393d336cbe92891b9'}>,\n",

I guess they know my tastes pretty well because once I finished the first episode I couldn\\'t stop watching until I had completed the entire 1st Season.\\nOnce you get over the initial shock of the animation style (an older CGI that reminded me of what lower-budget production studios might use, like at Roosterteeth) its really an interesting show with a lot of potential.  The sci-fi setting is great in that it takes the viewer away from what we normally know\\nliving on Earth.  The attention to detail on what living in a \"Seed Ship\" like Sidonia would be like is really very good - gravity, thrust, limited resources, population control, etc.  I\\'m a huge fan of hard-science-fiction and most movies and shows ignore these kinds of details, but Knights of Sidonia does not.\\nThe character development is pretty standard throughout, but the back story - the bigger picture - is what I really liked.  Details are slowly revealed throughout the season and it leaves a lot of potential for future seasons to come.  The action is really good and pretty dramatic, although sometimes short and a bit predictable.  To get back to the animation, it does grow on you, and looks amazing when \"zoomed out,\" and while not the best one must simply accept it as a part of the show and probably allowed this series to be made in the first place.\\nIn all, I liked Knights of Sidonia a lot.  It was well worth watching, and I think a 7 fits my general feelings and leaves room for improvement.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Knights of Sidonia:\\n\"What an incredible journey it has been\". I would say that I have watched enough anime to the point that I can have a valid view on a series and after watching a myriad of anime from garbage to great,this is by far one of the greats.\\nI have just been watching seasonal anime to the point that I just couldn\\'t anymore,with horrid communities forming around good anime,tainting it, therefore, I decided to take a break and watch something I had not thought about,something that peaked my interest that was rather under the radar or \"underrated\" and so Polygon Pictures take on Knights of\\nSidonia was my weapon of choice.\\nI have done many reviews on first episodes and Knights of Sidonia has a pretty solid one. It introduced us to a rather bland character who is fleshed out based off his situation and doesn\\'t prove to be annoying. The plot and world building in the first episode is minor but its use of dramatic progression sliced through with subtle,understated comedy really did engross me.\\nNow speaking about the fact that this anime is almost entirely cell shaded CGI, I honestly thought that I would drop the series for that specific reason, but I have watched enough anime to know that they can redeem themselves in other ways,however, Polygon Pictures did one hell of a job making this anime visually pleasing with the exception of a couple awkward angles,weird character representation and random frame drops. I can totally see why the studio went this way.\\nThe CGI makes for enticing battle scenes,pseudo realistic animation sequences and beautiful scenery,aswell as the gorgeous Tsumugi. One gripe I have with the anime especially in season 1 is the weird way the studio made use of lighting on surfaces but that is just nit picking at this point and I didn\\'t notice it when it came to season 2.\\nThe audio is by far one of my favourite parts about Knights of Sidonia. The musical score is magnificent,with a couple dedicated \"Knights of Sidonia\" tracks which carry over the emotions of the plot in perfect harmony,the dramatic musical sequences were my personal favourites apart from some of the battle scenes where vocal orchestra take over your ears and give you shivers down your spine.\\nWhen it comes to the OST you either love it or hate it,I personally skipped it every time as I feel it messed with my vibe when watching the anime especially due to the fact that I was binging it,the ED on the other hand is brilliant in both S1 and S2 and added a good ring to the end of each episode.\\nThe voice acting,awwwwww maaannnn the voice acting is really good. Toyosaki Aki and Suzaki Aya are brilliant Voice Actors who just breathe so much life into the characters they voice. Suzaki Aya even voices multiple characters throughout the series and does an incredible job making them all feel different yet have a sort of relation to them especially in tone.\\nNow for the verdict. This anime really played with my heart strings,I am pretty versatile when it comes to genre and when it comes to mixing romance and sci-fi, its not very often that they get it right. With Knights of Sidonia,they don\\'t quite get it right but the characters make everything in this series and they are not afraid to show it. This anime is rather old school in its plot progression as it relies almost solely on its characters and that is something that I absolutely love about this series.\\nSubtle hints to the plot direction told through how characters interact with one another and even down the the subtleties of how characters portray themselves in the anime which is strongly supported by the CGI in all honesty,it is enviable, something that isn\\'t done enough.\\nThis anime gives off some Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu vibes which is especially great if you have watched it before. This anime really makes you think about it and when I say \"it\" I mean \"knights of Sidonia\" specifically,it doesn\\'t cause you any existential dread bulls**t unless you really want it to,but it immerses you into its universe,helps you forget about whats happening around you in a good way.\\nI am so incredibly glad that I spent a couple night of days binging the s**t out of this anime because it really reminded me that there is still a reason to believe in humanity,even if it isn\\'t particularly what you asked for.\\nVisuals/Style&Design: 8/10\\nI wouldn\\'t care too much about this category but for those who do.\\nThe CGI is great,an incredible amount of assets are implemented throughout the anime so you don\\'t just get the same old boring designs all the time,other than the generic suits we are gifted with some well designed outfits which seem fit for a vision of what the fashion would be like in such a situation.Character design is relatively good compared to others in it\\'s segment but the anime puts emphasis on how these characters develop and how this is quite literally showed through their character designs.\\nThe Gauna,mech and tech designs are very good and actually surprised me as they all seem very much mechanically functional and come off as \"logical\".\\nAudio: 9/10\\nThis is Knights of Sidonia\\'s strongest category coupled with characters,the audio direction by Iwanami Yoshikazu is some of the best I have ever heard in an anime,this is especially noticeable in season 2,it carries over the emotions of the scene so perfectly and fits the anime like a glove.\\nAs I said before the voice acting is incredibly solid,all the characters feel real,even the side characters.\\nWhen it comes to general sound effects this anime will have you knocked off your boots,the sound effects from Tsumugi\\'s movements down to subtle distortion effect added in cockpits all make the anime sound believable.\\nCharacters: 9/10\\nTagged along for the best part of the show as they make Knights of Sidonia,\"Knights of Sidonia\". All the characters are layered deeply including many aside the main cast,character building and interaction really immerse you into the series. I am afraid to write more about this category as it may never end so I will end it here.\\nPlot & Worldbuilding:8/10\\nI found the plot interesting enough to make me watch the anime. It is pretty unique as it has a lot to build upon,however it was the characters specifically that made me stay to watch the anime and not the plot.\\nWorldbuilding is gradual but very well paced,I felt that by S2 I was satisfied with what we were given and am adamant in wait for S3.\\nIs it worth your time?\\nThis anime is most definitely worth your time,however, I would only recommend this to a person who is experienced when it comes to anime and manga as this is one of those anime that newbies will hate and degenerates will by far enjoy. {I may be wrong about that}\\nIf you have read to this point I am very grateful to you and you have my many thinks but if you are still skeptical about giving this anime a go,I would strongly recommend at least watching the first episode before you completely disregard it,you will not regret it.\\nOverall:8.5/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '31eb8ca54d6aa379a965a6e613347ed5'}>,\n",

I wouldn\\'t necessarily say it was awful , but was it good enough to stand out from the rest ? No. Is it worth watching ? Let\\'s find out shall we.\\n-----------\\nStory - 6\\n-----------\\nThe premise of the story is solid and competent but nothing unique.\\nEarth is destroyed , Humans now colonize in space on a giant spaceship which in now being attacked. But one of the glaring issues is while it supposed to be this dystopian setting , the viewer doesn\\'t really feel that tension. Beside a few civilians dying in one episode and a few civilian protest scenes , you would expect the environment to be more chaotic. The pacing feels rushed , nothing is properly explained , the show keeping throwing half-baked information at you and it gets rather confusing at times. The romantic subplots feels cheesy.., forced and awkward.\\nBeside it\\'s flaws , it does provide enough conflicts and space battles to keep the viewer interested , even tho most of it is cliché and predictable.\\n-----------\\nArt - 3\\n-----------\\nDear Polygon studio , what the fuck ?\\nOkay , I don\\'t hate CGI by default. I think CGI can look great when properly utilized , Ghost in the Shell : Innocence is a great example for that. But here , It\\'s an atrocity.\\nI feel like they could have at least put some effort into making the different characters look unique , But No. Even the main characters of the series are indistinguishable  from most of the side characters in the series. I was genuinely confused about who is who most of the time. This isn\\'t helped by the poor characterization which I\\'ll get into later.\\nAll the backgrounds and environments are kept pretty simple , which isn\\'t entirely a bad thing because it\\'s doesn\\'t feel bloated. Everything look black or white most of the times. Something that deserves fair points is how they animated the space battles , which looked fairly good most of the times , everything felt smooth and the effects were adequate.\\n-------------\\nSound - 6\\n-------------\\nThis is where a series like this could have truly shined. But sadly , Musical score of the series is almost non-existent. I value the soundtrack of a series very highly , and I felt this series could have profited from a good soundtrack and the lack of it was clearly apparent.\\nBut what they should receive major points for the fantastic opening theme , which I never skipped even though I was bing watching the show and heard it 10 times in the past 12 hours.\\nI should also point out that the sound effects on the series was really well done , so plus points for that.\\n-----------------\\nCharacters - 3\\n-----------------\\nOh boy! , This is one of the sections that the series really faltered. I already mentioned that the characters were indistinguishable from each other because of the poor characters designs and the artwork , that really highlights how poor the characterization were. They didn\\'t just simply look the same , there were no unique characteristics to identify them , most of them had any unique personalities and was pretty generic.\\nThe main character was one of the most boring and bland protagonists I\\'ve seen in quite a while. In the first episode , his introduction was him stealing bread and doing somethings he shouldn\\'t be doing. You would expect some kind of punishment , But the writers say \"Well , Fuck that\" and gives him a job as a pilot ?\\nI did hoped that the main character would get some development later on but character development was ignored here , almost completely. The MC was the same bland and interesting character when the series ended as when it started.\\nMost of the female characters in the show are there as romantic interests for the main character , and not interesting or unique , although fairly likable.\\nSo in short , characters are bland and uninteresting.\\n----------------------------------------------\\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 5\\n----------------------------------------------\\nEnjoyment ? Honestly , not that much. The most enjoyable part for me was the opening theme. At times it felt like a chore mostly because I had to put in an effort to even differentiate characters from each other. and I expected more out of the soundtrack.\\nWould I recommend it ? No , But if you really like Mecha\\'s ,Love Triangles and Space battles , you might want to give it a try.\\n---------------------------\\n| Recommendations |\\n---------------------------\\n[Neon Genesis Evangelion] Just a much better Dystopian Mecha series , that excels and blows Sidonia out of the water in every department.\\n[Attack on Titan] A series that truly captures the desperation and intensity of what it feels like to be corned and attacked as a race.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '160c8cc6a5332b66311cabc486876243'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'In terms of the western market, the anime industry has been accelerating at a rapid rate since the reintroduction of Toonami to the television lineup in 2012. On the TV front, we had the first instance of a dub premiering at the same time as its original subbed version with Space Dandy at the beginning of this year, and even more progress has been made with the introduction of FUNimation\\'s Broadcast Dubs this Fall, allowing fans access to the top dubbed series months before they would normally premiere. Even those outside the industry are beginning\\nto invest in it. For the first time, Netflix has acquired the exclusive license to stream a certain anime title in the West, and it has already displayed plans to continue this trend in the future. So, how did the very first \"Netflix Original\" anime fare?\\nIn terms of what type of science fiction this series goes for, it takes on the mantle of very straight and fact-based sci-fi, and the laws of physics and nature come into play very often. Ideas like propulsion and acceleration become key concepts when determining how battles sway and how life prospers on board the \"Sidonia,\" and this ends up making battles a lot more thrilling and exciting because the lack of fantastical plot armor creates some extremely tense situations and often results in extremely high death tolls during battles. This turned what would have otherwise been an extremely generic plot into a captivating experience.\\nThat being said, the truly generic nature of the plot itself is nearly unbearable at some points, and I found myself making a gagging motion whenever the standard dialogue clichés started popping up. There were also a lot of points where things just didn\\'t make any sense. Without spoiling anything, there comes a point where Nagate messes up during a mission and it causes a big problem. Then, after the mission, one of the other soldiers actually beams him in the head with a rock. Now only was this infuriating on the level of \"this crap probably wouldn\\'t fly in an actual military,\" but also on the level of \"here\\'s that clichéd plot point where everyone hates the main character after he messes up, but then he does really well in the next mission so they\\'re ok with him again.\" And, I kid you not, there is actually a montage scene where they flash between different moments on Nagate\\'s rise up in power and respect within the military. This is just a sample of the unbelievably terrible writing that takes places between the epic thrills of each battle.\\nCharacters really don\\'t do much to differentiate themselves from their standard tropes either. Nagate is probably the most fleshed-out of the cast, but even his background of living in the underground alleys of \"Sidonia\" felt a bit generic. From there on out, between token love interests with no personality other than \"love interest,\" and a quite literal bully character with very few redeeming qualities, the characters really don\\'t do much to make themselves stand out. Character interactions also feel a bit forced at times, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the fact that there are enough main characters fawning over Nagate to fill a small harem for any other anime. By the time they had added a fourth love interest, my eyes were about to swivel back into my head so hard that they\\'d fall out of their sockets.\\nAnd then, there\\'s the bear. There is literally a talking bear with a robotic arm that actually gets to be a main character...just let that sink it for a minute. I don\\'t know if this was their attempt to insert some kind of comic relief despite the fact that the bear never does anything comical, but if it was, then it worked just about as well as every single forced comedic relief scene in this series.\\nThe animation was produced by Polygon Pictures, and to my knowledge, this is the first television anime series to be animated completely in 3D rendered models. This ended up creating an incredibly stark contrast in animation quality. On the plus side, the action sequences were some of the best I\\'ve seen from this year, with every single movement choreographed and animated to near perfection. The heavy attention to explosions and particles effects also added a great deal to every fight, though some felt less realistic than others. On the reverse side of this category, any animation that wasn\\'t a fight sequence ranged from incredibly mediocre to unbelievably awful. The characters have an extremely limited range of facial features, blushing and crying looking extremely jagged and unnatural, and any sort of body movement looks severely robotic and completely destroys any attempt at immersing you in this story.\\nOn the dub front, I actually couldn\\'t tell you who exactly dubbed this series, but I can tell you that we have definitely found a fundamental flaw in Netflix\\'s business plan for original anime series. I do have to give credit to Johnny Yong Bosch and Todd Haberkorn (credited as Todd Stone) though, but saying that those two were good in a dub is practically unnecessary since they\\'ve been voice acting legends for at least the past decade. Unfortunately, aside from a minor role by Spike Spencer (Shinji of Neon Genesis Evangelion), I did not recognize a single name on this dub cast. Upon further research, I discovered that a good portion of them had never even done any anime voice acting before they were cast for this series, and the effects of this were plain to seen. I personally was able to slosh through the dub because it\\'s a heavy action series and Bosch can in fact carry an entire cast by himself, but I would not blame you in the slightest if you switched to subbed while watching this. Hopefully Netflix will learn from their mistakes before they begin their work on The Seven Deadly Sins.\\nThe music was composed by Noriyuki Asakura of Rurouni Kenshin fame, and his mastery of soundtrack composition has certainly evolved since the late 90s. Battle sequences were always accompanied by grand and epic orchestrations mixed with heavy guitar work and electronics, while more intense non-battle scenes often carried creepy electronic elements; I will say that I felt somewhat unmoved by some of the softer tracks though. The opening theme \"Sidonia\" was performed by angela and plays us in with a heavy techno beat back by a march-inspired feel, while the ending theme \"show\" by Eri Kitamura plays us out with a heavy rock track. Additionally, both of these tracks are available for purchase on iTunes, and I would definitely recommend checking them out.\\nOverall, I\\'m once again left in a quandary over whether or not to recommend Knights of Sidonia. There are a ton of really, really awful moments in this series, yet I was still able to watch the next episode without any pause for a break. Ultimately, I\\'m feeling a bit generous towards it since it\\'s the first anime exclusively licensed by a streaming company outside the direct anime industry, and any attempt to promote and expand anime in the western market should always be given a chance.\\nIf you like heavy action anime, then definitely give this one a shot, but otherwise stay clear of it.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3279338ed7108c3baa7a827946594dc6'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Sidonia was probably one of the best animes I attended in 2014 and one of my favorites that have followed to this day. I never thought I would get used to an animation made entirely in CG. But the story, the soundtrack, the direction and the characters were so good I ended up falling in love with the work. I was very happy when I saw the first season sold enough and even more when it was announced the second season already for 2015. Sidonia is sensational and deserves to be seen almost as an obligation.\\nThe story of Sidonia in Kishi takes place in a\\ndistant future, in a reality that has forced humans to flee the Earth in various spacecraft due to alien attack known as Gauna. Many of these spacecraft ended up dividing and forming their own societies within themselves. The work deals with the ship Sidonia, where residents have developed, in order to survive, cloning, the third sex and photosynthesis superhuman. Its main objective is to find another planet in a solar system that will allow the survival as it was before the earth.\\nThe plot revolves around Tanikaze Nagate, protagonist who spent years of his life living in the city\\'s unknown underground with his grandfather, who taught him everything about Gaunas and how to defeat them. There he learned to use a simulator of locks they use to fight them, called Gardes. After the death of his grandfather, Nagate was forced and explore more Sidonia to find food, and it is from there that our protagonist arrives on the surface and becomes a Knight of Sidonia.\\nTo write a good script sci-fi, the author needs to have a strong ability to build a world. Sidonia in Kishi has a large and complex created universe. Both technological and scientific terms as the organization of society and Sidonia culture. And even though this season has little exploited this excellent and promising created partly SnK still had a great narrative momentum. It was simply inevitable reach the end of an episode and do not want to watch the next madly. The anime can easily engage and keep the viewer\\'s attention, either in the action scenes or the moments of tranquility. One of the good narrative impulses anime was in the show that beautiful scenery of outer space and the relationship between Nagate and Hoshijiro.\\nAnother nice detail of sci-fi is that no other \"gender\" as this allows clear vision in black and white battle between \"good\" and \"evil\", independent of gears and conflicts that revolve around it and the very concept employed in the work. In Sidonia this is also done with great intelligence by Tsutomu Nihei-sensei.\\nSidonia is not a cyberpunk. It is not intended, unfortunately, exploring the philosophical terms about all the technological changes that employ in the characters\\' lives and society as a whole. It sure would be very cool if explore more in the political sense all these issues because there really are very interesting. Even the most cited were not developed as human photosynthesis, who came to help the food shortage causing everyone need only once a week go through this process to meet the body needs, as the third sex, which allows person can choose over time if you prefer a man or woman, and cloning itself, a system that keeps your brain alive, but in an immortal body.\\nIf there\\'s something I too liked in Sidonia was the leisurely pace that anime had. Despite the many action-packed moments, the whole story was told quite calm and serenity, about to leave the feeling that this season was just an introduction to the real conflicts and reflections that everyone will face just ahead. This moderate pace also matched perfectly with that cold work. Yes. Sidonia in Kishi is cold. The people are cold. Humanity is completely different. And all this coldness is nothing more than a proper reflection of modern society in which they live.\\nBut after all, what they seek? Salvation? A new planet in a solar system as was the Earth would be, yes, victory in this great battle for the salvation of the people of Sidonia.\\nThe anime Sidonia in Kishi was undoubtedly a wonderful surprise. I never thought it was so good. You can easily notice that everything in the story is well done and thought that the plot really has something more than several works there. This 12 episodes were wonderful and from what I saw adapted very well the original material.

These Gauna creatures are\\nrather interesting since they are portayed as having superior intelectual capabilities(although they don\\'t prove it), having the ability to mimic the human body as well as other various diffrent abilities.\\nWhy was a 3rd gender created? What is this 3rd gender person attracted to and does it think like a woman or a man? This \"3rd gender\"  has no genital organs, being able to change it\\'s genitals to male/female based on their mating partner. That only comes out weird, since females have female mentality and are attracted to males and males have male mentality and are attracted to females,\\nthis 3rd gender has no place.\\nIn the second season, unfortunately the anime jumps from action to harem for about 4 episodes, it is not very bad but not good either.\\nThe creators overdid the Hoshijiro drama, keeping to bring back her human body after she died, just to add some drama and show some \"touching\" moments. I think in the end, the copy of Hoshijiro will somehow recover her original memories, even if the original Hoshijiro is dead.\\nUnfortunately, everything is unclear, not much is explained about the Gauna, the way these creatures are/were created, their origins, their motives or exactly how humanity was driven to the brink of extinction, leaving the viewer with many questions that will probably never be answered.\\nCharacters: 4/10\\nThe characters come in great numbers but they are all a mess, none of them receive any decent characterization, background story or solid character development. I will not go into details since it is not neccessary, hoping an eventual 3rd season will solve the character problem.\\nAnimation: 8/10\\nI personally enjoyed the animation, it is fluid and the art is nice and well suited to the show theme but the character art is blunt. At first the animation may feel weird since it is 3DCGI but as soon as you get adjusted you will like it.\\nSound: 8/10\\nThe 1st season has an amazing opening theme, nice ending theme, good background sound and good voice actors.\\nThe 2nd season has a decent opening theme, amazing ending theme, good background sound and good voice actors.\\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\nFor some reason I don\\'t know, even if the show is not very good, I really enjoyed the series, especially the fight scenes.\\nOverall: 6.5/10\\nA fairly good mecha/space anime that is more than entertaining, fast paced and can easily be finished in one sitting.

I loved Tanikaze and found him adorable with his constant cluelessness and his penchant for getting seriously injured.\\nHowever, unlike Attack on Titan (to which Knights of Sidonia is being justly compared), this universe feels much more sterile, with more technology and fewer colors, relationships, and characterizations. The character designs for the cadets in particular are extremely similar, almost clones of one another (11 are sisters who all look like twins), which makes it difficult to keep track of many of the cadets except poor Tanikaze and his rival, Kunato.

Fortunately Sidonia no Kishi comes to prove this theory wrong. The main concept of this anime is simple (mankind at the edge of extinction and humans fighting against monsters in order to survive) it reminds a lot SNK's plot but it stays interesting in it's own way. A lot of things remained unexplained and the ending is preparing us for a huge cliffhanger that is going to happen in the next season. The thing that made this anime stand out among the\\nothers was the fact that it was made entirely by CGI animation a thing that made a lot of people drop it. After watching it have to say that this is the biggest mistake somebody could make. While not a big fun of CGI animation myself I have to admit that the animation studio did an excellent job with this anime. The world of Sidonia as well the outer space are beautifully animated same goes with the character design . There are of course some flaws like some lagging movements in a couple of scenes as well as the kinda weak Gauna design but the animators put such an effort in their job that they have gained my respect. The opening was a really awesome battle anthem that enters you into the anime's atmosphere and the ending was pretty catchy and very fitting for every episodes conclusion.The OST's were pretty good too especially the battle theme. I had a little problem with the voice acting though. The VA's sounded a little bit off in some scenes but overall they made a descent job. The biggest problem of this anime was the character section. The story is developed only around the main protagonist Nagate. Nagate is the one who will defeat the Gauna, Nagate is the one that will get all the fame and girls (the anime can indirectly labeled also as a harem anime XD) and everything in the story will be ''Nagate this'' and ''Nagate that''. Either way the story unfolds somewhere in the middle why Nagate is getting all the acknowledgement but still I would like to see a little bit more of a character development in the other characters too.

You\\'ll find an uptempo, visually appealing show with a lot of action and solid world building here and I\\'d definitely recommend this show to fans of the genre.\\nArt-\\nThe visuals here are well above the norm and there is no shortage of flashy scenes designed to wow you. The world is beautifully drawn, the combat scenes are intense and many aspects of the environment are highly detailed. There may be an overuse\\nof CGI in this series as a whole and that may turn off anime purists,  but undeniably this is a sharp looking show.\\nSound-\\nKnights of Sidonia Season 1 has one of my all time favorite intro songs, which I instantly added to my playlist upon completing the series, and have subsequently always enjoyed any time it\\'s come up. Beyond that I found the sound quite average. The music beyond the intro was solid and fine but didn\\'t stand out in any way and likewise the voice acting, while there aren\\'t any glaring problems with it, felt very run of the mill for an anime with a good budget behind it. No character stood out to me as having an outstandingly good or clearly terrible voice performance.\\nCharacter/Story-\\nThe base premise and world building here are immediately gripping. There is absolutely a sense of danger and desperation in this show and there is no shortage of action or questions to be answered. Unfortunately, only some of those questions do indeed get answered. The show steps on the gas pedal pretty early on and rarely lets off of it.\\nCharacter development and interpersonal relationships both leave a bit to be desired, as tends to be inevitable with 12 episode anime, but the characters that we do get a chance to know are largely interesting and are not cookie cutter or copy/pasted from other shows.\\nThere are definitely some anime cliches to be found here, but none are inexcusable. Nevertheless, this is very much one of those \"the main character is more powerful/skilled/special than everyone else, all the girls want him, he\\'s the chosen one, etc\" kind of shows.\\nEnjoyment-\\nWhat kept the story engaging for me was the world-building, the mystery surrounding the enemy and the details of what the heck is up with one particular character, which I cannot talk about further without spoilers.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'So many of my friends, and some who I consider to have good taste in anime, recommended Knights of Sidonia to me, so I came into it wtih high expectations, always a mistake. After the first episode I dropped it for awhile, but my curiosity over the large purple space monster pulled me back in.\\nKnights of Sidonia is a gorgeously animated sci-fi \\'Last of the human race in a colony ship\\' series with entertaining space battles and perfect use of CGI. unfortunately, that was about all it had to offer.\\nStory:\\nThe conflict with the Gauna is pretty much the extent of the story here, which is\\nfine considering that the show is about the struggle to preserve the human race due to problems caused by the Gauna in the first place. However, this meant that the parts of the show devoted to other things, to the pilot\\'s free time, just felt like a waste. The world of Sidonia, while beautiful, wasn\\'t developed enough to make me feel like it was an actual place. I could have derived a similar amount of enjoyment from looking at an art book of this series.\\nAnyway, the Gauna destroyed earth in the year 2371 CE and several colony ships scattered into deep space in an hopes that humans might one day colonize another planet, but the ever-present Gauna threat means they will have to be dealt with before humanity can achieve that goal. Throughout the series, I didn\\'t get the sense that anything was progressing aside from humanities ability to combat these giant space monsters which affirmed the fact that the Gauna conflict was the only thing actually happening. There are vague hints at political unrest but it\\'s ultimately unimportant in the grand scheme of things.\\nOne of my favorite parts was when three of the characters explored the city and reading Sidonian lore, I though this might lead to something interesting that wasn\\'t space battles but it ended up tying right back into it.\\nCharacters:\\nNone of the characters were particularly memorable, in fact, after watching it recently I can only remember the name of one.\" NAGATE!\" screamed every girl he had ever met while staring in horror as the Gauana wreaked havoc in a manner reminiscent of Krillin gaping uselessly at Vegeta using his powers. Unfortunately, this isn\\'t DBZ, and that trope is inexcusable in an action anime that takes itself seriously.\\nThe relationships between characters is almost Victorian. The sexual tension is so awkward it\\'s hard to watch and everyone is stoic to the point of not having a personality at all. There\\'s a girl with green hair and a mole who actually gets some character development but it\\'s not enough to relieve the frustration.\\nHowever, the biggest issue is that all the characters are part of the military despite the fact that they are hopelessly ill suited to combat. They make irrational decisions, shut down in the face of danger, and behave in ways that are outright detrimental to themselves and their comrades, in and out of combat. The commander actually listens to her pilots when they have a good idea, which was a nice break from the constant barrage of authority figures in most shows who never listen to anyone ever.\\nNagate\\'s character is actually okay. He doesn\\'t have much going on other than being a really good pilot, but that\\'s okay considering he\\'s lived underground his whole life with one other person, and devoted all his free time to pilot simulations. It makes sense that he\\'d have zero social skills.\\nAnimation & Direction (Space battles):\\nThis is exactly what I want to see out of a mecha, space battle anime. While it isn\\'t really a mecha show per se, all of combat takes place inside them. The problem I have with mecha (and most action anime) in general is amount of time spent shouting the names of your moves, charging energy, and flashing lights without any actually action. The combat is fast paced, pretty to look at, and easy to follow. It\\'s never chaotic, and things can only be hard to follow because every mech looks the same. However, this fits in with the uniform, militaristic style of the show, so it\\'s not a problem at all. It\\'s hard to put into words how well done the combat is because it\\'s so rare to see anything like it. This was what kept me coming back along with the desire to learn more about the Gauna.\\nCharacter Design:\\nThe character design is realistic and consistent. Not a single character\\'s design break immersion. Realistic hair color (even the green haired girl\\'s hair is muted eough to not be distracting) , and similar faces, you get the impression that they have homogenized over years of cloning/being grown in test tubes. Unfortunately, they are also pretty similar and easy to get confused because of it.\\nStyle/Aesthetic:\\nLike I mentioned before, Knights of Sidnoia depicts consistent realism. It never deviated from this despite the space battles and Sidonia being drastically different, both in terms of pacing and content. This brings me to my next point.\\nPacing:\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s because the characters mostly lacked personality, or the absence of world building, but the segments of the show spent in Sidonia, which comprise most of the show, are really, really slow. There needed to be something other than shots of generic looking characters walking through gray hallways and reserved, uninteresting dialogue and there just wasn\\'t. I wanted to see Sidonia, I wanted to learn about it\\'s inhabitants, but I got almost nothing in those areas.\\nSound:\\nFantastic sound effects. Never have I heard weapons with so much Oomph. The sound really conveys just how devastating these weapons are. The score was properly dramatic for a fast paced robot vs. massive alien space battle.\\nIntro/Outro\\nThe opening theme was perfect for the show. I wasn\\'t crazy about it, but I acknowledged that one would be hard pressed to find a more appropriate song. The ending theme was a little energetic and dramatic for the tone of the show, but sounded cool.\\nIf anyone knows of an anime with animation on par with this show that actually has interesting characters, an intriguing story and decent world building, please let me know.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '92c12460164e5056ddeda7534999bd80'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"--Additional information--\\nKnights of Sidonia, or Sidonia no Kishi is a mecha manga series by Tsutomu Nihei (Blame, Biomega), which was serialized by Kodansha in ‘Afternoon’ between April 2009 and September 2015. The manga is localized in English by ‘Vertical.’ An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, aired between April and June 2014 and a second season aired between April and June 2015. An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, premiered on April 10, 2014 and ended its first season on June 26, 2014, on MBS and later on TBS, CBC and BS-TBS. The series was directed by Kobun Shizuno, assisted by\\nHiroyuki Seshita, with scripts by Sadayuki Murai and character designs by Yuki Moriyama. The series has also been localized and streamed by Netflix in all of its territories since July 4, 2014, becoming the service's first original anime, as well as the first anime series on Netflix available in Dolby Vision/HDR. The first season has been licensed for home video release by Sentai Filmworks.\\n--Story-line--\\nThe future is not favorable for humans anymore: our planet is no longer there, world population has decreased dramatically because of the gauna invasion, and there is a chance that humans can be completely annihilated. However, humans are known for their ability to adapt and this time they will not give up that easily. Many seed ships are being created, which are later sent in different parts of space and are designed to be the last stronghold of the human race.  Although, seed ships do have weaponry, they use robots called gardes, or guardians to protect the main ship from any possible threat that might occur.\\nNot much is known about seed ships now, because the distance between them is so great (150 something light years) that it takes more than 100 years only for one message to be delivered. In this lovely setting, Knight of Sidonia tells the viewer a story of Sidonia, which is one of these seed ships. Sidonia has its own guardian Saitou Hiroki, who is a guardian’s pilot and Sidonia’s top 1 ace. However, one day, due to some circumstances, Hiroki refuses to take medicine anymore, which increases the life of any human, helping them to never age; he takes his grandson with him and hides from the people of Sidonia.\\nEventually, Hiroki dies and it forces his grandson to the surface. One of the Sidonia’s leaders immediately understands that Nagate is the only grandson of one of the greatest ace pilots Sidonia has ever had and that his grandson is believed to be as skilled as his grandad and sends him on a mission. Right on his very first mission, Tanikaze faces the main foe of humanity that has not attacked Sidonia for a long while—gauna.\\nWhile Sidonia Knights’ story-line does contain some cliché mecha elements that you surely know about, it has one of the richest story-lines you will ever see in anime: an absolutely new setting, it contains many sci-fi elements, and it is just able to keep you in the never ending suspension, leaving you absolutely no time for breath; you simply have no time to think, because you do not know what to expect from this series. By the way, there are two seasoning now and the third season is underway, which means that there will be even more new details.\\n--Note--\\nGauna are an alien lifeform that destroyed planet earth. The light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9.5 trillion kilometers, or 5.9 trillion miles.\\n--Art/Sound--\\nKnight of Sidonia has some awesome CG, which help to keep action scenes flashy and mind-blowing. You can find Knights of Sidonia’s opening on youtube and you will get the idea how it is going to look like. Anyways, the animation manages to reflect that dark setting perfectly well, it also manages to keep the action scenes amazingly interesting to watch. However, my only problem with that is that while all character designs do look decent, I would have loved to see a better emotion portrayal for characters. Yet, it is not an anime about cute boys and girls doing cute things; the animation is good. Sound wise, Japanese dubbed version does a much better job than the English one. Sidonia no Kishi, as any mecha anime, has simply amazing OST, which was composed by Asakura Noriyuki, who also wrote the music for Rurouni Kenshin and Major. The opening theme ‘sidonia’ is performed by a Japanese pop band angela, which full version you should definitely check on youtube. They are notable for having their music portrayed as theme songs for several anime television shows. The band members are Atsuko(vocals) and Katsu(keyboard). Their signature upbeat tunes and rich arrangements combine elements of electronica, dance, rock, swing jazz and ska. The ending theme ‘show’ is performed by Eri Kitamura, who prefers j-rock, symphonic rock, symphonic metal, and pop rock. That said, Sidonia did surprise me with its opening and ending themes choice. The opening song sounds like a hymn to the last stronghold of humanity—seed ships, when the ending theme somewhat keeps you in suspension, making you want to watch the next episode as soon as possible; they both fit the anime well.\\n--Characters--\\nKnights of Sidonia has a very rich cast. Every character has its purpose in the series, they have their motives and aims they are trying to pursue. Although, it might take you some time to get used to these rather unusual characters that this anime has, since as it has been already been stated before, the main genre of this anime is sci-fi, so there will be many weird things. But even with that, all main and supporting characters are equally good. P.S. Do not mind the bear lady; Japan is a weird place.\\n--Criticism (does not contain spoilers)--\\nOf course, this anime is not perfect, or flawless; nothing is. But I guarantee you that this series has more positive than negative sides. I cannot even call them serious flaws, they are just too minor for me to criticize. That said, Sidonia no Kishi, just like Evangelion, has the right to be called iconic mecha anime. It has a brand-new setting, as well as many elements, which have never been touched upon in any other sci-fi, or mecha anime.\\n--Overall--\\nAll in all, I give this anime a very weak 10/10. Even if you are not a fan of mecha, think of this series as a sci-fi series, which involves robots. Robots, as well as robot fights, are not the main focus of this anime.  However, I have to say that this anime series has quite a bit of female nudity, along with some graphic violence, which makes it something that is not for kids. But do not be afraid, it does not have any unnecessary fanservice at all!\\nOne of the most innovative sci-fi series you will ever see!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a189b6692d62b0037baf111ca5604efc'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Knights of sidonia-an anime made by netflix. That alone got me pretty stoked to watch this, honestly who thought it would be any good? Well, I can quite honestly say it was. At first, the anime might put you off-awkward character designs that are clones of each other and terrible voice acting so none of the words are in sync. They used 3d rendering as opposed to normal 2d for most anime, and this explains the awkward character design, but where these types of animations excel are within the space scenes. they are so incredibly detailed and have depth so all the gauna appear larger\\nthan life. Its a double edged sword, as it makes for weaker character designs but unique and epic space fight scenes.\\nSo for a pros and cons list, here it goes-Very in depth story with a few sudden plot twists, but very plain jane bland characters to help support them. They say a lot of lines that sound like everyday conversation at a grocery market, which is slightly annoying because some of the character actions are pretty interesting. Like all the immense planning that comes into defeating every single gauna and the factor that theirs always some cost associated with it-I mean large scale sacrifice. This actually makes the story a bit intriguing as the character actions are always associated with some sort of sacrifice, which is almost like a sub-theme here. (this is mostly where the attack on titans comparison comes from probably).\\nSound is used super sparingly in the anime itself, but as for intro and outros the Beethoven-techno intro is pretty cool and grand. The outro is slightly metalcore in addition, like a watamote intro.\\nSo did i like this anime? yes. Did i love it? no. Theirs alot of room for improvement, and i hope they expand upon this in the 2nd season. Its good for any sci-fi fan most certainly, or if you even like mech animes. Great action and a pretty realistic take on a very unrealistic story are what make this anime worth watching.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9765f723a229eeec450718519210dd40'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"SPOILER REVIEW\\nCharacters are more important than stories. However, if a story is very good, and the characters inside serve their purpose well enough, then it can still scrape by. Knight of Sidonia manages to make me care about the outcome of the character's struggles even though I don't really give a crap about anyone in particular. That's a rare thing, and should be commended.\\nSTORY: There's something primal in this show that forces me to care. Desperation. Their struggles with an eldritch force that threatens to wipe them out at every turn is survival at its core, and that's something everybody can relate to. They don't\\nneed to build up some dramatic struggle between morality and beliefs to make you care, you care because you can relate so well to what they're going through.\\nThe battles really are the highlight of this show. They are masters when it comes to conveying desperation. At the beginning of every battle, everybody's focused, morale is high, and they have a plan ready to go. Then, they start taking casualties. The plan falls apart at the seams. People start panicking, some act out of turn because their friends are dying, and all their professionalism melts away in the face of terror. The people of Sidonia can do nothing but sit and listen as their defense force suffers more and more casualties, and pray for their survival.\\nThe Gauna never stop being a threat in this show. They inflict major casualties on every single squad that's deployed to attack them. Every single time, the survivors just limp back home, traumatized. This is a nice change of pace, considering how many other anime sort of ditch the supernatural creatures being a threat partway through.\\nI was startled to realize during the climax that I actually cared about a character who seemingly was about to die. Not because I liked her, mind you. I couldn't even remember her name. But she was the one giving orders around there. If she died, then the whole mission would fall apart, and everybody on the squad would die. Very few anime nowadays have made me genuinely scared for somebody.\\nCHARACTER: Not special. In any way. I can't remember anybody's names, BUT they do their job well. For instance, I felt genuine sympathy for one of the side characters in episode 2, where she reflects on how her family and friends all pinned their hopes on her as she's about to be consumed. I felt  angry when a character got someone killed out of pure jealously.\\nOne of my favorite episodes in this show was when the MC is stranded in the middle of space with another character. They built a relationship up not through talking or ecchi moments, but by relying on each other for comfort in a very trying time. The relationship was so believable and well developed that I felt genuinely sad when the character was killed off next episode, and I sympathized with the main character's emotional state afterwards.\\nThe characters all work by being relatable. They have no other distinguishable character traits other than being human, and that's a sadly rare trait in anime. Unfortunately, there aren't many other traits, so I can't give character that good a score.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '24fbbcefaefe516d40f2be61f41ae594'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Let me start off with this. I have never written a review before. So this\\'ll be \\'fun\\'\\nSidonia no Kishi, or Knights of Sidonia, takes place in a post-apocalypse setting.\\nNo no no, not like Fallout or Mad Max, bur rather in space.\\nHumans live on this ship called \"Sidonia\" and despite what first impression that may have, the ship is actually capable of having 500,000 people inhabiting it.\\nWhile this was apparently an issue, they had also genetically modified humans to be able to photosynthesize, requiring only sunlight and eating once per week.\\nI\\'m trying not to give to much away, but the humans are running from something while\\ntrying to find a new home. Now that the setup is out of the way...\\nCharacters- I won\\'t lie, some of them are pretty forgettable, but the ones that were important to the story were very memorable and very...well, you may get attached to them a little. Some of the characters I found were good, but the lack of love and screen time to background or support characters was disappointing. I don\\'t wanna spoil anything, but I was attached to one character in particular and had gotten kinda angry about it later.\\nArt- WHOA, IS THIS CGI?! Yes, yes it is. BUT WAIT. its not that bad. I actually thought the art style was VERY well done. Of course your always going to have moments where its very obvious and sticks out like a sore thumb.\\nThe art style was actually very fitting. Characters looked neat and well designed, and were animated very well. I do think Polygon studios took advantage of no gravity for some moments where their movements are...less than elegant, but it seemed natural anyway. Environments were very well done and the theme of Sidonia was kinda scary and sad, while at the same time looking extravagant and beautiful.\\nThe color palette was not too bland either, showing off a diversity of the spectrum in some areas more than others of course, but having the environment fit the mood of the scene really well.\\nSound-  I was not impacted at all by the soundtrack. It wasn\\'t terrible, but it wasn\\'t amazing either. However, when there was a scene that really REALLY needed a good BGM, it was. Asakura Noriyuki composed the soundtrack, and he made it fit very well within the setting and it would not be too much or too little. The style was really good, I\\'ll give him that.\\nStory- I for one, have not seen a story like this. It was really good and you actually kinda worry about how the protagonists are gonna make it through this. Later on they introduce a very important plot element that they unfortunately could not elaborate on, but a second season is confirmed now and I for one can\\'t wait to see how that unfolds. Most of the story centers around Nagate Tanikaze, as he is the protagonist and is foreshadowed to be very very important despite how the rest of the characters make him look...average.\\nOne thing that did bother me was the pacing. The show actually starts right up and gets you hooked immediately, with their being a deployment in the first episode and seeing the kind of horror their facing. However, after a few episodes they slooooow dooown and do some character development. Not that character development is bad, it was only because the show had immediately hooked you in with the action and the awe of the first couple episodes only to stop entirely for about 4 episodes. Then after that, its deployment after deployment. I may also add in just this quick line, all of the \"sci-fi\" in this show, is all completely plausible. (barring perhaps the photosynthesizing...although.. >.> )\\nand finally, the mechs- Their...nothing special. Their really not. Take in mind, I do not consider this a bad thing, but something you may care about. All of them, are the same. Same design, same weapons, same capabilities. This is not Gundam. However, I love how they used them. The Garde\\'s could join together to get more thrust of out their engines. By join together, I mean they literally held onto each others arms in what they call a clasp formation. Much of the technology uses  Heigus particles (Higgs Boson particles) to do one thing or another. The most seen and obvious use of this, is in the Garde. They are more or less \"lasers\" to simplify it. The armaments on the Garde\\'s fire compressed Higgs Boson particles. The Garde\\'s engine also runs off these very same particles and if in emergency, the Garde can deploy \"sails\" to catch and story more particles.  As it turns out, the main antagonist of the show are also made primarily out of these same particles.\\nOverall, its a good show. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have been trying to get my roommate to watch it with me...and I dont even particularly like this kind of genre. 7/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1156a3e339b5c9bbf3a9af572ef55667'}>,\n",

So, I'm gonna talk about that initial experience and how I think about the series now. And, I'm gonna be casual about it.\\nSo, I first tried the sub for this show and the voices sounded so weird that it made me laugh. Then I tried the dub for this show ... and it sucked lol. So I stuck with the sub (sorry for fans of the dub, that's just my opinion). I thought the animation was a bit weird at\\nfirst, but it seemed to flow naturally for the most part. So, I didn't really mind.\\nThe setting was post-apocalyptic science fiction and not at all like most narratives from this genre. It was unique! I was eating it up! And if you don't know, the premise is of a world where horrific and powerful monsters called Gauna annihilate Earth and force humanity to evacuate on seed ships, one of which is Sidonia. Sidonia's armed forces that fight off the Gauna are comprised of giant robots that make use of a supernatural element, the Heigus Particles. It was really freaking cool.\\nThe dialogue was a bit rough here and there, but I didn't care at all. I was way too interested in the premise. The same is true for the characters. In all honesty, I have no idea how good the characters are for this series; that's how in to the premise I was.\\nAll the show had to do to hook me was show me cool science fiction stuff, and it did. I loved it. I've re-watched this show more times than I'm proud of lol. Little did I know, anime has tons of great stuff like this. And, now that I've watched tons of anime, looking back, this show ... isn't that good anymore :(.\\nThe story just seems like the writers gave up on a telling a good one at some point and started just throwing stuff into it to keep the viewers attention. It also doesn't have a convincing delivery in dialogue at times, meaning that it feels fake. It's lost the novelty that had me hooked on it when I first watched, so I can't ignore these types of things anymore. I want it to be better than it is. I want to be immersed in the show like I was, but I can't.\\nTo be fair though, the thing that hasn't eroded over time is the premise. I like the mechs and the Heigus particles, the lore and history of Sidonia, the mystery behind the Kabizashi and the Gauna, the military coordination in space battles, etc. It's just that world building doesn't mean much when the story doesn't sit right a lot of the time.\\nThis show was just right to get someone like me into anime because I wanted something more unique than everything I've seen before, but it didn't hold up to critique once I became fully invested in anime. I'm still willing to say that it's very entertaining and recommend it to others just for fun though.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4d31f15ea460cfc006006b1d14031d4b'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Sidonia no Kishi, or Knights of Sidonia, is an alternative future where mankind flees like a pussy from an ever impending extinction.\\nStraight off the bat, I would like to say that Sidonia no Kishi has a very interesting and eye-catching idea to the whole show. The way humans live in this O'Neill cylinder-ish space station and that there are many different layers of the station. Also, clouds and lakes are even included to make it seems as if it is Earth. Kinda reminds me of Made In Abyss. However, the flaws of the show are quickly revealed as the show progresses in the first few\\nepisodes. The pacing, planning of scenes and the execution of scenarios are utterly horrible and butchered. When I notice this from the get-go of the first episode, I was deeply saddened and in a state of anger and crestfallen. Anger due to them ruining such a fascinating and intriguing concept, I could really see the potential in it and was looking forward to the show as a whole. Of course, saddened by what the studio did to present this concept of Sidonia no Kishi. To be more specific, our main character, for example, Nagate, a boy that came out of the depths of the station. He has little to no knowledge of the world above and yet, in the span of the first episode, he is found by the authorities and instantly given a position at the school for pilots. This compiled with the fact that we the audience know nothing seems very rushed and out of pace. I was truly shocked by what was happening and how it happened so fast. Plus, by the next episode, our character just blends in normally like he was there begin with anyways. Additionally, how is our character not even shock to see a talking bear? Like, I was shocked and he just took it as if it were natural to see a talking bear. Talking about character issue, Norio, or the super edgy prideful piece of shit. He is painfully shallow and badly written, like, of course, there has to be that kid that wants all the spotlight to himself and proceeds to challenge  Nagate. But by challenge, I mean sabotage, and by sabotage, I mean committing an outright murder to get the spotlight. How the hell is students like him recruited in the school, I just can't fandom what the fuck he did just to get appraised. What's worse, or should I say for the better, is that he didn't have the balls to carry on his doing and loses his shit when he hears the voice of Hoshijiro. I am at least glad the show excluded him from the episodes that came after and till the end because I really do not want to see more screen time of his edgelord ass. Like, the time when he bitch slaps Izana after knocking into by accident AND she got her leg piece by a wooden stick, like, that, in bird culture, is considered a dick move. Not all is bad, thankfully, I love Izana, she is such a breath of fresh air to the horrible characters around her and Nagate got better in the later episode. What I can't stand is Kobayashi and why couldn't they pick any other name for her, I love Kobayashi for the dragon maid series. Anyway, who placed this lunatic as the head of the station. She is literally an insane person that makes, not roughness actions, but dumb and stupid ones. Like the time she engaged a turn of the station in an instant without giving time for the people to react, resulting in a ton of flying bodies splattering across the station's internal. I bet in her mind it's like 'LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR'. Plus all she does is agree at commands and disagree at some, only to bring up stupid choices. Moreover, the show does no effort in presenting time in the series. That I mean the sense of time in the show, many a time the show skipped or fast forward the scenarios that are happening, resulting in, what seemed to be a short time, happened over a long duration. The failure in doing that just makes scenes transition off and out of place. Lastly, the show does a trash job on making human pilots worthy of something, by that I mean the way the show presents the death of pilots on every mission doesn't seem impactfully enough and that just resembles disposable underwear to me. You have to be kidding, how did the 4, star pilots train hard and well for an attack and instantly got rekted in the first battle without putting much of a fight. Truly, that is so disappointing to see.\\n-SCORES-\\nCharacter- 5/10: Love Izana, Hoshijiro (even her placenta form), the last half of Nagate and of course, Lala. The rest of the characters just seemed too shallow and weak, and Kobayashi is just a lunatic.\\nArt- 8/10: I honestly think they did a great job on the art, I absolutely adore the half-time art scenes of episodes, probably from the manga but those are gorgeous to me. Other than the times when scenes are too bright and that their clothing is always dirty, I say the style they made on was pretty and decent. Nowhere close the studio Orange standard of 3D but still a decent one.\\nWriting- 4/10: Planning, pacing, storyboard, character-wise, execution, dialog, and some others are weak. I disapprove of the implementation of Slice Of Life and Romance genre at first, but after seeing countless 'Sortie Alert', I just want them to continue the path of the world around them in the station and not what is going on outside. The 'Sortie Alert' is probably used too many times, I sigh whenever something interesting is happening and then,' Sortie Alert' appears. For Nagate, it's back to sorties for you.\\nSound- 7/10: The did a decent job, the intro is nice by everything seems kinda flushed out. Like I just want to enjoy it at max but the studio probably forgot to increase the volume of the intro in production.\\nOverall, please for the love, please get better in the next season. I really love the concept but hate the studio for presenting it in such a shit manner.\\nStrong 4 to a Light 5\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c8960698312d69f85043a447352efaec'}>,\n",

It presents itself as a more realistic version of mechs in space, which is potentially appealing, but more ‘realistic’ seems to mean that it just drops the insane action sequences that makes mech shows so absurd/fun in the first place. And in its place they put... nothing. Nothing at all. The show feels like an empty shell.\\nIt’s not like there’s nothing positive to be said about the series. The starfighter squad sometimes works in a vaguely Battlestar Galactica way. By toning down the extreme personalities they provide an opportunity for a more serious look\\nat what life as a combat squad is like. In space. But like so many of their good ideas they just waste it. In fact, I’m going to list all the good (or at least potentially good/interesting) ideas and what they do with them:\\nHumans have been engineered to survive mainly on photosynthesis.\\nUsed to make Toyosaki’s nonphotosynthetic eating habits stand out. And nothing else.\\nDead people are recycled for... nutrients I guess?\\nToyosaki’s  vaguely scared by the idea.\\nThe ship’s acceleration requires people to hook onto walls or be thrown to their deaths.\\nWe do actually get a pretty cool action scene out of this.\\nThere’s an entire ocean above them.\\nThey use it to go on dates. And nothing else.\\nThere is a third gender now.\\nGoes absolutely nowhere. Not even a romance really.\\nIt’s not a show devoid of ideas, just one that goes nowhere with them.\\nThe animation is weird and takes a biit of getting used to. It basically looks like a JRPG, with digital characters being manipulated to act out scenes. I suppose it saves them the money they’d have to use to correct these designs digitally, but it does look odd. Characters look identical as part of the efforts at “realism”. Everyone has black hair and a typical anime face. Except the villain and one random girl. Honestly, I can only tell the two main girls (or rather one girl and one third gender) apart by the size of their breasts. It’s that bad.\\nThe plot is typical mech stuff. An evil alien race destroyed Earth and is now chasing the surviving ships. Sidonia is one of those ships and the inhabitants have found a way to kill the enemy using mechs armed with a rare type of metal. The fight scenes are brief and basic. Extreme fight mechanics have been erased. This means that there’s never any real thrill to the battles. Sometimes this approach leads to interesting ideas, like an entire episode spent trapped in space in a powerless mech. More often it just means interminable dialogue that establishes nothing.\\nI dunno. I wanted to like this but I couldn’t even make it through the first season. It just didn’t have any substance.

Sidonia have very twisted ending ever, Omg it hurt so much!, From the beginning i thought Sidonia maybe go harem end or at least emotionless Hoshijiro is better than this...Sigh.

But Sidonia good at emotionlize characters mood, feeling and sensation and nothing much to say.\\nSound (7/10):\\nThe overall sound is good for my taste, myself didn\\'t really care bout sound. The voice acting is good, engine sound is good, combat sound is good, eating sound didn\\'t catch my attention, environment sound didn\\'t catch my attention when at the outer wall that place is high its must sound like remote, deserted out of normal life, the sound of wind, the echo from vast and enormous at high like inside Sidonia\\'s tummy.

My fav scene is Placenta Hoshijiro lips attack Nagate.\\nCharacter (7/10):\\nGood but somewhat not good at all. Characters heavily depend on story development like every product out there and their fate belong to their creator. How this character appear, how they talk, interact, love and most importantly Disappear. Can\\'t you feel some interested characters have some amusing history, background about how they are, where they from, how this person became the person they stand before viewer eye now and \"Ill Fate is the meaning\" they evaporated so fast, for example Izana and Hoshijiro of the future completely faint and hazy fate.\\nOf course most of them(even ur beloved waifu) will die like every characters in Mecha genre \"Bubble is the meaning\".

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Title: The Vision of Escaflowne\\nManga, Anime: There are three different manga for this anime, and the two that were released around the same time as the anime are worlds apart.  In order to understand this, you need to know a little something about the production.\\nEscaflowne was in development for about five years.  Shoji Kawamori (famous for his work on the Macross series and Eureka Seven) came up with the initial idea for the series after a trip to Nepal, and hashed out the basics of the series with Minoru Takanashi at Bandai, with Hitomi originally as a curvy, long-haired, air-headed girl with glasses,\\nand a decidedly more shonen bent to the series.  Sunrise (famous for their work on the Gundam series and Cowboy Bebop) was originally selected to do the series, which was then planned at 39 episodes, and Noboteru Yuki worked with Kawamori, with the director at the time being Yasuhiro Imagawa.  The director stuck around long enough to coin the phrase Escaflowne, and then left before production actually started, and the project was shelved.  Two years later, Sunrise picked it back up and bought on Kazuki Akane (famous for his work on Noein -To Your Other Self- and the Birdy the Mighty 2008 remake), who then gave the series a complete makeover, bringing in shoujo elements to balance out the shonen, notably, making the men a bit more into bishonen and remaking Hitomi as the girl we know in the series.\\nThe first of the manga titles to come out shared the anime's name, and was based on the original production ideas, which gave it far more of a shonen bent.  This manga was done by Katsu Aki, and ran in Kadokawa Shoten's Shonen Ace magazine from October 24th, 1994 to November 26th, 1997.  It was licensed Stateside by Tokyopop, and the eighth and final volume was released on September 14th, 2004.  The second manga title, titled Messaiah Knight - The Vision of Escaflowne, later retitled Hitomi - The Vision of Escaflowne, was released around the same time as the anime, and was a shoujo adaptation based more on the final version of the anime.  Yuzuru Yashiro did this adaptation, and it ran in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX magazine from April 8th, 1996 to January 18th, 1997, and has yet to be licensed Stateside.  The final manga title is called Energist's Memories, which is an anthology of several stories from the Escaflowne universe done by several manga authors.  It was released in January of 1997, and also has yet to be licensed Stateside.\\nEscaflowne is a twenty-six episode series (yes, you'll notice it was cut down from the 39 episodes originally planned) that was produced by Sunrise and Bandai Visual, and directed by Kazuki Akane.  It ran on Japanese TV from April 2nd, 1996 till September 24th, 1996.  It was licensed Stateside by Bandai Entertainment, and the latest full boxset was released on April 11th, 2006 as part of the Anime Legends collection.\\nStory: High school track runner Hitomi Kanzaki has a talent for stunningly accurate tarot readings.  One day, she has a vision of a young man slaying a dragon, and, later that night, the same young man is transported to her world in a pillar of light, along with the dragon, and he slays it.  As soon as the young man, named Van Fanel, has harvested the energist stone that lies in the dragon, the pillar of light returns him back to his world, Gaea, where both the moon and Earth (known as the Mystic Moon) hang in the sky - only Hitomi is taken back with him.  As Hitomi tries to find a way home, her latent psychic powers are awakened, which in turn awakens Farnelia's mech (known as Escaflowne), and she becomes caught up in the politics and conflict between Asturia, Farnelia, and the Zaibach Empires.\\nYou can tell that the story was originally meant for a longer series, but the decision to trim it down to twenty-six episodes came through just when the series came in just as production was beginning, and the director didn't want to sacrifice any of the characters or plot lines.  So, instead, the already elaborately planned plotlines and character development was made to fit into a twenty-six episode series.  And, admittedly, while the story and development is a bit jerky, slow at first but then speeding up in others, it still manages to completely and coherently wrap things up in its length, not to mention give the fairly extensive cast of characters good development.\\nAnd speaking of characters, I have so much respect for how they developed them.  The characters all start out as fairly common shoujo tropes, but are developed into real people and incredibly engaging ones at that.  Hitomi especially; she could've been this horrible Mary-Sue, but instead she is developed and even grows up a little as she makes her way through Gaea and reacts pretty realistically to her situation.  Relationships between all of them are slowly developed, and you aren't hit over the head with it as they are; when they are finally bought to light or out and out pointed out, you realize, &quot;Oh, that explains it!&quot;\\nFor those of you who are mech fans, you'll be happy to hear that the mech fights are paid as much attention to as the the story and character development; there's at least one major fight every other episode.  And especially appropriate is how they developed the mechs to match the level of technology that's found in Gaea.\\nGaea is general is built extremely well as a world; just about every aspect you could think of is given thought and explained in ways that don't make you feel like you're being hit over the head with the exposition hammer all that much.\\nThe downside of all this is that you feel like you're getting bombarded with information, and there are a few minor characters that are mostly running gags and who they seem to forget exist for a few episodes here and there and then are bought back into the story to remind the audience, &quot;Hey!  They're still here!&quot;\\nSo, overall, while there is quite an overload on information, and a few gag characters are forgotten here and there, Escaflowne's story is still pretty good, and all elements of it are given equal loving attention.\\nArt: Compared to other shows that were airing roughly around this time (Ruroni Kenshin, Martian Successor Nadesico, Ghost in the Shell), Escaflowne's art is pretty damn good, if not gorgeous.  Character designs are given the perfect amount of detail, not to mention as are all the different races on Gaea, mech designs, backgrounds, just everything is absolutely beautiful in this.  There are some very strong lines used in this, like what we saw in Ouran High School Host Club.   And overall, the quality of the art has aged quite well.\\nThe style of the art has not aged well, though.  Facial features are extremely exaggerated, notably with a few noses that could conceivably be used as swords with how pointy they are.  Also, CG use in this is fairly obvious, which is a bit understandable, but it's still a bit painful to watch at times.\\nMusic: The music for this is absolutely spectacular.  Yoko Kanno did the work on this, and it's not the typical jazz soundtrack that I've seen from her in Darker than Black and Cowboy Bebop.  Instead, here, we get EPIC orchestral scores, with beautiful string work and special emphasis on the cello (used to be a cellist, so it's always great for me to hear the instrument used so well) and excellent choral arrangements.\\nThe OP is sung by Maaya Sakamoto, Hitomi's seiyuu, and is just a lovely ballad (well, waltz, actually, it is in 3/4 time) in general.  It's always a good thing when I don't skip through the OP, and it's even better when I sing along to it; I did this every episode.  The ED is a more stereotypical upbeat JPop number done by a guy instead of a girl, and was very easily skippable.\\nSeiyuu: This series is chock full of good seiyuu.  Hitomi was Maaya Sakamoto's (famous for her work as Haruhi in Ouran High School Host Club and Aeris Gainsborough in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children) debut role, and her singing of the OP was her first work singing.  Besides Ms. Sakamoto,  Jouji Nakata (famous for his roles as the Count in Gankutsuou and Alucard in Hellsing) appears as Folken, and Juurouta Kosugi (famous for his roles as Akio in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Fernand d'Morcerf in Gankutsuou) appears as Dryden.\\nAs for the other seiyuu, the voices fit well, and were acted well, which is all I ask for.\\nLength: Twenty-six episodes makes the series feel a bit pushed for time.  Having the full run of 39 episodes probably would have helped this in the long run, and especially given it some time to breathe.  Any shorter, though, and it just wouldn't have worked.\\nOverall: Escaflowne has an excellent story and characters, a well-built and animated world, excellent seiyuu and beautiful music.  It has a few flaws, mainly from the compressed schedule it was given to air in, and the occasional forgetting of characters but, nonetheless, is a very solid series.  It's not a ZOMG favorite series for me, but I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good series.\\nStory: 9/10\\nArt: 7/10\\nMusic: 9/10\\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\nLength: 7/10\\nOverall: 41/50; 82% (B)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '61671ba3ee6a2bd2c49fade03c77386f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Oh Escaflowne, I do love thee. This is my favorite series to date and is likely to stay that way, but what makes it so appealing?\\nThe first thing about this series that earned it a point in my favor was the wholeness and realness of the characters. Hitomi, the protagonist, in particular earned my approval because she, unlike most anime females, seems very realistic. She's not the stereotypical &quot;cutesy&quot; girl (God, but I do hate those), nor is she overly self-sacrificing; she's not one of those violence prone angry chicks, nor is she the tough loner, she's not a goober who's always eating, nor is\\nshe a femme fatale; she's just a high school girl growing up in stages with a strong moral code. She's someone I can imagine meeting if I walk down the street, which, after being innundated with the above stereotypical anime females, is very refreshing. Granted, there are many people who dislike Hitomi greatly, but I feel that she's a strong character and that many of her actions, if you take the time to really imagine yourself in her situation, are reasonable, or at the least, understandable.\\nAside form Hitomi, there are many other chracters involved in the story, each having their own personalities and unique stories. You've got Allen, the valiet bishounen knight, who is a bit strung up on the old ways of chivalry, Dilandau, the bloodthirsty psychopathic young general, Van, the moody and quiet crown prince, and a variety of other characters. The characters are so well done that it's easy to fall in love with even the minor ones such as Gaddes, Allen's right hand man.\\nThe art style is very good given it's time period. It is a bit older though, so don't expect graphics like those of today found in animes such as Full Metal Alchemist and Air. The colors are a bit duller, but that only serves to enhance the overall rustic feeling of the anime.\\nThe musical score for the series is fantastic. The emotions of a scene are captured superbly based solely on the ochestra rhythms. The openning theme is one of my favorites. The ending is a bit odd, but it grows on you. The ending also seems somewhat out of place as it has a sort of slowish techno-pop feel to it.\\nThe main genres are romance and fantasy, but there is also a splash of the mecha realm thrown in. Unlike most mecha animes, the mechs in this are powered by the fantastical powers of dragon heart stones, hydrolics, and mechanical sytems. Their subesquent design is unique and intruiging. While seemingly low tech (the world in which Hitomi falls is not really technologically advanced and has a middle ages feel to it), the mechs are actually impressive bits of machinary. The floating fortresses and air ships, powered by magical stones, are also of interest.\\nThere is not much humor to be found. Given that the story takes place in a world in the thros of war, this is understanable. It is not overwhelmingly, depressingly serious though. They do not make a point of expressing the darkest vices of human nature like Beserk or Elfen Lied. However, the anime does examine the destructiveness of greed, cowardess, hatred, and the problems associated with pursuing science for the sake of science. So, if you're a fan of the overly goofy or light-hearted series, this one is likely not for you. It is also not likely for you if you're an action fiend that requires an explosion or hand-to-hand fight every ten seconds. This one is mainly for fantasy/romance (but not the teenaged angst romance or the ten girls single guy romance) types.\\nOne of the main themes of the anime is the conflict of fate versus free will. It makes some very intersting conclusions about how one's free will affects not only one's self but all of those around one.\\nI adored the bizarre twists presented at the end and highly recommend this. At least watch the first three or four episodes to give it a try. The only thing that will disappoint you is the fact that there's not more of it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1221cb2983b54194e66dbc062ddd6ea8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '*Contains Heavy Spoilers*\\nSo I\\'ve been patiently watching the series mainly because I have nothing else to do, and tbh I quite enjoyed the first half of the series. And then they lost me. I mean it\\'s a fantasy anime, so a fair bit of leeway has to be given to the plot. I can make my peace with the hidden power of fate that the MC uses. I can deal with the mana-mechanical transformer-bots in a medieval setting. Hell, I can even swallow the uber ridiculous goal of the antagonist to control fate, and in corollary, control the world. Classic Villain. Pretty easy to swallow.\\nThen it got weird.\\nThere are a bunch of reasons I pretty much hated the series.\\n1. The antagonists are a fucking joke. First there\\'s Dornkirk who is our classic villain in the shadows, pulling the strings, laughing his evil laugh, who not surprisingly at all started out helping people. His goal is to create a world without war. Now thats very ambitious. More ambitious is his chosen method of accomplishing this goal i.e. controlling fate. You would think that he would take some kind of care in choosing his generals and inner circle.\\nWhich brings me to Folken. Seriously dude? You joined his Hitler-esque cause because you didn\\'t want to kill a dragon? Yeah I know, thats not what happened, but take a moment to think about his actual motivation for joining up with Dornkirk. There really isn\\'t any. I mean I get why the fortune twins fell for Folken, they were half cat so it makes sense for them to unconditionally love the person who saved them. Folken\\'s origin story makes me believe his Draconian mother had intimate relations with a fucking cocker spaniel, because in the end he\\'s basically a rescue.\\nAND WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THIS DILANDAU CHARACTER? I mean seriously. His only motivation to do anything is \"I have a boo boo on my cheek and I must destroy the one who did it and anyone in the way of accomplishing my boo boo revenge\". Really man? Is that all there is to you considering how many fucking times you battled the MC?\\n2. Which brings me to my second point. I don\\'t like to be masturbated without the pleasure of a climax. Van has a hard-on for murdering every minor baddie, but for whatever reason when it comes to Dilandau his sword needs Viagra to function. Not to mention Hitomi\\'s nagging also starts ONLY when Dilandau\\'s close to death. Why? Why is this barely one dimensional character still alive in the 3rd act of the series? Even the final plot twist with this character...WHY? And more importantly HOW? His condition just resolves itself because….profit? This character gave me the biggest murder boner simply because the writers wouldn\\'t kill the little bitch off and kept teasing till the very end.\\nAnd after all that \"cold as ice\" acting , Folken\\'s heart suddenly melts? Because his two pussy cats died? Why? Did I miss something? What was your motivation to join Dornkirk ? What was your motivation in leaving him? Were you sleeping while he slaughtered the first few million people, or did it really take your pussy dying for you to regain your empathy? WTF? THIS, if any of the characters from the antagonists should have been the final conflict. Instead, the writers pussy out and turn him into a good guy at the end. Its pathetic. I bet a nun could jerk me off better than this piece of shit anime.\\n3. Then there’s… Luck enhanced soldiers made by transfusing synthetic blood created from splicing the genes of the luckiest people…….\\nARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?!? WHY NOT A FUCKING SPELL? ITS A MAGICAL WORLD!!! A SPELL WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE BELIEVABLE!!!\\nUnless you’re as nit picky as me, you probably won\\'t notice, but the mythology and the world design is in a clash in this anime. Much of it is ok, since we waste most of our time with the bland and often interchangeable characters, but for the most part...ehhh...the world isn\\'t believable as either fantasy or science fiction.\\n4. The two main characters finally fall in love. This love is strong. Its history is epic. It will become a tale retold in many forms. It had the power to overcome fate. There was nothing in the way of the two lovers making a life together. Theirs was a perfect ending. “Well, I have go back to Earth for absolutely no reason at all and pine for my lover for the rest of my life” - Hitomi.\\nStupid bitch.\\nIn conclusion, I’ve definitely seen animes with worse characters, story mechanics, mythology and plot. Credit where credit’s due. It isnt the worst thing out there, but make sure you don\\'t watch this anime when you actually have the time to watch it. Watch it while you study for a test or something like that. Keep it in the background so you don\\'t notice the flaws, and you only see the magical transformer robots and furries. At least that way you won\\'t pull your hair out from the frustrating stupidity that is Escaflowne.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4646082a712cf5e9dd6b363dca81e546'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Escaflowne is renowned for its soundtrack scored by Yoko Kanno, an epic orchestral voyage to a fantasy land that remains original even today in an era overrun by music for fantasy films and anime, all vaguely familiar with their typical motifs and themes.\\nEscaflowne’s animation, at least for the remastered DVDs should also be praised, as well as the direction by Kazuki Akane.  It’s dynamic, artistic and looks gorgeous; a vivid world brought to life by an excellent production staff.\\nEscaflowne’s story takes a dump on all of this, squatting on its nonexistent bent knees, its jeans wrapped around its feet awkwardly, while it looks around\\nwithout any shame whatsoever, even with an air of arrogance about it, staring at you as if to say “Yeah?  So what?”\\nA schoolgirl, Hitomi, gets transported to another world which is on the brink of war thanks to an empire ruled by a beardy man with plans to change fate to his whim.  There is a supporting cast of kings, princes and princesses, random animal-folk, jousting mecha and an obligatory secondary antagonist who is bug-eyed, sounds like a little girl when in pain and generally annoys the hell out of you, much like when you see someone taking a dump in public with no shame.\\nThe writer, the aforementioned dump-taker, takes the concept of fate and rapes it to a bloody pulp with deus ex machina after deus ex machina.  What we see is not so much the consequences of toying with fate, as the big baddie attempts to do, but the consequences of a lousy writer using fate as an excuse to take shortcuts in the screenplay because he's too lazy and incompetent to tell a tale properly.\\nEscaflowne has a pretty simple, and almost childish, story structure of groups of people being chased from one action scene to another, complimented by a love triangle, which all builds up into a perfect storm of plot contrivances, holes, twists and gaps of logic, all meaningless, un-earned and insulting.\\nThe writer plays so fast and loose with Hitomi's powers that anything can happen at any time and there's nothing you can do about it, the writer just doesn’t care about any rules of screenwriting, he throws everything at the screen and the viewer has to accept it or not, no matter how baffling and unexplained it is.\\nPeople getting transported via columns of light into specific landscapes very conveniently, people having their flashbacks played for others, people getting hurt or healed conveniently, in fact it may as well have been called the Convenient Vision of Escaflowne, because Hitomi sure as hell gets many during the series, all perfectly timed to diffuse the story of any sense of mystery, suspense and development.\\nEvery single dramatic action scene of importance is foreshadowed and foreseen by the protagonist, and thus the viewer.  To have a 26 episode series constantly use this method is staggering in its ineptitude, and almost irresponsible behaviour that any writer worth his salt would balk at.\\nThis 'character' of Hitomi feels and sees EVERYTHING that happens in the story, all to the writer's convenience.  She's not so much a 'god' as she is the writer's pen masturbating over your eyeballs.\\nNearly every rule, whether it be mythological or narrative-based, set up in the story is either broken, molested or outright ignored just to give maximum dramatic impact, but that impact itself is robbed of any power because it’s so insulting watching a story be so inconsistent.\\nLazy writing.  This, as you can guess by now, was the main problem of the series.  Characters acting out of character, revelations with no meaning or coherence about them, it’s a mess.  A mess strung together by an extremely competent crew, the writer notwithstanding.  A brilliantly directed and animated mess with a gorgeous soundtrack.\\nYoko Kanno’s 4 CD soundtrack is a classic of the anime medium.  An amazingly sumptuous memorable epic filled with orchestral bombast, vocal choirs scaring the crap out of you with chants of ‘ESCAFLOWNE’, beautiful violin and piano-led melodies that indicate a winding journey of heroism and love.   Basically her soundtrack doesn’t belong on such a flawed story, and as a result it elevates the anime to another level.  It keeps you watching even though the story irritates you with its constant missteps, the music is too beautiful to ignore.\\nThere are memorable moments in Escaflowne, thanks to the music, art and direction, making it worth a watch but not essential.  Listening to the soundtrack is a must however.  Having visuals as a context may enhance your experience with Kanno’s genius, but she is so skilled that you don’t need the images of this anime to be affected by her music.\\nIf you want to watch a tale with the same template but done better, then watch Juuni Kokuki.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3b9b2c24d107a1c25313c345506a5ef5'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Escaflowne is an anime is about a high school girl Hitomi, who is one of the best runners in her school. She also has a gift in fortunetelling and she has a vision of having a weird encounter with a mysterious knight. Then one fateful day this vision becomes a reality when she has a deadly encounter with that knight. If things weren&rsquo;t strange enough, Hitomi and the knight were suddenly transported back to his world.\\nI know what most anime fans are wondering, hasn&rsquo;t this whole other world thing been done before, but this sort of has an original feel to it. Yet another romantic,\\nfantasy, mecha, anime but with a medieval theme, which really hasn&rsquo;t been done before (or hasn&rsquo;t been done this well). The story basically follows and the knight&rsquo;s (known as Van) adventure. A lot of intense and shocking stuff happens before this, but I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the surprise. During these adventures Hitomi&rsquo;s and Van&rsquo;s relationship slowly develops, however the main focus of the show is usually taken away from them and that helps to make it less obvious. The story flows well right to the end, thanks to the well thought out plot and definitely has plenty of action and suspense to spice things up.\\nThis is a mecha anime so the predominant amount of mecha combat is an issue. Even though the mechas (known as Guymelef&rsquo;s) design was different than usual, with no modern technology but purely age old magic and mechanism, it somehow worked well with the medieval theme. The way the mechas moved and fought was unique, which made the combat fluid and superb to watch, most of the time.\\nThe characters were interesting and as the story went by more secrets were revealed. Although the characters were good, the dialogue sometimes wasn&rsquo;t. It felt unoriginal and at times it made the characters, mostly the girls, very annoying to listen to.\\nEven though Escaflowne is sort of an old anime, the animation was great and I felt as though the animators put a lot of effort into it. The audio was both good and bad. What made it really good was the excellently composed soundtrack, which blended well with the theme and situations. On the other hand, what made it bad was the terrible sound quality, maybe it was the version I got, but it made the dialogue even worse.\\nTo summarize, this was an interesting anime to watch, with a well thought out plot and good storyline. It started of as an empty jigsaw but as the story went on, it revealed interesting pieces to fill in the jigsaw and at a pace I was satisfied with. Although 2 / 3rd into the show, it starts to lose its pace as it starts to randomly add in new issues like fate, destiny, luck, etc. At this point the episodes slowly started to become less exciting to watch and more of a chore. However this didn&rsquo;t stop it from having a great ending with the inevitable battle and confession. I recommend this to anyone who&rsquo;s interested in their mecha, romance or is a snuff maniac and likes to see a lot of people die.\\n^_^', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '76ca9642249e642f695f32b80e93fa3d'}>,\n",

After all, the first time I watched it was almost 9 years ago, and I didn&rsquo;t think it was that bad when I first saw it. I wasn&rsquo;t able to finish it then so I decided to finish it now.\\nThe story is actually good. Another teenager sucked into an entirely new world. Teenager wants to go home, but somehow forgets about that when she realizes she needs to help out the\\npeople of the new world she&rsquo;s in. It&rsquo;s clich&eacute;, I know, but Escaflowne&rsquo;s story line is way more developed and well thought of than other series with a similar storyline. It is way more complicated than that, in fact, it was too complicated for me that sometimes, I don&rsquo;t understand it all. Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t listening well enough, but since this has happened before, I&rsquo;m just gonna say I&rsquo;m slow when it comes to some anime.\\nI like the theme of fate and destiny, and how you can direct it to go your way. This principle is actually applicable to life, isn&rsquo;t it? Then we look into the ugly side of people &ndash; how selfish some of us can be, and how war ruins the way life goes. Makes for a good story, but I wasn&rsquo;t that impressed. It&rsquo;s mostly because it was a bit too serious for me. You don&rsquo;t see Hitomi or Van going chibi not even once. There were some funny and cutesy parts, but not enough for me to say that the series is good at least for a few laughs.\\nThe pacing was good, though. It wasn&rsquo;t unnecessarily long, and that may be the only good side of being a no nonsense anime for me. Thank goodness it wasn&rsquo;t longer than 26 episodes, as I&rsquo;ve said it was almost like a drag to finish it. I wouldn&rsquo;t have finished it if it were 120-episodes long.\\nThe character design wasn&rsquo;t bad. I like almost everyone, and when I say almost everyone, I meant I like everyone except Hitomi. I know she&rsquo;s the main character, but she didn&rsquo;t interest me at all. She&rsquo;s so bland looking, and a bit annoying. Maybe it&rsquo;s the terrible voice acting (I watched the one with the English dub) but I can&rsquo;t say I like her. I do like Allen and Van, especially Allen. Allen is so handsome. Of course he is a bishonen, but he isn&rsquo;t feminine or narcissistic at all, which makes me like him more. Van is a bit more boyish, but he isn&rsquo;t that bad looking either. Speaking of Allen and Van, why the heck are they fighting over Hitomi anyway? She&rsquo;s not that pretty at all! I can understand if Van liked Hitomi, since they&rsquo;re in the same age group but with Allen? I don&rsquo;t think so.\\nIn general, it was a well drawn anime, considering it was made in the mid &ndash; 90s. I would like to think of it as medieval Gundam. I like how the scenes were designed, there were really good landscapes. The clothes were kinda weird, but then again, weird clothes aren&rsquo;t a rare occurrence in anime world. There were times when the characters would morph, but it&rsquo;s just a teensy &ndash; weensy problem that can be overlooked.\\nThe best thing I liked about this anime is the music. Yoko Kanno did a really good job, and most of the time when the scenes got dull and I would almost fall asleep, her fantastic music comes up and I&rsquo;m back to watching it seriously again. I didn&rsquo;t know who Yoko Kanno was before watching this anime, and I would always wonder why people talk about her work a lot. Now I know.\\nOver all, I would say that this is an excellent anime. Even though I didn&rsquo;t like it that much, it still had the makings of a really good anime.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Escaflowne is in the same generation as other venerated anime titles often fondly reminisced upon by fans, kenshin, trigun, cowboy bebop, and fushigi yugi.  Where those titles all had specific target audiences, Escaflowne goes broader, not by distinguishing itself from any set Anime genre, but mixing the staples, or cliché’s of several genres together.  Nothing about Escaflowne is very impressive at first.  The juxtaposition of a Shoujo cast of main characters and mecha/fantasy war at its bloodiest is novel, but neither individual elements are even close to out of the ordinary.  Hitomi, the main character is an understandably reluctant heroin who\\nalso has, as high school kids often do, a romantic interest that is easily piqued.  The 2 male protagonists are opposites.  1 is a smooth player, the other a brash but innocent young man.  There is a rather typical demented and obsessive villain, who is kept in check by another level headed villain.  The characters are certainly not unique, but to be fair in this regard, how many anime characters are?  Evengelion aside, I can’t think of another vaguely popular anime of a similar genre that could boast of a cast that is much fresher.\\nStory/Characters:\\nThe strength of Escaflowne, and the greatest reason why this is one of my all time favorite anime’s despite how I may have more praises for other titles on paper, is the story.  Escaflowne’s story is masterfully paced, rivaled (but definitely not surpassed) only by full metal alchemist in this regard in 13+ episode series’.  The number of fillers are often a measure of the tightness in a story, but in Escaflowne’s case, it’d be hard enough to find a filler scene, let alone a filler episode.  The story keeps you engrossed in the central plot at all times, never taking a break from it in favor of developing a character’s past with flash backs or developing a relationship with a side plot.  There are flashbacks, and there is plenty of relationship development, but it’s always directly related to the events of the story.  The plot cleverly weaves the situations of all the characters, heroes and villains together in a way that when we learn of the past of one character, it always ties into at least one other character, and the bigger picture.  The imposing empire has a weapon that doesn’t quite control, but can affect fate, which results basically in altered luck.  Because our heroin has the unique ability to predict the future, which fixes fate, her mental state is directly related to the effectiveness of the empire’s military.  Psychological warfare of all sorts, including romance, is employed against her so that she can’t, or won’t use her ability.  Her relationships are therefore always in the center of the story, thus the 2 contradictory elements of its concept, a shoujo cast dealing with love triangles and teenage angst, combines seamlessly with the war setting.  Escaflowne plays like a very long movie, and you can easily lose track of how many episodes you have watched in one sitting, but individual episodes retain endings, save for 1 or 2 exceptions, that break at logical points in the story, where there is some resolution along with the cliffhangers.  How the story could be so perfectly structured, fluid yet broken into 26 pieces, is beyond me.\\nThe relationships in this series develop so many nuances that the characters transcend how emotionally effective their archetypes may be in any other series’.  While the main characters have personalities that are indistinguishable from their mirrors in the same genre, the genuine way they express certain emotions make them uniquely effective despite their clichés.  The jealousy expressed is as it is in reality, bitter and painful, where the love and the hate for one person creates utter confusion in the characters’ minds.  Love and romance is also distinguished finely, where one is affection pure and sweet, the other is a mélange of one liners, swooning, and loads of baggage.  While the central theme of the nature of fate, and mankind’s destiny of bloodshed is vaguely interesting, what truly inspires reflection is how real the relationships between some of these characters feel.\\nHitomi is also my favorite shoujo/josei oriented protagonist.  They are so often resolved simpletons with near unbreakable wills, but where’s the drama in that?  Hitomi is the exact opposite, she is a little moody, indecisive, and usually feint of heart.  It’s obvious which mirrors a real high school girl more closely, but that aside, her character gives rise to all kinds of conflicts and makes those instances where she manages to collect herself more inspiring as the accomplishment and the courage is truly highlighted next to her usual, very human cowardice and reluctance.  For a main character in a story that centers around villains trying to break her will, a weak, flawed character is perfect.\\nSound:\\nThe orchestral score is with good reason one of the most admired sound tracks in Anime.  It is absolutely riveting, feature film level in its quality and variety.  Instead of many plays on a couple of melodies that most soundtracks use, all the tracks in Escaflowne are unique, ranging from warm unaccompanied strings to a chorus belting menacing tunes that bring to mind apocalyptic images.  Soundtracks as comprehensive and expansive as Escaflowne’s no longer exist in TV series’.  The opening and endings don’t get nearly as much love, but they are excellent fits for the series.  Each reflects the essence of a character and highlights the themes of the series so fittingly that by the end, listening to it will conjure up the emotionally impacting scenes of its climax once again.  What more can you ask for in an opening or ending?\\nAnimation:\\nThe character designs take a few episodes to get used to, but a more objective look at the animation quality in terms of fluidity will show Escaflowne as an above average, bordering on excellent title, and animation quality always ages well.  Raw production value that yields more detailed, human looking animations and more frames will result in smoother, prettier animation.  Advancements in technology don’t significantly change that fact.  Just look at the scene where snow white dances with the dwarves in the classic Disney movie.  A newer movie like Mulan can’t come close to its humanness in any scene.  The color scheme of escaflowne is not as neon-y bright as many modern titles, but there are no fair standards of evaluation in that department since that is as subjective as color preference.\\n---\\nEscaflowne is one of my favorite pieces of entertainment, up there with some of my most beloved movies and books.  The telling of this story is truly artistic, and nothing since has measured up, but its overall excellence is also due to the raw emotional value of the complex relationships these characters build and some of their true-to-life expressions of emotions that are rarely seen in Anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3649cf1fdeaacc860b0fc50885c4adb6'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Vision of Escaflowne has something of a name for itself in anime history for being an an attempt to appeal to both shonen and shoujo demographics at the same time. Featuring mechas, swordfights, explosions, stuff burning etc. alongside bishonen male protagonists in a love triangle with the regular everyday girl from another world seems to be a lot of its selling point, and as a result, it\\'s often fondly remembered as a true anime classic of the 90s.\\nEscaflowne revolves around a teenage girl named Hitomi Kanzaki, an everyday ordinary girl who happens to like reading tarot cards. Or so that was the extent of it,\\nuntil one day, she ended up being whisked away to the mysterious world of Gaia with a dragon-slaying teenage boy who was returning. As it turns out, Hitomi has ended up in the midst of a world about to break into full-blown war, as a result of the strange actions of the nation of Zaibach.\\nThe first, and most obvious problem, as you may have already guessed from the synopsis, is our main character Hitomi. She is basically just what you would expect from what has been said... a bland, overly moral cliché, existing mainly for the female side of the audience to project themselves onto, as she is paired up with both of our handsome bishonen leads. And unfortunately, they aren\\'t anything impressive either. Van Fanel is an angsty prince who sees his kingdom destroyed at the start of the series, and if you just noticed the clichés rack up, you\\'re not the only one. He also happens to be the one that Hitomi will obviously get paired with by the end of the series. He is balanced out by Allen, who happens to be a charming, charismatic ladykiller who excels in basically every field he participates in. He had the most potential of the three, but by the end of it he\\'s honestly not all that interesting. Throw into this a number of annoying supporting characters (along with one who happens to be pretty awesome), and you have a relatively poor set of protagonists.\\nHowever, this is mostly where the bad in Escaflowne ends. The plot in Escaflowne manages to be very solid, enough so to balance out the poor leading cast. The directing is even better, building some excellent scenes with solid action, mostly revolving around the mechas (referred to as Guymelefs). When talking of Escaflowne, you will probably end up hearing a fair bit about the Guymelefs, and with good reason. The steampunk design that they use makes them an excellent contribution to the mecha genre. In fact, the steampunk vibe in general is probably one of the most solid things about Escaflowne.\\nOn top of this, while the protagonists are rather underwhelming, the antagonists certainly fare better. Dornkirk, Folken, and Dillandau are a far better trio than Hitomi, Van and Allen, with the latter being quite firmly the most memorable character in the series due to being batshit insane. Folken is Van\\'s brother, and has more than a handful of similarities to a certain Star Wars character (I won\\'t say who, but you can probably guess) and I mean that as a compliment. And Dornkirk, the Big Bad, does sit back for most of the series, but can be rather menacing when he is directly involved, and provides some very interesting motives.\\nFrom a production angle of things, Escaflowne was excellent for its time, and in technical terms it\\'s still very solid, but unfortunately the art and animation have aged quite a lot. Most notably in the case of the infamous CG dragons. The character designs are clearly the thing that have aged the worst, though. Saucer-like eyes and misshapen noses are everywhere in them. The soundtrack is by Yoko Kanno, so odds are I don\\'t really need to say anything else because it\\'s freaking Yoko Kanno. The voice acting in the original Japanese is also excellent, with Maaya Sakamoto providing her debut role as Hitomi, and Minami Takayama gives a standout performance as Dilandau. Unfortunately, the dub does not even come close to shaping up. None of the actors involved really seem to grasp the concept of \"acting\", nor do any of them sound remotely convincing in their given roles.\\nOverall, Escaflowne is definitely an enjoyable run, but I really can\\'t see where it gets its status as a classic from. It\\'s far too flawed to be deserving of a 16-year legacy, nor has it really contributed anything good to anime as a medium. Nonetheless, it\\'s still quite a solid story if you can get past the main characters.\\nFinal words: Overrated, but still quite good.\\nStory/Plot: 8/10\\nAnimation/Graphics: 7/10\\nMusic/Background: 9/10\\nCharacters: 6/10\\nEnglish Dub: 2/10\\nOverall: 7/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f9462831f3b8f844a82600ef11d09af5'}>,\n",

Don\\'t even get me started on the lazy, repetitive dialoges, or how many times a character yells out another ones name to make things \\'dramatic\\'.\\nMost characters were annoying, mainly because they were walking stereotypes.

Three (or more) failed love-triangles, which had ineffective build ups and were executed poorly (I just didn\\'t care anymore at one point, it was too much). The main characters never even showed they really liked each other until we were reaching the end, which was a mistake if that couple was supposed to be the main selling point of this anime, it wasn\\'t believable and I couldn\\'t root for them. And then once Hitomi realizes who she loves (and it was all faith), she leaves his world forever because...? They don\\'t explain that part either, so much for true romance.\\nArt?

       "  <Document: {'content': '-- Please do not read if you have not watched this and/or do not like any spoilers. Thank you --\\nOk, maybe all that FMP watchin\\' made me want to revisit another tortured love story chock-full of action and beautifully drawn characters, so I cracked open the Special Edition box set of \"Vision of Escaflowne.\" I hadn\\'t seen this series since I was going to UCLA (and I only mention the school bit so that when I admit about my blubbering later, it won\\'t seem too pathetic).\\nI wasn\\'t sure I would ever want to see this again since my first impression of the series went from\\nindifference to impressed to infatuated with a finale of utter disappointment! I had never cried so hard, not from sadness, but because I was that horrified that any story could build up such a fantastic love story only to part the couple by the greatest of distances. (I\\'ll get into this later but I did want to address the good first.)\\nLike all good anime, there is a combination of burgeoning romance, love triangles, surrounded by action, good vs. evil, and surprises. High school track runner Hitomi Kanzaki is mysteriously transported to another world called Gaea where she is torn between her feelings for Allen Schezer and the feelings she didn\\'t realize she has for Van Fanel.\\nInitially, I couldn\\'t get past the character designs based on the overly elongated and pointy noses. Once I got used to it, the rest was easy. As a fan of mecha and medieval knights, Escaflowne does a fantastic job with their Guymelef designs: essentially, they are over-sized suits of armor that have a Da Vinci-esque design of mechanisms ala mechas from Macross, etc.\\nI love the look of blending medieval and organic materials with modern/sci-fi technology and the designs here don\\'t disappoint. Escaflowne transform into a flying dragon which fits in naturally in Gaea where the Samurai are knights of their respective realms, dragons are slain as a rite of passage, and transportation is via horses and ships (but ships that fly, natch).\\nEven if the series was rushed and unfairly edited down into their 26 eps (from an original 39, I\\'d read), they did a wonderful job of introducing us to these various characters who grow and develop over each episode. And here\\'s the rub, for me: the relationship between Hitomi and Van seems platonic enough upon meeting. They are thrown together by fate and no other reason. She is immediately infatuated with Allen because of his chivalry and his looks (since he reminds her of her upper classmate Amano, who she has a crush on). Van is just this young king who is rash, stubborn, and immature in more ways than one. And because of these differences, it\\'s rewarding to see Van gain experience and maturity over the series and to see how much he and Hitomi are always making sure the other is alright. They realize way after the fact that each is in love with the other - it\\'s tender and sweet.\\nOne of my favorite heartbreaking scenes is Van having gone to find Hitomi in the rain, only to see her in Allen\\'s arms (above). This love triangle has some of the best subtle moments of jealousy as evidenced by the characters facial expressions (which says a lot for an animated show), such as when Van extends his hand to Hitomi to jump aboard Escaflowne only to look slightly hurt when Allen picks her up and hops over with her. Hitomi also briefly goes back to Earth only to return to Gaea when she and Van simultaneously realize they want to see each other again.\\nI prattle on about this because all these great moments are completely annihilated by the ending of the series. The conflicts of war and violence on Gaea have been resolved and the kingdom of Fanelia is in a peaceful era of Reconstruction. Hitomi tells Van she would like to stay on Gaea with him. Van says that\\'s just fine with him, but that they could see each other any time anyway. So Hitomi says goodbye to Van and begins to levitate upwards in the magical light column. Everyone on Gaea is also sending Hitomi their farewells too.\\nNow, I could live with this kind of vagueness since the very end shows Hitomi back on Earth where Van visits her (whether it be only a vision or a quick light column visit, I can\\'t quite tell but!) and she tells him she is doing fine. What KILLS me is that as she was leaving Van, she tells him that she will never forget him, even when she becomes old - all of which implies she won\\'t be with him ever again! This still upsets me now because it totally ruins (for me) the idea that maybe they will be together again one day, maybe after she\\'s out of school. But to say that you\\'ll never forget someone is to say that you\\'ll never be or see someone again. So WTF is going on there?\\nI read one post on a message board saying s/he felt they\\'d be together again once she is done with high school, and I want to believe such a happy ending myself. But if they\\'d only cut out the \"I\\'ll never forget you\" crap, I\\'d feel more optimistic. I can\\'t really explain why this stupid ending upsets me so. I mean, it\\'s a frickin\\' animated show with a vague enough ending that I really could force myself to believe whatever I want. So why am I still angry? *sigh* I wish I knew. I guess I feel such a beautifully well done story is thrown away when it can\\'t be wrapped up as well as it was unfurled in the beginning. But, there\\'s something about the Japanese (or most Asian) cultures that can\\'t seem to shake the disappointing and unfulfilled love stories.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1a6a3eab4a00b616a1d73f6f682f0070'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"For lovers of full-blooded sci-fi fantasy drama, Escaflowne is a must-see. Produced in 1996, this 26-episode series begins in modern-day Japan where we are introduced to Hitomi Kanzaki, an insecure, lovestruck student who has a special gift for telling fortunes using cards. She has eyes for the handsome captain of the boy's track team, but before she can confess her feelings, Hitomi finds herself magically whisked away to a far-off planet known as Gaea. This strange new place is filled with luscious forests and kingdoms that look as though they could have been drawn from 18th Century France, and are inhabited not only by humans,\\nbut by talking humanoid animal creatures as well! Two young men--Van, a brash, hot-headed young prince, and Allen, a charismatically charming knight--vie for Hitomi's affections while their girlfriends, sassy cat-girl Merle and lovely Princess Millerna, become jealous of her. As if this isn't troublesome enough, the entire world of Gaea is at war with the Zaibach Empire, led by the brooding Chief Strategos Folken, sadistically bloodthirsty commander Dilandau, and the shadowy Emperor Dornkirk. What follows is an epic drama that unfolds gradually as Hitomi deals with her feelings for both Van and Allen and the kingdoms of Gaea band together to defeat the opposing Zaibachs.\\nIt's no wonder that this ambitious Japanese Anime series has been highly acclaimed by both reviewers and fans. For a television-made serial, production values are spectacular. The colors are rich and vibrant with imagination, and there are even some impressive, but subtle use of computer generated effects in various episodes.\\nWhat makes Escaflowne compelling as a series, though, is its labyrinthine storyline. Every episode built my interests, inspiring me to keep on watching, even when it sometimes slows down to concentrate on character development. Speaking of which, the folks who inhabit this tale are psychologically complex, showcasing positive traits as well as inner demons. Hitomi is a very confused, sometimes fickle young woman who is attracted to many people yet cannot seem to decide who she truly loves. Van is a socially washed-up young man who has suffered traumatic experiences in childhood and as such maintains an aggressive exterior. Allen, meanwhile, is handsome, dashing, and instantly wins the hearts of every women around (although it turns out that he too has an unfortunate past involving his father). While Van and Allen seem to respect each other at the forefront, their feelings for Hitomi threatens to cause tragic tension. Equally interesting are the scenes involving Folken and Dilandau. The former is calm and placid, while the latter is ever-ready to display aggressiveness.\\nThe action sequences are skillfully choreographed, namely the ones where the titular mechanical giant--Escaflowne--an impressively customized suit of armor, squares off against similar mechas. Also worthy of note is Yoko Kanno's music, an ingeniously rich mixture of John Williams, classical music, and ethnic choral chanting. If anything, it was this soundtrack that captured my interests just as much as the characters and artistry. Kanno truly is a talented musician, and her works can easily hold their own against Joe Hisaishi's scores for Miyazaki's features.\\nAll this, plus a whole lot more, makes Escaflowne an intriguing, creative series not only ideal for teenagers, but for a more mature audience as well. (Plus, it doesn't delve too much into excessive violence or mindnumbingly misplaced filler dreck, either.)\\nEscaflowne was first brought to the U.S. by the Fox Kids Network, and unfortunately it suffered from a series of cuts and drastic changes--notably the replacement of Kanno's masterful score with techno(!). Thankfully, the DVD release by BANDAI (which, by the way, has some interesting extras--namely the interviews with the Japanese staff) offers the entire series uncut and unaltered, and the Fox-produced changes have NOT been ported over to the DVD's English language track, so no problems there.\\nThat said, some folks have issues with the dub, produced by Canada-based Ocean Studios; while it has its share of problems, notably occasional scripting mistakes in the TV series (Folken calling Van &quot;brother&quot; at a time when he's not supposed to, for one), and Andrew Francis' jarring portrayal of Dilandau (he plays him more like a spoiled brat rather than a maniac), this English track does benefit from some generally good voices. In particular, Kirby Morrow and Brian Drummond are superb as Van and Allen, Paul Dobson does an excellent job as Folken, but Jocelyn Loewyn takes the cake for the best performance overall as Merle; mainly because she reminded me of Angora Deb's delightfully sassy Leaf in the Lodoss War TV series (and I like these kind of voices, too). Kelly Sheridan, meanwhile, makes a decent Hitomi, although there are some times when she doesn't emote as strongly as she should. But even after hearing bits and pieces of the (higher-caliber) Japanese language track, I don't consider this dub to be too unaffordable for folks who can't stand subtitles.\\nEither way, chances are that you will find yourself absorbed in the dramatic power, twisting plot, and imaginative sceneries of Escaflowne from the moment you first lay your eyes on the dazzling opening sequences.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '60e4b5267e06bfdb867ff3fbd2c27a79'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Let\\'s start with the elephant in the room- when you watch, and subsequently review, an anime for the very first time quite literally more than two decades after its original release, that\\'s just really hard. Trying to review something in the present as opposed to in its own time is simply not fair, and I think if I\\'d written my review in 1996 it would be very different than this review is going to be, so please keep that in mind when reading beyond this point.\\nSome parts of The Vision of Escaflowne have aged well. Others haven\\'t. And I think a viewer largely has to\\njust accept that. All in all, while it certainly isn\\'t a 10 by today\\'s standards (though I can see why it potentially could have been back when it was originally released) it is clear as day to me why this anime is still considered a beloved and timeless classic of the medium. Let\\'s get into specifics-\\nArt-\\nArt/graphics/visual presentation is almost always the easiest thing to notice when watching an older anime. Visually it\\'s simply dated, period, but like I said it really isn\\'t fair to compare a 1996 anime to 2019 visual standards. Back in that era the visuals were just fine if not very good. One thing I didn\\'t care for regarding the visual presentation, and this has nothing to do with the age of the anime, is the choice to give damn near every single character a particularly large nose. Especially in shots from the side this is an anime of many Pinocchios.\\nWhile the visuals haven\\'t aged well, they haven\\'t aged terribly either. Nothing will make your eyes bleed- it just looks old. Take it for what it is and enjoy the meat and potatoes of the show, which was never its visual presentation to begin with.\\nSound-\\nTo be clear, The Vision of Escaflowne essentially has three different voice packages available- the original Japanese, the original English and a much later English re-dub by Funimation. I watched the original English version. By today\\'s standards the voice acting is below par. Many characters have exaggerated, over the top, non-believable voices that the actors take too far, with egregious examples being that of Mole Man, Dilandau and a number of Allen\\'s followers.\\nWhile main character Hitomi\\'s voice wasn\\'t BAD per say, I often felt it didn\\'t fit the character and had a cadence to it that just seemed a bit off. Also, from very early on, the voice actress reminded me a lot of Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz, as I feel both women speak similarly.\\nThe music was nice with a couple very good tracks but compared to some of the other works of Yoko Kanno- including sheer masterpieces such as the soundtrack of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex- this simply wasn\\'t as good. There wasn\\'t that one incredible, gripping, defining track the way the aforementioned anime had \"The Real Folk Blues\" and \"Inner Universe\" respectively.\\nCharacter/Story-\\nDated graphics and voice acting aside, the story and the ride are the reason to watch The Vision of Escaflowne and while the generic \"girl gets whisked away to a foreign land and gets wrapped up in its conflicts in a big way\" plotline has subsequently been done countless times, no anime I\\'ve seen does it quite like Escaflowne does and the story here, while a bit of a slow starter, absolutely holds up remarkably well today and finishes strong, albeit maybe a smidge rushed.\\nCharacter development is strong in this anime, at least among the main cast. Certain secondary characters, the biggest of which being Merle, who is in the anime very close to from start to finish, really doesn\\'t have a lot of depth to her or add a lot to the anime. To be fair, with a sizable cast it\\'d be tough to properly develop everyone and the main characters, both the good and the bad, do get proper development for the most part.\\nAs I mentioned before, I wasn\\'t sold on Escaflowne for the first little bit as it takes its time getting to the goods and I was maybe even a little bored in the first third or so of the show, but I\\'m glad I stuck it out. Its mid section gets good and its latter third or so gets great and I was definitely invested and enjoying my viewing experience at that point.\\nThe scope and scale of what this anime set out to achieve, especially given when it came out, is remarkable. This is, while imperfect, epic fantasy largely done right.\\nEnjoyment-\\nThe early stages were slow and somewhat boring but watchable, the middle was better and the late stages were great. There weren\\'t any offensively bad episodes or sections and the pacing as a whole is actually pretty decent- you just have to be willing to be patient with the show and let it get to its best stuff when it\\'s ready.\\nOverall-\\nWhile I think it\\'d be hard to argue that this anime has aged as well as certain other older anime, such as Cowboy Bebop, and while there are definitely a number of things one could nitpick such as some questionable voice acting, a few rushed/out of nowhere plot elements and a couple of cheesy conveniences The Vision of Escaflowne does enough right- and on a very large scale at that- to be worthy of a watch even today, 23 years later. I ended this anime with a smile and that\\'s always a good sign. Not necessarily an all time great in the grand scheme of things but absolutely, without a shred of doubt, an all time classic and a ride worth taking.\\n+Epic fantasy\\n+Main cast largely has depth and is not one-dimensional and cookie cutter\\n+Plot concept and execution that still hold up today\\n+Bold- not afraid to kill off characters, throw twists at you or go into dark territory\\n-Uneven voice acting with a few real stinkers\\n-A few rushed plot elements near the end\\n-Outdated in several ways and simply feels old/not modern to watch\\n1996 RATING- 9.5\\nOBJECTIVE 2019 RATING- 8\\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Weak 8', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '973e602853604a42926c7127f726995'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The Vision of Escaflowne is a lesson in a fine art. Taking you through this lesson, is a man by the name of Allen Schezar. Allen Schezar is a certified hunk, gold medalist, PhD in hunkology. This guy knows how to be a hunk and in The Vision of Escaflowne, he takes you through all the important steps on how you at home can be your very own hunk.\\nNow while at surface level, it may seem that being a hunk is all about good looks. That’s obviously the first step, and it’s not a step that Allen skips out on. This is entry level\\nstuff of course, but just because it’s entry level, doesn’t mean you’ll get it perfect. In fact, it’s a common rookie mistake to assume that chicks will dig long, tan and handsome. This is not the case. Allen has discovered through years of various flings with princesses that what chicks dig the most is, in fact, 6 foot tall guys with luscious blond locks and a knighthood. They like a little danger, but not too much. They also like a little financial security, but again, not too much.\\nNow throughout Escaflowne, we see Allen putting a good deal of his skills to the test in an attempt to woo a high-schooler from a foreign planet and a princess on the side just in case, through some enormous miscalculation, he cannot win the heart of the girl easily 10 years younger than him. Near the start of the series, Allen slips in a little cover for her (forgot to mention the high-school girl’s name is Hitomi, not that it’s important, but for distinction) presence at his outpost that she’s a girlfriend of his and things get a little hot under the collar. Now, this is a very important scene to note, as this is Allen showing just how adept he is at capitalising on rare situations to plant the seed in the head of the girl that perhaps, he’s just the right hunk for her. This is just one of many examples where Allen flexes his astute adlib abilities, but more on that later.\\nUnfortunately for Hitomi, Allen is not the only hunk competing behind the scenes in the great hunk-royale that is Escaflowne. When she is abducted/transported to the planet Gaea in the presence of our intermediate level hunk (also referred to interchangeably as a jack-hunk or a learner-hunk), Van Fanel, who we’ll talk a little more about after this, she leaves behind another hunk whom she was about to make her personal hunk before her untimely departure. So, already Allen is having to compete unbeknownst with this other hunk in a psychological battle right from the beginning, which is nothing to sneeze at for even the most advanced ace-hunk like Allen. But at the same time, Allen must also do battle with Van Fanel, who takes on the role of Hitomi’s side-hunk.\\nVan takes an interesting approach to hunking, though he may not look it, he certainly knows how to hold his own against Allen. For a start, Van is a king, so Allen’s in some pretty big trouble. Even though he may not be as good a sword-fighter as Allen, he’s getting there, which is almost as interesting for chicks as actually being top trump. Van also has black hair, which you know means he’s incredibly gifted and is passionate about his cause. He’s also within age range, which adds an interesting flavour aaaaaaaaaaand he has a catgirl with pink hair clinging on. Now while the catgirl might not initially appear to have anything to do with it, you’ve got to realise that it adds a sense of game to it for Hitomi, if she wants this hunk, she’s gotta work for him.\\nBUT WAIT! It may look like Allen’s out of the game at this point, but not to worry as we’re introduced to his side-chick, Millerna and she’s not a catgirl, no, even better: she’s a princess. That’s like, top-tier competition for a schoolgirl.\\nWhile it may appear that there’s a story, themes and a plethora of other characters running through Escaflowne, it’s important to note that it’s all just a cover for the hunk-royale. There are several other hunks that make for an interesting clash of the hunks that appear throughout the story such as Dryden and Folken, but how do they fit into the hunk-off? Well, I’ve got to leave some surprises right, just like I’m not going to reveal who wins the hunk-off at the end, but just know it’s a close one!\\nOverall, I think Allen Schezar is a man who knows his art. For the entirety of the show, he is smooth af and he knows how to slip in and score a couple of extra points when nobody’s paying attention. I recommend this show to anyone who is further interesting in the study of hunkology, or is aspiring to be a hunk themselves. I think Escaflowne is even a good watch for those who are already ace-hunks or king-hunks because I think Allen has a lot to offer to help sharpen your skills.\\nSide note, Yoko Kanno is a genius kthnxbye!!! :]', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bd68bfbc76f172dcd3651064de0a07a8'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'You\\'ll notice a marked pacifist tone in many of the anime of the 80s and 90s. The horrors of war fresh in the national psyche, anime became a medium of expression for the postwar Japanese artists. Escaflowne is part of the 90s legacy. This 26-episode series was hand drawn from start to finish - even the visceral mecha battles. Though the frames-per-second ratio is a little sparce, the visuals hold up to this day.\\nEscaflowne is a masterful mix of opposite elements, telling a realistic but fantastical story set in a medieval milieu with sci-fi technology. Though the narrative focuses heavily on emotions, as is common\\nfor shoujo anime, the series boasts enough plot and action to satisfy varied audiences. In fact, the story develops so fast that the 20 minutes per episode feels just barely enough. Every aspect of Escaflowne; plot, characters, soundtrack, themes, visuals, is so tight that the story feels like it expands beyond its boundaries.\\nThough there\\'s no actual gore, Escaflowne admittedly tilts to the maturer side due to its violence. For instance, the mechas here don\\'t shoot lasers, but wield swords and \"liquified metal\" which slice through armor and flesh. In this show people die, nations burn, and though the many battle scenes look cool, the violence feels far from glorified. It\\'s actually rather harrowing to watch, even when it\\'s the bad guys who are bleeding.\\nThe cast of characters deserves an honorable mention.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Escaflowne is a mecha, action, romance anime (the best kind) which centers around Kanzaki Hitomi, a high school girl who is magically transported via a beam of light to a fictional planet called Gaea. She meets Van the King of a country named Fanelia who pilots a mysterious mecha called Escaflowne. He is possibly one of the hottest anime guys out there (for reals). She also meets Allen, a knight of a country called Asuturia. There she struggles with her emotions, wishes and the implications they have on the people around her and on Gaea.\\nStory (8/10): The story itself is very creative. I always\\ncommend a mecha series that can combine epic battles with heroism and of course romance. Though it is not a common theme with mecha, this story takes place in an alternate setting, involving time travel of some sort and the ever present high school age heroine. The supporting cast with a few strong characters including Dryden, Delandeau, Millerna and Folken add to the dynamics and emotion that is heavily entwined with this plot.\\nSound (10/10): The original soundtrack is the strongest part of the series making up for what was lacking in art. The background music in every fight scene and pivitol moment in the series added immense atmosphere to the battles and interactions. It was truly spectacular.\\nCharacter (9/10): The characters in this show did not dissapoint. All of them were very three dimensional including cast with limited air time like Naria and Eriya. Hitomi as a heroine was great in that she lacked what obnoxious shoujo heroines commonly have: ditziness and unrelenting surrealism - to an extent. Hitomi was fickle in her decisions and I really did get annoyed with her repetitive name yelling and wanting every situation to go her way. Van, however, is one of the more astounding male protagonists I've come across. Paired with an excellent voice actor, the audience can really feel Van's pain. He wasn't a bitch like many characters with traumatic pasts (cough Sasuke cough) but did what every man with a giant mecha should do: go into battle and mess people up. Overall I was very pleased with the characters in Escaflowne.\\nEnjoyment (9/10): Overall I loved the flow of the show and how cliff-hangers were strategically placed to get me to want to watch episodes back to back to find out what happened next. The unique mecha setting holds a strong allure for this show and the music is really the icing on the cake. You should watch this show if you enjoy fabulous seiyuus and an OST on par with that of Tsubasa Chronicles (the best sound track to date imo).\\nThis show is also worth the lulz for all of Hitomi's teenage angsty moments and for Van's perfectly-timed obliviousness.

It doesn\\'t mean I hate the anime. In fact, I really enjoyed Escaflowne. Heck, if I have the money, I can order the box set online and show it to a lot of my friends, as I think they\\'ll really like this kind of anime. I don\\'t deny that I can see why Escaflowne is so revered. It\\'s one of the first anime to throw in both shoujo and shounen\\nelements into one show. Heck, back in it\\'s heyday, it outsold Gundam of all shows on VHS tape here in the US, and fansubbers jumped on it during the 1990s VHS fansub era, so a lot of people agree that this anime is definitely a classic that should be remembered for all time. Unfortunately...while I do acknowledge it\\'s classic status, I don\\'t agree that it\\'s that great of a show. No no! Don\\'t get me wrong. I still enjoyed it to quite an extent. I\\'m just going to have to explain myself in this review.\\nI\\'m not going to tell about the plot because everybody and his freaking DOG knows that this kind of plot is as old as dirt. The characters are old as dirt, and it\\'s ending is kind of old as dirt. I\\'ve seen a lot of people praise Escaflowne for it\\'s awesomeness, and I do agree it is definitely awesome, but people are saying that it\\'s a perfect balance of shounen and shoujo tropes, and how it\\'s the greatest thing ever. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. Escaflowne is NOT a masterpiece. Why? Well, as I watched the show, I\\'m kind of surprised by not what people mention, but what they DO NOT mention, and Escaflowne has some pretty jarring flaws, a lot of which so many people actually overlook. What flaws? Well, if I could compare Escaflowne to something, it would be to a bullet train and an automatic machine gun that shoots bullets every second. It\\'s pacing is so fast it\\'s unbelievable! I feel like Escaflowne just throws stuff at you and expects you to take it all in without any question whatsoever. Basically, the show just DOESN\\'T CALM THE HECK DOWN! It\\'s like it really really wants to show you this amazing, epic story so they throw it in your face and shove it down your throat without giving you time to swallow it. There are hardly any quiet moments in the show (except for the first episode and some parts in others), and the ones that are there don\\'t last long unless stated otherwise! Not only that, there\\'s little to no proper transition from scene to scene, and even from episode to episode! I watch an episode, then another episode pops up and doesn\\'t even reference what happened in the last one and goes on like it expects you to go along with it without question! Everything just explodes at you and leaves a bunch of scars. Well, I can kind of see why it\\'s execution and pacing are so chaotic. This was originally planned to be 39 episodes, but apparently due to time constraint issues and funding problems, they had to cut it down to 26, and even then the animators came up with too much animated material, so they had to cut quite a few scenes out before broadcast, and, really, IT SHOWS!! Maybe the episode extension would have rectified this problem. Well, a lot of people say this is a good thing because there\\'s no filler. I can understand why they think this is great, and I agree. Every little frame of the show focuses on it\\'s story and it is dead set on telling it, without any pointlessness (and I should also mention that the animators were strictly told not to give Hitomi any underwear shots. THANK GOD FOR THAT!!!) or extraneous material, so that I can praise...but maybe a little quiet, soothing, turn-off-your-brain-and-relax kind of filler wouldn\\'t hurt.\\nNow I must speak of the animation. Honestly, when it can be, it can be wicked awesome, especially in that part of the opening sequence when you see Escaflowne sword fighting with another guymelef (is that one supposed to be Dilandau\\'s? They never say)! But yes, since this was made in 1996, it IS pretty outdated, but it\\'s definitely aged a heck of a lot more gracefully than other shows in the nineties. Another thing I notice about the animation is that it\\'s very distinct. It\\'s different from other anime of it\\'s time, and it shows. The noses are kind of big, but this never bothered me because I always thought noses were supposed to look like that in real life too. Not only that, every single character has their own look. No character looks exactly the same, unlike vice versa, which is becoming more and more apparent. Facial expressions are very distinct, but at times they can be very exaggerated, in the case of one character I\\'ll mention later on. I love the way Gaea looks, as it\\'s very European and Indian-based. According to some sources, Shoji Kawamori was inspired to make this after a trip to Nepal. You can really see the effort that the animators and art directors put into the setting, the art, the castle designs, everything. Heck, the empire of Zaibach just SCREAMS industrial revolution, and considering it\\'s backstory, the whole industrial revolution thing going for it really fits it to a T. But at times the animation can be a bit static, and there are quite a few still frames, but hey! This was the nineties! Those were standard back in the day! The character movement is pretty good for it\\'s time, too.\\nThe music...oh sweet magna carta, I simply MUST sing all kinds of praises for the music! Remember how I said once that I thought 07-Ghost had one of the most Godly, non Kajiura music in all of anime? Well, Escaflowne\\'s soundtrack blows it out of the water here! Seriously, this was one of Yoko Kanno\\'s first soundtracks for any anime (her actual first being Please Save My Earth). It\\'s so hard to believe that even back then, Kanno had such an awesome knack for music, especially in terms of booming, classical, 1940s-esque orchestras and choirs, and I LOVE big, booming classical orchestras and choirs. Yoko Kanno pretty much fulfilled my musical wishes here, as every single piece of music fits every scene in show wonderfully. The epic choirs really bring out the epic in various fight scenes, though sometimes I do think some BGMs play in the wrong places, but that only happens once or twice throughout the series. I kept on wondering why everybody liked Yoko Kanno so much. Now I see the reason why, and I happily agree with them! This is a soundtrack I seriously MUST OWN!!\\nThere\\'s been a lot of debate about the characters lately, especially on places like TV Tropes. I\\'m just going to tell my personal opinions about the characters. To be honest, as much as I liked a majority of the characters, I really didn\\'t connect to them personally. For me, in order for me to truly love an anime and put it in my top lists, I\\'d have to connect with the characters on a personal level, particularly a majority of them, whether it\\'s because I relate to their personality or the problems they face or feel sympathy for them, it all has to come down to whether I connect or identify with them or not. I didn\\'t feel that with most of the characters for Escaflowne. Now don\\'t get me wrong, this doesn\\'t mean I hate them. If there\\'s one thing I love about the characters in Escaflowne, it\\'s the fact that every single one of them is flawed. Nobody\\'s perfect. Even the characters who even look and act perfect have secret flaws they don\\'t want others to see out of fear that they\\'d be hated for it. That\\'s what made me really like them, and I think the staff behind the show knew this. Unfortunately, despite this, I didn\\'t find most of the main characters very interesting. Oh God, I seriously hated that Mole Man. I don\\'t see why he\\'s in the show! However, I do like Hitomi. Not very many people like her, but I find her to be very realistic. She\\'s not some overly perfect Mary Sue character, a violence prone angry chick, a big-boobed bimbo who throws her privates in a guy\\'s face, a clumsy thick-headed ditz, or other dumb female stereotypes. I think she\\'s a strong character and if you really take the time to imagine yourself in her situation, you have to admit her actions in the show are pretty reasonable and even plausible and understandable, though I can see why people don\\'t like her much. I mean, seriously, she\\'s a heck of a lot better than Miaka from Fushigi Yugi, right? I also really like Folken, one of the villains. Why? Watch the show and see!\\nHowever...there is ONE character that I not only connected with on a very personal level for very weird reasons, but I actually identified with to the point where I almost relived my childhood memories from 4th grade when I still had my childish crush on a Yu-Gi-Oh character. I really like this character, and apparently so do a lot of other people! This character alone made me persist in continuing with this series despite the show\\'s very jarring and obvious flaws. Who is this character, you ask? It is...Dilandau. Yeah, I\\'m a sophomore in college, yet I somehow not only strongly connected and identified with a completely psycho pyromaniac who likes abusing his compadres on a regular basis and setting things on fire and blowing stuff up for the fun of it, but am actually developing a fangirl crush on him! I know it sounds stupid, but it\\'s true! Heck, other people had crushes on him in the 90s when the show aired! Yeah, I know, Dilandau\\'s obnoxious, cocky, cruel, homicidal, completely off the ball, and acts like a spoiled brat throughout 90% of the show, and is basically everything that I HATE in a person, yet...once you learn about him and see him suffer horribly (even if it\\'s for a little bit. The show doesn\\'t go into too much detail about it for some reason), you feel your heartstrings get yanked and you want to save him once you realize he\\'s no different from any other disturbed, lonely, scared teenager who just wants a friend, especially considering how young he is! He\\'s basically the best and most developed anime villain that ever graced the silver screen. He\\'s a villain, yet he\\'s so relatable and in a way so human that you can\\'t help but identify with him! He makes you laugh, makes you cry, scares the living crap out of you, he does it all! Why can\\'t more anime villains be like him?!...if only his English dub voice were better! Seriously, I made the mistake of watching the English dub first and...oh my God, Dilandau\\'s English voice is UNGODLY HIGH AND SQUEAKY!!! He sounds like he hasn\\'t even reached puberty yet, and his voice actor was 15 back when the dub was made! How can a 15 year old still have that high a voice?! He sounds so chirpy! I mean, his actor does a great job at capturing his brattiness, arrogance, and his craziness in his really scary moments, and in other scenes the voice increases his cuteness (if he has any) in some areas, but I just CANNOT take Dilandau seriously with that BABY VOICE, especially in the creepy moments (\"Cheek...cheek...cheek...\")! Wanna know the freakiest thing of all? Dilandau\\'s voice actor does the voices of Shining Armor and Braeburn from My Little Pony, both of whom have deep voices! I can never look at them or listen to them the same way ever again!!! Seriously, Dilandau\\'s Japanese and German voices are waaaaay better!...though the German dub actually ADDs to his creepiness and brings it up to so many disturbing levels it\\'s not even funny...AND I LOVE IT!!! I need to rewatch this show in German sometime, even though I know NO German whatsoever.\\nOkay, enough of all that random babbling. I already talked about this show\\'s flaws so I see no need to go through them...though I do admit the ending is a little weird. But I\\'ve seen worse anime endings so I can give it a pass, that and it\\'s not nearly as jarring as the rest of the show\\'s problems. Escaflowne in itself deals with a lot of mature and heavy themes like magic, war, missing and illegitimate children, love triangles, and the concept of fate and playing with it. Unfortunately because the show is so compressed, I wasn\\'t able to comprehend a lot of it. I do, however, definitely give Escaflowne credit for being a fun, epic, thrilling adventure show with a lot to love (I still can\\'t get that soundtrack and Dilandau out of my head! Also, Prince Chid and his dub voice are SOOOO CUTE!!!) and it definitely deserves it\\'s place as a classic. I just don\\'t agree with a lot of people on WHY it should be a classic. Do I think it has perfect pacing? No. It\\'s way too fast for me to fully comprehend. Do I think it\\'s perfectly balanced? No, it needs more quiet moments, more polishing, and more development. Do I think it has great characters? Well, while some definitely stand out (Dilandau and Folken for me), the rest of them don\\'t strike a chord with me. Do I think it looks good? Yes, definitely. Do I think it\\'s groundbreaking? For it\\'s time, yes. Do I think it has a great soundtrack? YES.\\nWhile in my eyes it\\'s not perfect, this is definitely an anime that should not be missed by anyone, and...come on!

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Vision of Escaflowne is a woefully underrated show. It comes from that time in the \\'90s when anime played hop-scotch over the line between shounen and shoujo. There is plenty of romance, and love triangles abound, but it\\'s set in the middle of a war and  there are giant robots, bloodbaths, and dragons.\\nA psychic high school girl named Hitomi gets pulled onto the mysterious planet of Gaia where  the earth and moon are visible in the night sky and anthropomorphic animals exist. Gaia seems to be in it\\'s Mideaval period with monarchy still in effect, but has very different technology than Earth. There\\nare no computers, phones, or cars, but there are  airships and giant mobile suits. The mechs, called Gymelofs, are amazingly designed. They look like a knight\\'s suit of armor and move with gears and steam. They\\'re completely believable in the swords and dragons setting. The \"magic\" in Escaflowne is really more \"mysticism\" and has definite rules.\\nPersonally, I really like Escaflowne\\'s art work. The style is very different than most anime with the characters having long, prominent noses, and round rather than spiky hair. The series is unique and the art reflects that, though it did take some getting used to. It\\'s drawn very consistently, which usually seems to be a problem in 90\\'s anime. The colors can sometimes feel a little murky, but mostly it works for that \"Dark Ages\" feel. The animation was above average for it\\'s time.\\nThe sound is FANTASTIC. Yoko Kanno did the music, so really, what else do you need to know? She beautifully blends Japanese lyrics and Olde Worlde European ballads that sound like they\\'re played on harp and hammer dolcemer. The more modern sounding poppier songs are never out of place, and there are Gregorian monks chanting \"Esca! flow! ne!\" The original Japanese voice cast is very, very good, and the dub is surprisingly watchable with the standout roles being the villains. Dub!Hitomi\\'s and Allan\\'s voices may take some warming up to, but over all I recommend the sub and dub equally.\\nEscaflowne has a large cast of richly detailed characters and as more is revealed about their back stories, their actions become more understandable and relate-able. Even the villains are given this same treatment and care. Van, our main male hero, starts out brash and seemingly apathetic, but we learn that he is actually trying desperately and has an inordinate amount to prove. Hitomi is a real asset in battle. She\\'s smart, an athlete, and rarely needs to be saved. She\\'s a tough, interesting girl, and she will tell you what she thinks of things. Like any shoujo heroine, she\\'s prone to the occasional romantic flights of fancy, but they fit the story and are endearing. Millerna is a princess studying to get a  medical degree and doesn\\'t mind leaving her castle to travel with our rag tag group of protagonist. The final standout is the utterly psychotic villain Dilandou.\\nUsually, character driven shows are my favorites, but where Escaflowne really shines is the plot. There are more twists than you would ever innitially imagine. The writers managed to weave in mythology like Atlantis and even include Isaac Newton while keeping things completely believable. The pacing is good (no filler!) and the storytelling really makes you think and figure things out. The ending is bittersweet in a really effecting way and all the story elements fit together like puzzle pieces--the proof of good plotting.\\nThe world, Gaia, is also a fantastic part of the show. The world building is immense and immersive. Gaia has it\\'s own histories, various races, political structures, belief systems and customs that are unique but logical.\\nEscaflowne is one of my favorite shows for it\\'s sheer brilliance and originality. It really takes you inside the characters\\' heads and we are asked to deal with their experiences in this war as it brings more of their pasts back to confront them.\\nWatch Escaflowne if you like mechs. Watch Escaflowne if you like your shoujo romance with a healthy dose of action. Watch Escaflowne if you want an epic fantasy. Watch Escaflowne if you want a complex, intelligent plot.\\nReally, you should just watch Escaflowne.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '742518548101dac109902ebed0c38582'}>,\n",

For instance, is it just me or her carrying her bag with her into the other world was a smart move on the writers. It actually gives her a reason to be dressed up in her school uniform unlike every other show out there. Now there are some things in this show that remind me a lot of Inu-yasha. It’s the whole transportation thing. I really don’t like how they keep recapping the last episode. I feel they could have really gone without that. They do it in a way that reminds me\\nof the opening to YuGiOh. I am happy about the very little fan service that is in this show. You rarely see anything that would be considered fan service except for the cat girl at some points.\\nThe Artwork is interesting and very vintage, done pretty well for the time period that it was created as. The backgrounds feel almost oil based and rather pretty. Sadly, the stuff that is on the cell animation is lacking badly, and even when it’s supposed to be on the background or is seen close up, it’s again disappointing. The characters though are nicely designed. Some of the characters look like they are from other animes, such as the ‘wizard’ on the other side, Folken,  looks like Vash and a side knight in Allan’s court, Getin I think his name is, looks a little like Wolfwood. It just makes me think of Clamp.\\nThe voices in the English version are pretty good to me considering as well. Hitomi’s voice doesn’t make me cringe as bad as I would of thought, although, is it just me or does she sound a lot like Kagome from Inu-yasha? Sadly, the English and Japanese versions of the script differ a bit more then I would like sadly though they kept the just of what they were talking about. They had even cut out a lot some of the excess dialog. It’s bad when there is a little gap between when someone is supposed to say something and they are supposed to be interrupted. The Japanese seems a little better in that aspect. The music in the background is very hunting and kind of like Yugioh in a strange way.\\nThe ending made me laugh so hard.

It’s also more up beat then the opening which doesn’t really make me get into the story.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'be278e11b98802a4ad1100ad1f62a43b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Escaflowne. This one was tricky for me. I had heard a lot about this series growing up and had recently been on a binge to watch some of the classics that came out in the 90's. The art for its time was well done and the music was powerful instrumental...though after awhile I was tired of hearing the same song. For 15 episodes I was highly enthralled and the episodes had fantastically placed cliff hangers making you instantly click onto the next one right away, but...it lost me.\\nFor the beginning of the series you see the main character as a believable person, good head on\\nher shoulders, but as the series progresses I found her to be contradictory and in general her personality was all over the place. Happy one minute, sad the next, angry five seconds later. The romance aspect isn't very romantic. It seemed like a sad after thought with love triangles overlapping love triangles. The characters would suddenly fawn over each other for no real given reason, then creating tension in the group because two people like the same person.\\nCharacter wise I don't feel like I actually 'cared' for anyone. They could have killed anyone off and I would have shrugged my shoulders without really a care in the world. People would be introduced and then vanish the next episode, only to reappear three episodes later. The main 'group' kept splitting up and the whole time frame of the story was confusing. Two people would leave for battle 'far away' in another city, then another character would have a bad feeling and would decide to join them and arrive far too quickly considering they were in separate countries.\\nThe mech fighting was cool but had a lot of random angst scenes thrown into it, slightly killing the mood. One thing that did bother me was the main characters abilities. They were pretty fascinating at first until it got out of hand and her 'bad thoughts' created 'negative' futures. It just seemed very unnecessary.\\nThe biggest problem was the complete drop off in plot. The end was unsatisfying, anticlimactic, and in my personal opinion....horribly written. I had so many hopes for this anime, but it just fell so far short.

Their actions were realistic and relatable.\\nPacing: The story was very deep/complex but due to the pacing/number of episodes, it could have been better if it was longer. The story moved at a slightly fast paced due to financial reasons and 1/3 of the full series (of\\n39 episodes) had to be crammed into all 26 episodes.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'tl;dr: This series is Outlaw Star + Fushigi Yuugi + Gundam, with some dragons/angels and a (tiny) bit of influence from Dune thrown in. If you love action anime from the 90\\'s, particularly Wolf\\'s Rain, Cowboy Bebop, and the aforementioned Outlaw Star (all of which had staff involved in \"Vision of Escaflowne\"), then \"Escaflowne\" is definitely for you! Also, I HIGHLY recommend watching the recent Funimation dub!\\nLong ver (no spoilers):\\nBehind the phenomenal score and art, \"Vision of Escaflowne\" is a break-neck fast, highly creative - and yet sloppy - story. The experience of watching this series is like reading a pulpy science fiction novel\\nin both the best and worst ways: events happen with such force and such quickness that it feels somehow magnetic and addicting, even though you know what you\\'re reading is a bit of travesty. \"Escaflowne\" had an amazing first half (or perhaps 3 quarters?) chock full of opportunity, as fascinating aspects of the world and characters were introduced one after another. The characters subvert many archetypes, and the series constantly hints at deeper emotional depths within its whole cast: secrets and motivations for Van\\'s, Allen\\'s, and Hitomi\\'s actions that will be revealed to the viewer in the coming episodes, just around the corner. I started to empathize with the characters and their struggles, and I anticipated big emotional payoffs as a result.\\nBy the last ten episodes, however, I began to notice shortcomings, and they were piling up fast. Escaflowne suffered from many problems, from silly plot decisions to a lack of space for conflicts to breathe, but the shortcomings basically all boil down to one thing: pacing. The ending wasn\\'t a train-wreck, necessarily, but it came close, and I can see now that Escaflowne\\'s budget/episode cuts hurt it immensely. There simply wasn\\'t enough time given to the multitude of twists and turns for them to make sense, and as soon as one new piece of information was revealed, it was often dumped quickly and never heard about again. Furthermore, some pieces of information introduced probably did not need to be introduced in the first place, therefore allowing more time and focus being spent on other, more identifiable issues - motivations for certain characters, for example. This led to TONS of inconsistencies that hurt any messages Escaflowne tried to impart, such as the morality of war, the legitimacy of attraction and love, etc.. Did Escaflowne want me to stand up and fight, or did it want me to love thy enemy? Did it want me to follow my heart or be a little more pragmatic in love? Even simple facts about the plot were under the microscope: what even is Escaflowne itself? What is Hitomi\\'s pendant, and is it made of the same stuff as those  energy spheres?\\nNone of the above questions, by the way, were questions the series *wanted* to ask its viewers on purpose. These questions are not intentional thought exercises but instead result from confusing, sloppy storytelling.\\nWhat was revealed about the characters never received enough attention. In fact, the cast rarely seems to catch a break from the action (seriously, fights and escapes and kidnappings happen so fast that they start to blend into one another) and when they do receive a break, the internal conflicts have very little consistency or depth. As a result, I never got the emotional payoff the series was building us up to. Even the romantic developments - which receive a decent amount of screen time compared to other action/sci-fi anime - felt dull.\\nAnd then, all in all, I have no idea what the villains were actually *doing* beyond the first few episodes. I know what they were trying to accomplish, but really, I am at a loss as to what they actually *did* to further their goals besides surprise attacking the MCs.\\nDespite the fact that by the last quarter of the series the train was almost off the rails, I consumed each episode like a madman. I enjoyed it. Escaflowne possesses a very clear Something that only exists in well-made 90\\'s anime, and that Something is charming and delightful to behold. Maybe it\\'s the thick, hand-drawn ink lines and dynamic character designs, or maybe it\\'s Yoko Kanno\\'s score, rich with ominous choir chanting one moment to charged orchestral pieces the next. Maybe it\\'s the unabashed creativity that infuses the world and its tropes, or maybe it\\'s the wonderful hodgepodge of genres at work.\\nThere was a lot of heart and experimentation put into the world of Escaflowne, from the eerie Zaibachs and their machinery - which remind me so much of Giger\\'s illustrations for Jodorowsky\\'s \"Dune\" - to the relationship between the Mystic Moon and Gaea. The kind of full creative expression the creators show in this series - or at least most of it, before the budget cuts - even felt freeing to me, as the viewer. Hell, it was inspiring. After the slog of cute-girls-doing-cute-things, Madoka-rip-offs, and I\\'m-trying-way-too-hard-to-be-a-serious-thought-provoking-masterpiece shows that modern anime has become, this pure sci-fi sandbox was the breath of fresh air I needed.\\nTo me, \"Vision of Escaflowne\" represents the fun of the artist in creating their own serial on their own terms.

The premise of the story sounds a but cliche at first- high school girl is brought to a faraway world where she uses her newfound powers to save the land. And okay, if you want to summarize Escaflowne in that sentence then fine, but it does the series a great injustice.\\nFirstly, I have to say that the pacing of this series is by far the best I have ever seen in any anime period. This is a no-filler anime folks,\\nI can guarantee you that. Every scene and every character interaction adds to the tale. This phenomenal pacing really made me want to keep watching, and it also made me shocked when an episode ended, because to me it felt like I had only been watching for five minutes. The writers really did a great job, and I especially appreciate this when so many animes that I've tried watching are stuffed with filler.\\nI actually thoroughly enjoyed the art style, particularly the character and mecha designs. Yes, the show was made in 1996 so it's a little dated, but I've always been a bit of a softy for the old-school design. All of the characters were very distinctive, and even the different nations throughout Gaea have a different aesthetic feel to them. For example, Asturia had a European feel to it while Freid had more of an Asian feel. It really helped to give the impression that Gaea really was its own world.\\nWhat makes this story a hit are most definitely the characters. At first glance the characters appear to be of the fantasy genre archetypes: the young and stubborn new king, the perfect knight, the confused and boy-crazy schoolgirl... but let me tell you this show really builds these characters into something more than that. A lot of the focus is on character interactions, and I grew to very much like and care for the characters.\\nOh, and I can't forget the soundtrack! The music is my Yoko Kanno, and it is a real treat. Gorgeous orchestral and piano sounds are to be heard (I'm a sucker for a great orchestra), and the opening theme feels very majestic, coupled with nice vocals.\\nIt's been a long time since I've so thoroughly enjoyed an anime; I strongly recommend this.

Review #42: The Vision of Escaflowne.\\nSometimes there are things in life that fortune will smile upon, but is it wise to toy with fate? There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. We have the power to change the future. With that said, let\\'s explore the world of Gaea with... The Vision of Escaflowne\\nHigh school student Hitomi Kanzaki is a freshman and is talented in Track and Field. She somehow transported from Earth to the magical world of Gaea, where she meets a young prince named Van Fanel, and is caught up in his quest to\\nunite the countries of Gaea against the ominous Zaibach empire. On the way, she discovers an hidden secret and strives to unravel layers of mystery surrounding Van, his past, and the giant machine known as Escaflowne.\\nTo be technical, this is a Sunrise production and this anime is proof that the animation in this show has aged very well. Some poeple don\\'t like some of the character designs in this show because they always point out that the \"noses\" looked a little odd or something. This didn\\'t bother me too much. The show does look like your typical 90\\'s anime but there was a bit of a game changer regarding the animation because from what I\\'ve heard, This anime had not only hand-painted animation cels, but it also had computer-generated special effects which was brand new for an anime to pull something like this off. That was one thing that intrigued me concerning the animation. If the opening wasn\\'t enough, there\\'s more good stuff when it comes to this factor of an anime. The animation is gorgeous.\\nWhen it comes to music, Escaflowne was composed by two musicians. One of them was Hajime Mizoguchi and the other is Yoko Kanno (who would later be well-known for her music scores for animes such as Cowboy Bebop, Wolf\\'s Rain, and Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex. This was probably her first major hit of a music score. The score involves orchestra and trust me... This soundtrack was epic. You won\\'t be disappointed. However...Get used to hearing that name \"Escaflowne\" more often in the entire soundtrack, it\\'s a running motif.\\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, The Japanese cast is superb and terrific from start to finish. Hitomi just so happens to be Maaya Sakamoto\\'s debut role and she really makes a first impression for her voice acting talent and she would later become a big name in Japanese voice acting up to the present time. Tomokazu Seki is also pretty good as Van. Shinichiro Miki plays a great Allen. Ikue Ohtani is pretty good as Merle. Jouji Nakata is terrific as Folken, and Minami Takayama sounds like he had way too much fun as Dilandau. The standout extras in the subbed version include Juurouta Kosugi as Dryden, Mayumi Iizuka as Millerna, and the late Masato Yamanouchi as Dornkirk.\\nNow Before I get to talking about the dub, let\\'s get inside the TARDIS and travel back in time to the year 2000. Escaflowne first aired in the U.S. back in 2000, but it was short-lived.\\nThis would be commonly dubbed the \"Fox Kids\" version because there were numerous edits to each episode, it had its own exclusive opening which I don\\'t really think suits the show much. The main character focus was switched from Hitomi to Van to make the show appeal to young boys. It was cancelled because of low ratings and trust me when I say this... you\\'re better off with the show in it\\'s complete uncut form. The English dub in the FOX Kids Version was also not very good. I wish the dub could have been better when they actually dubbed the whole series because the Dub of Escaflowne has some of the worst voice acting out there and I tried really hard to get used to this dub but I couldn\\'t. The tones didn\\'t fit most of the time, some vocal tones were placed right but not acted the way it could\\'ve been and it was bad right from the first minute, it didn\\'t sound like they were trying hard enough and I immediately went to subs right after the first minute, it really was that bad of a dub, but allow me to say this. Kelly Sheridan is much better as Sango than Hitomi, Kirby Morrow is better as Miroku than Van, Brian Drummond was actually decent as Allen, Jocelyn Loewen was not that good as Merle. Paul Dobson (yes, the voice of Naraku from InuYasha) is actually decent as Folken. The lowpoint of the dub has to be Andrew Francis as Dilandau. You know what, he has had better roles since Dilandau and he is now doing the voice of Shining Armor from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.\\nMy apologies for bringing up this show, but admit it... It has become a popular show, I just so happen to like it because the humor isn\\'t stupid like I\\'m seeing in other American animated shows these days.\\nBack on topic, If you are planning on watching this anime dubbed, just go right to the subs on this one, you\\'re better off watching it subtitled than watching it dubbed. I hope someday this anime gets a re-dub, but I\\'m guessing that\\'s asking too much.\\nWhen it comes to characters, they aren\\'t really too perfect when it comes to development but this is redeemable as the show progresses. Hitomi is your average high-school girl who has a crush on pretty much anyone that looks really attractive. Understandable, she does appear to just stand in the sidelines as the conflicts are taking place (Sometimes...) But there are times where she does get involved to confront the issues that would take place. Hitomi is a not the typical \"Damsel in distress\" She is actually wriitten pretty well in an above average level. There will be a point in the series where she\\'ll realize what she is really doing and I\\'ll let you figure out the rest. Van and Allen are also interesting characters. I like some of the dynamics between Van and Allen. Folken was an interesting case as the show progressed and Dilandau was a bit delightful if you like characters that are insane. Merle is simply the sidekick for the show and I guess she was alright too. The only issue with the characters is that the main cast is developed well but some of the minor characters weren\\'t.\\nWhat makes The Vision of Escaflowne remarkable is the story. It starts off pretty decently, but as the story progresses, it gets a bit complex and it even starts being a little thought-provoking too. I was hooked after I finished watching the 14th episode of this show and I wanted to know how the show would end because it was really getting good. It did get more interesting around the second half and it did not disappoint...too much. Escaflowne was on a perfect track record until the show was on its last 3 episodes. If I heard right, Escaflowne was supposed to have a second season but the studio or whoever was behind it told the staff to end the show instead. Apparently that was the case. This all led to Escaflowne having a rushed ending. It was a good ending but the rushed pace is pretty obvious. Does that really hurt the chances of people liking the show after it\\'s done? No, it really is a fantastic series. Fantasy buffs (kinda like me) will very much enjoy the show for how much effort that was put into Escaflowne. Kazuki Akane directed this terrificly for the most part. If you haven\\'t seen The Vision of Escaflowne, then what are you doing, looking at my review? Sit down and give this show a try because I don\\'t say this lightly... It is really an anime classic that truly deserves a viewing.\\nThe Vision of Escaflowne was available from Bandai Entertainment, you know what that means... It\\'s sadly out of print. The manga by Katsu Aki was available by Tokyopop and it is out of print, Another manga named \"Messiah Knight - The Vision of Escaflowne\" never was released stateside. a third manga named \"Energist\\'s Memories\" also never made it stateside, The light novel series was also never released stateside. The Escaflowne movie was available by Bandai Entertainment, like the show, it too is out of print.\\nWith all that said, The Vision of Escaflowne is a true work of art because it wastes no second of it\\'s timeframe. The animation is gorgeous even if some people find the character designs a little odd, it has epic music, it has some memorable characters, an interesting story and pretty much anything a Fantasy buff would want to see in a classic anime. It isn\\'t perfect but it does have a very good track record.\\nI give The Vision of Escaflowne a 9.7 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\\nFeel free to leave a comment', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f82ce85ea20f595390afaab62ae98e8'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"The Vision of Escaflowne.  Es-ca-flow-nae was a beautiful and memorable fantasy adventure.  It's not a masterpiece, but it does many things right.  It throws an ordinary high school girl into a parallel universe with the earth (or the mystic moon as they call it).\\nIn this world where they call the earth (the mystic moon) and look up at night at the earth and the moon, mobile suits reign supreme and hence the nearly invincible Escaflowne which can transform.  The story was unique, but I didn't like the heavy usage of tarot cards.  On the other hand the medallion was a\\nnice introduction.  Both kind of fade out in the story as the lost city of Atlantis is introduced and understood.

The ending was still great, though shortened, and actually had a surprise or two.\\nThe characters were well developed.  What struck me most about the characters is that they all had their own motives, but none of them were pure evil.  It also showed how even good people can be corrupted, but if they have pure hearts good can come from it.  I thought it was also interesting how they included family ties and family relationships, even generational.\\nThe art and sound was above average, for the before Blu-ray era.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Escaflowne: a deeply flawed anime with undeniable qualities.\\nEscaflowne clearly suffers from its chaotic production, with the original director leaving before getting replaced by a newcomer and budget cuts bringing down the initially planned 39 episodes to only 26. This is something I actually learned after having completed the series but felt all the way. From the rushed ending, to the one note and underdeveloped characters, or the numerous loose threads... The show ends up being a jumbled mess of good but poorly executed ideas, as if the team took the story they wanted to tell in 39 episodes and tried to relate it in 26\\ninstead... except they did not want to cut anything. Narration suffers as a result and everything feels either contrived, clumsy or sometimes even irrelevant to the plot. The set-up of Hitomi coming from earth is, in fact, particularly symptomatic of this problem as it is absolutely not worth its minuscule pay-off. The same could be said for Chid (and probably for the Freid arc as a whole), Jajuka, Balgus, Atlantis, the atom bomb... Dilandau is probably the worst off in this regard: a vilain so bloodthirsty and edgy it is ridiculous with a back story that screams wasted potential (and leads to one of the few effective plot twists). Folken is a close second though. Add this to a few other problems like an annoying mascot that does not bring anything to the table, mediocre fight choreaography and a catastrophicly bad first episode and you get a nice recipe for disaster...\\nWhy 7/10 then ? Well, Escaflowne does not have the best of plots, the deepest of characters or the most flowing of narrations, but it has charm. I like the overall atmosphere of the show and I like to speculate about what it could have been. Its themes of fate, human nature, violence, pride or ambition are all worth exploring and while one could say they are not really addressed properly the show can still spark healthy reflections. I would also be remiss not to mention its beautiful old school animation. Escaflowne has a clear visual identity with vibrant colors, inspired designs (char / mech / ships / towns...) and impressive backgrounds. Yoko Kanno's score is also among the best soundtracks I have ever heard in an anime. It breathes life into scenes that would otherwise feel pretty bland, and is actually the main reason I stuck with the show in the first place.\\nWhile not being excellent Escaflowne is more than the sum of its parts and ended up being an enjoying watch despite a difficult start.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9f4d26fd7c0523e457489767c1499a69'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Perhaps this is where I admit, before I even start, that I’ve watched Escaflowne the most throughout my life. It’s because as soon as I finish watching it, I feel like watching it again right away. This is also where I admit I haven’t watched in some years now. The very first time I glimpsed it I was maybe 11-12, but I didn’t watch it because it didn’t match my school schedule, so officially I watched it when I was maybe 14-15. I don’t remember anymore because it’s been a decade since I was that age and my memory slips. I rewatched it again at\\n18-19, and since then I haven’t again.\\nNow I must say I of course watched/rewatched Sailor Moon, Saint Seiya, Marmalade Boy, CardCaptor Sakura and Dragonball the most in my life, but that wasn’t because I wanted, it was just what was available in my TV when I got out of classes. Those were also things I watched with pretty bad Portuguese dub, again because there was no alternatives. Mind you I’m not slandering them, I’m quite fond of them but I don’t much like rewatching series, just like I don’t much like rereading books.\\nSo out of my own volition, I watched Escaflowne and completely fell in love enough I watched the movie, tried discovering what else there was (pretty bad mangas, a novel and a PlayStation 1 game, I believe, without translations) because it was a magical experience to me. It’s also because of this show I became a humongous fan of Maaya Sakamoto, who sings the opening and all the songs, and Yoko Kanno, because she does kickass OST’s that’s why.\\nWhy am I saying all this? Well, I’m biased and really, super biased towards this show. That’s why （＞ｙ＜）\\nSo I’m going to say why I loved the show, why it grabbed me, and why I wished there’d been a season 2, a continuation, anything to sate my thirst for the show.\\nThe most important thing to me are characters, even in my own (private) fiction, my stories always start with characters first, and a good story will go to the shitter if it doesn’t have good characters to hold it up. And I can say that Escaflowne has very humane characters, they have flaws and make mistakes without being TSTL. Their interactions are pretty organic and grow as they know each other better.\\nThis is one of the things I very much enjoy in Escaflowne: the balance of elements are superb. Action and romance are dwelt just as masterfully as the intrigue and the world unveils before us.\\nIn my first viewing of Escaflowne I started with a big crush on Allen to then despise the cunt, and when I rewatch I find I dislike him more and love Van even more. Van and Hitomi are dual protagonists, and they’re also the ones that grow, change and mature the most throughout these 26 episodes.\\nI cried so much when it ended, and the emotional impact of this series is really focused in the ending. Mind you the mysteries leave you hanging until the end to unfold and they’re very well done.\\nI can’t praise Escaflowne enough for the balanced way which it uses plot and characters, plus all the genres, to make an amazing series that is involving, and stays in the mind of watchers.\\nI know it sounds weird I keep coming back to the balance thing, but mind you that one of the things I didn’t like in Evangelion was that the episodes sacrificed plot or characters to move forward, without a compromise. I liked Evangelion, but Escaflowne is my favourite mecha/romance/fantasy/alternate world show.\\nIt may not be a thought piece like Evangelion, that made me more depressed and gave me an existential crisis, or a masterful tale like Shin Sekai Yori that delivers on a story that grips you with mysteries. But what it does do is deliver in all the fronts that it touches upon, and this series is so good and rounded. Not in a mediocre way. It’s rounded as in there’s something of each to keep interest, be their romance lovers, mystery aficionados, or action buffs.\\nThere’s never a weak episode where I can say “you can skip and won’t lose anything” or “this episode is boring/dragging”, because those don’t happen and that’s a blessing. In a world where a lot of episodes are either enemy of the week, fodder or drag/slow, to have a show that consistently delivers? And it’s a quality story? What more can one hope than that? Because that’s all I want from my anime. I want good, excellent and superb, and I find this show is all those.\\nPlus there’s some really cool twists that will leave you with your mouth open (^_−)☆', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e398e6fbce2b8eb999e2549083e58365'}>,\n",

In the end everyone that were important to the plot were significally developed, to make the journey of the cast feel realistic and credible.\\nI m glad I watched this anime, it kept my interested till the end (the end was preditacle), so it was not a strong ending, but it wasnt a bad one too,\\nthought with more episodes to developt the anime, itself could have been more focused and less rushed, being that the only big negative about the anime, it felt it would had been better to have more time, to had story and cast evolution, to be less rushed adding a more natural pace to it, since there was stuff that they could had got a bit deeper into explaining and exploring.\\nOveral I reccomend to anyone to not get mischieved it the first looks you get when you search for more info off this anime, give it a try, the first 4 episodes, and you will see the beggining of a classic, not one of the bests at it, but surely a reminder of goold old anime times of the late 90's.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9eb1e6a5400635654518afa41b7379b0'}>,\n",

Not a single poorly written character,\\nin my opinion. I had some problems with Hitomi but she eventually grew on me. Another problem I had was with the romance. Some of the character's decisions did not make sense to me at all. Now to move on to the most important part of the show, Merle.\\nMerle is a miracle of the universe.

This is definitely not the case with Vision of Escaflowne, which virtually perfected the isekai genre long before Sword Art Online popularized the genre and made it what it is today.\\nThe best thing about Escaflowne is how gracefully the anime aged. While it didn\\'t hurt it got a remastered Blu-ray release that Crunchyroll used instead of some crap VCR rip, *cough* Futari Wa Pretty Cure *cough* the amount of detail in even something as simple as the backgrounds look\\nbreathtaking. Its reminiscent of how some modern anime like Fate/Zero or Your Lie in April blow us away with how much effort was made on the pristine details of the animation, lighting, sound, and backgrounds.\\nThe plot and characters are really great too. It doesn\\'t shy away with having characters with dirt on them, going so far to have a major protagonist involved in an affair. Like Casshern Sins and Devilman Crybaby, its cast of characters don\\'t go to waste. For example, I expected Dilandau to be a throwaway antagonist that would be killed by the halfway point. I was then shocked to find he would be a key part of the climax of the show. Conflict with internal and external forces are a key part of the show, which they fully embrace through the surprisingly good last episode. The ending of the show felt kind of rushed, in due part to the fact there was 13 additional episodes planned that got axed, and some ideas felt kind of shoehorned in, with some of Zaibach\\'s powers feeling kind of BS like \"luck blood\" and their power to control fate, and the affair I mentioned earlier doesn\\'t have as much impact as it probably should have above that \"it happened\". Nevertheless, Escaflowne does amazingly with what its got.\\nThe sound design is pristine, furthing cementing the series as an anime that refuses to age with an amazing Yoko Kanno soundtrack with such a rich orchestral sound it feels John Williams-esque, giving a boost to an already epic-feeling anime. I swear, Sunrise and Yoko Kanno in the 90s is the golden bullet that today would probably be ufotable and Yuki Kajiura.\\nOverall, Vision of Escaflowne is a series that deserves the praise it gets from fans of classic anime. It aged like fine wine from a sound and presentation standpoint and has a complex plot and characters that is miles above the genre it helped create.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"The Vision of Escaflowne is a 1996 shojo fantasy mecha series that continues to hold up more than 20 years later.\\nSTORY\\nEscaflowne is a good adventure story. It doesn't cover the deepest or most complex themes, and at times it can get a little dopey in ways that make it clear they were trying to appeal to teenage girls, but the plot keeps you engaged as the cast jumps from one dangerous situation to another. Perhaps I just had the bad luck to re-watch this series shortly after seeing the staggering amount of worldbuilding in '12 Kingdoms', but the world of Escaflowne seems rather standard. Still,\\nthat has some advantages, as I didn't have to constantly wrack my brain to remember dozens of details and the story was able to move forward clearly.\\nART & SOUND\\nDespite the fact that this show is 20+ years old, I never stop being impressed by the animation. Aesthetically, it looks magnificent. Lighting and coloring, backgrounds and character designs, all add up to a series that looks great in stills. But it's very rarely actually still, there is a great amount of movement in the animation- some scenes of Escaflowne in action are outright jaw dropping. This is top level TV animation.\\nSound is top shelf as well. Anime music legend Yoko Kanno headlines the OST, which makes considerable use of classical music and choirs. There are two English dubs of this show, a TV dub from several years ago and a recent Funimation dub- I'm referring to the Funimation dub in this review.  Caitlin Glass really hits it out of the park as Hitomi. She's able to convey her character's wide range of emotions convincingly and is backed up by a strong supporting cast- particularly Vic Mignonga as Folken, who's able to sound so different from his most famous role of Edward Elric I wouldn't have believed it was him if the credits hadn't said so.\\nCHARACTERS\\nA sign of a good character is that they can express a wide range of emotions and still feel consistent. Hitomi may seem like a basic high school girl protagonist, but she has dimensions to her character: she's as prone to crushes and emotional swings as any girl her age, but avoids going totally boy-crazy. She's has moments of fear and confusion but will still take initiative when she knows she has to. She has some abilities that keep her from being useless, but is far from being an overpowered plot-breaker.\\nI know that on a meta level, Allen and Van are there to play a 'pretty boy vs tough guy' dynamic for a female audience, but they have more than enough depth as characters to avoid just being shojo love interests.  The villains have fairly standard personalities and motivations, but they still function well enough to drive the plot forward.\\nOVERALL\\nSolid characters and stellar production values make The Vision of Escaflowne a great fantasy anime for fans of the genre and well worth a look for anime fans in general.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b3ec37ff45a68f94b19c94929e20ba7f'}>,\n",

Astonishingly, this late re-write actually works to the show's benefit, cramming a lot into little bit less space then one might expect of fantasy shows of a similar vintage like Wolf's Rain and Inuyusha.

Hitomi has reputation of being one of the most annoying characters in anime, which is not entirely undeserved on a certain level. The 'cramming' of the plot starts to come undone around episode 23, but recovers in time to produce the most beautifully bittersweet ending in anime. The cel animation doesn't hold up as well as Yoko Kanno's (Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, Macross Plus, Macross Frontier, Cowboy Bebop) brilliant music, but this is to be expected of series well over 10 years old.\\nA truly great series that demands space in any anime collection, especially fans of mecha and fantasy.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I have to admit that when I sat down for the first episode, I was quite perplexed by the mix of historical and mecha. Granted, though one of the listed genres is not “historical,” I came to think of it that way because of the world Hitomi was transported to. It’s a place where there are little towns, castles, knights… I mean, they don’t even have guns yet! But they also have air ships, cannons, and powerful robots. For about a third of the series I was kind of thrown off by it; historical mecha is cool but definitely a bit strange.\\nThe other thing that\\nis a bit weird but not that bad is that after transporting to the other planet Gaea, Hitomi does miss home, but she isn’t trying her hardest to get back right away. She’s instead distracted by what Gaea is and how the world works and what situation it’s in. For some odd reason, she’s able to understand what everyone’s saying despite it not being Japanese, something that was reflected when she met Van for the first time. A part of seems to already belong in this world. It’s a good deal different from other fantasy series where characters travel to different worlds; they’re often super perplexed, ask a lot of questions, and want to go home as soon as possible. Hitomi on the other hand takes in everything she observes and is drawn to what’s in Gaea, probably because the special pendant she carries makes her feel safe.\\nSometimes shows with mecha can be too much robot fighting and not enough of everything else. I found Escaflowne to be a good balance of both. When the fighting starts, it happens before the viewer knows why it’s going on, which is intentional. As we delve deeper into the story, we discover that the conflict arises from a struggle in power. One nation seeks to unify all for some covert reason, which people presume to believe is for dominance and nothing much else. I was quite surprised by the underlying reason, though it doesn’t come up until near the very end.\\nThe rest of the story is about Hitomi’s interactions with the other characters and their pasts. One of the knights she meets looks strikingly like her high school crush and is extremely skilled with his guymelef (the names they give to those robot battle suits). The ornery boy she met before turns out to be a prince of a small nation, and he possesses a legendary guymelef that everyone talks about. There’s a young princess that is smitten with the knight Allen. A cat girl follows Prince Van around. Allen has a cool crew with him to pilot the air ship as they move from place to place.\\nThe story-building also gives Hitomi a huge load of character development, which I love. She already comes across as a strong-willed character in the first episode, slapping Van for not caring about his own safety, not even stopping to think that she shouldn’t do such a thing since he’s a prince. If you can imagine it, she becomes even stronger. Aside from her occasional yearnings for Amano-senpai, she tries to make herself useful after finding that her tarot card readings that she did for fun on Earth actually come true on Gaea. It seems that her physical strength as a runner in high school is a bit of a catalyst for her emotional growth. If she believes in herself hard enough, thinks positively, and has faith in the ones she loves, she has a lot of power in her hands to change the world. Hitomi is definitely one of my favorite protagonists in anime.\\nAh, there’s that little shoujofied element of romance as well. If you couldn’t figure it out by now, Hitomi also has a romantic battle of the heart sometimes in the series, which is more apparent near the last episodes. There’s a particular scenario that a little bit too silly shoujo for me, but otherwise, I’m more or less satisfied with how it turned out. It makes sense for her to like Allen since he resembles Amano-senpai so much and is a gentleman, and Van is someone she admires for his unyielding character despite his hotheadedness. The romance was not a driving aspect of the story until later, which was good because it would have taken away from the adventure.\\nI have watched very few anime from the 90s, so I can’t say whether or not the animation and artwork are the greatest or not based on experience. I wasn’t a big fan of it in the beginning as I was thrown off by their long and small-pointed noses. But I think back in the day, the animation was probably pretty good. For one thing, I found that their battle sequences weren’t that hard to follow. People’s limbs are a little long, but they’re not giraffes. The robots of course were incredibly detailed, showing wear and tear while fighting and just being super-awesome looking in general. They’re not transformers, but they sure are cool.\\nI do have to say that one of the greatest aspects of this anime is the soundtrack. Never mind the opening and ending; people always talk about those and a lot of people judge the music of anime based on those. For Escaflowne they were cute, peppy, and upbeat tunes that would definitely attract the attention of the viewers. But let me talk about the actual soundtrack for a moment, the majority of which was composed by Yoko Kanno. I haven’t heard any of her music before, but after watching Escaflowne I have to say that she’s now one of my top anime composers. The piece “Dance of Curse” isn’t an OP or ED, but it definitely grabs one’s attention. In the first second you hear violinists vigorously attacking their strings, choir members chanting “ESCA-FLOWNE” in an occult fashion, and the winds and brass are desperately following along. It’s a brilliant piece that makes you think of a clash between clans, destiny being shaped, tides turning, something constantly moving, etc.\\nOf course, not the entire soundtrack is filled with similarly tumultuous instrumentals. There are of course other tracks that are more focused on the singing that seems to imitate the style of Gregorian chants, others that have lovely lyrics and even some opera voices, songs with pretty melodies that make you think of wistful daydreams, and many more.\\nMy friend told me I would be binging this series, and that was true, though not at first. In the beginning I was still feeling my way through the show, taking in the historical mecha. I like the pace of the show as well. If I wanted to binge it right away I think that would have taken away from my overall appreciation for how well it turned out. Cliffhangers are well done and not annoying, and each time I watched the episode following I instantly remembered how the last episode made me feel. I became exceptionally excited for guymelef battles. I rooted for a certain shipping. I really wanted Hitomi to be the happiest she could be and for Gaea to come to peace. I feel as if I felt everything that the producers intended me to feel.\\n“The Vision of Escaflowne” is a series that I would consider watching again, but not right away. It’s the kind of show you’d like to sit and think about after each episode or every few episodes. The characters are great and the storyline is a wonderful imagination. I don’t think I would have given this show all my attention as a child, so I’m happy I was able to enjoy it last month.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'da98e9e50d9af6dcceba99eb96264c28'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': '“I love you” is perhaps one of the most complex combination of words in the human language. It holds a special meaning for people of any age and for teenagers, that’s no overstatement. Tsurezure Children takes the idea of romance and brings it out like skits of human stories. It’s a definitely a series that I found charming and doesn’t even to be full length to show that.\\nAs a fan of the manga, I originally had mixed expectations for this adaptation. The manga has over 140 chapters and ongoing. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it would feel like the show may\\nhave some difficultly to transform this into anime form. However, the first few episodes easily convinced me that this anime has what it takes to set the bar for a rom-com. At its core, Tsurezure Children is about relationships of young people. There is quite a diverse range of characters and some of the couples really stand out compared to others. What really made me appreciate the show is how smooth the story flowed with the characters. Despite just being half length, it doesn’t waste time to showcase character pairings. It mixes character drama, humor, realism, and romance altogether.\\nThe show has a very colorful cast with all sort of characters. It has childhood friends, a tsundere, a delinquent, dominant guys, class representatives, stoic girl, drama club leaders, club members, etc. It’s like bringing together all the gimmicks you remember from high school days and stick them together. Of course, this invites all sorts of personalities into the show as well. What I find highly entertaining about the couple pairings is that all of them can be relatable. Think of your days when you were in school and the times when you had a crush on someone. If you look at the show from the characters’ perspective, it can feel like you’re there with them. And to be honest, I think that’s what makes this series really fun to watch. Romance is a very complex theme that has no real answer. Love is a very powerful emotion and this show explores that in many ways. Expect to hear confessions often and this show is not afraid to pull the trigger often between pairings.\\nDespite all the drama, the show is actually very lighthearted and comedy plays a big role to entertain the viewers. It’s very gimmicky with characters showing attraction towards each other in their pairings. Rather than forcing humor down viewers’ throats, it comes out very naturally. Individually, the characters themselves also stand out. For example, “love master” Shinchi Katori plays the role of an advisor and often gives advice related to love. Masafumi Akagi has a dominant personality and gets involved with Ryouko Kaji for his own personal reasons. Ayaka Kamine is the typical shy girl that can easily be found in most rom-coms. Her relationship with Gouda is one of the most normal ones you’ll probably notice. Kana has the role of a tsundere as she often does things that can be easily misunderstood. Chizuru Takano is the stoic girl that’s hard to notice. Saki Kanda, a member of the soft tennis club, is a normal girl with a relationship that began from a misunderstanding. The list goes on but the point is that all these characters has personalities that you’d expect to encounter at school. In one way or another, the show will easily get viewers to care about them because of their personalities.\\nNow I will admit, this show does lack a bit when it comes to storytelling. A lot of the same things happen in many episodes that can feel all over the place. Furthermore, the show feels very open when it comes to the character pairings and sometimes, it takes steps back with relationship development. Of course, this show isn’t for anyone. It has emotional drama but most of it is lighthearted comedy rather than melodrama that you may see in shoujo anime. Despite that, it’s engaging enough to keep the audience interested about the characters. It’s charming, clever, and seeks the make memories that will give viewers something to talk about.\\nWhile it doesn’t have the most impressive visuals for an anime adaptation, the show is still able to capture the essence of its themes. It’s simplistic enough to bring out character expressions and often times, it’s contagiously entertaining to watch with characters’ body language. It took me a little while to accept the art style of the show as at first, it felt lackluster. However, the more I watched, the more I realized how fitting the visuals are. It’s faithful to the manga and make the most of what it is.\\nTsurezure Children’s soundtrack also plays an important role despite being overlooked. As a show with light comedy, it often is able to match the momentum of those special moments. On occasion, those moments feels like time itself stops and the OST brings out the feel of it. Theme songs is well choreographed with j-pop themes and catchy to hear. Character voices really carries the show together as it amplifies the personalities to make them credible.\\nThis anime succeeds as an adaptation and is a terrific picture. It’s appealing and filled with personality that can easily get viewers into the mood. It’s hysterically humorous not by just its comedy aspects but by how every character pairing brings the most out from each other. While the storytelling occasionally holds the show back, it doesn’t cause its destruction because plot isn’t what this is anime is about. Rather, it takes these character relationships and makes it as whimsical as it can be. Looking for something to take mind off of and enjoy comfortably? Tsurezure Children is your answer and it doesn’t even need to be a full length show to prove it.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7b251b652624b8482c95ded59a468c16'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I'll keep this brief since this anime is not only a short but also rather straightforward in nature.\\nTsurezure Children is a very simplistic anime on paper, but also a very satisfying and surprisingly original depiction of romance. For something with merely 12-minute episodes, it's hard to find many anime better than this with similar time span.\\nTsurezure Children is almost like the antithesis of the stereotypical romance anime. Instead of having a boy and a girl clumsily dancing around each other throughout the whole anime only to get a kiss and/or a confession in the very last episode at best, in Tsurezure Children all the couples\\nare already established from the beginning in some way... and there are a lot of couples. So many I almost lost count of them.\\nEssentially it is an anime depicting various types of young couples with very different personalities in order to see how they interact and flirt with each other. It's very cute but a lot of the time also quite funny to watch. But perhaps its biggest strength is that despite how many different couples there are and how little screen time each of them has individually as a whole, they all feel extremely believable. It is easy to understand the different characters' thought processes without them feeling forced or rushed, making it feel like a very realistic anime overall. As a result, the end goal of Tsurezure Children is not to “hook up with your crush somehow” like it is in most romance anime, but rather just to portray different types of clumsy and innocent first-time relationships. It's surprising just how much of a rarity that is in anime really.\\nOverall, Tsurezure Children is a very enjoyable and genuinely refreshing romcom, and especially considering its short episode lengths it is most certainly worth spending the time on watching. And I also think the fact that a mere short managed to become one of the most popular anime of the season is by itself a testament to its success.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '32086a98773011e5c12698547ca25929'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Romance is a universal theme in the lives of many people. It’s something almost everyone must face at some point in their adolescence, whether they choose go through with it or not. How would you confess? How much do you love someone? How do you hide your crushes? What forms a successful romance? Are you shy or do you prefer to be flamboyant about it? In what ways, do you communicate with those you care about? Watch these questions and more be answered in Tsurezure Children, a playful set of comedic shorts all centered around one thing, the struggles of young love and budding relationships.\\nEach\\nepisode is only 12 minutes long, about half the length of your average anime episode, and in these shorts, there is usually 4 different stories about the hardships and struggles of young love. With 12 episodes, there are 48 different scenarios around one general subject. You might think this results in playing the same joke repeatedly but surprisingly, no. Almost every 3-minute story has its own subject matter relating to the general base to show that yes, love and early relationships are rarely handled the same way for anyone. These shorts can be about anything from awkward text misunderstandings, the aftermath of on-the-spot confessions, trying to help a friend talk to a girl, trying to say how much you like someone in a unique way, escaping the friend zone and many more. While not all of these shorts were comedy gold, and a few were kind of annoying, a majority them did get me to chuckle while watching, due to some of the character quirks and very unexpected outcome in a few more. The plots in general feel written for this format, to have a beginning, middle and end for every one and in doing that, the writing is really solid, even if the characters sometimes fail to distinguish as well as the plots.\\nThe show features a decently handled cast of those in their adolescence, with about 5-6 character pairs and two main recurring ones in every vignette. For the most part, characterization is pretty basic, with many of the plots being defined by how much a character is feeling love anxiety for another, but there are a few exceptions. The inquisitive Akagi and the incredibly flamboyant Shinichi were standouts for their more eccentric nature going beyond the simple idea of love anxiety. Props to their voice actors for making their personalities come alive. Everyone else is generally fine. They seem to act like typical teenagers with the whole “anime reaction shot” gimmicks, but are less memorable for their characters and moreso for the stories they are a part of, and towards how the animation conveys their feelings. At the same time, this is another credit to the short format of the series: that no one character overstays their welcome. If it ever gets close, you’ll shift to another pair for the comedy to continue.\\nAs far as presentation goes, it’s generally pretty light. The animation by the have-yet-to-make a mark Studio Gokumi isn’t standout, with very typical designs, colored hair, typical scene composition and face structure (with exception to Takao Yamane’s frog face), as well as the school setting. At most, it’s functional, but I won’t go too hard on it given what it wants to convey is with writing and not visual spectacle, and that it does, along with the voice acting, help in playfully exaggerating the nervous and the flamboyant personalities. In terms of music, it’s also generally typical. The OP is a basic pop tune that isn’t too memorable or exciting, background music is generally fine, but I must give credit for the handling of the ED. It is fashioned like a typical climax moment song in most romantic dramas, but the usage makes it more special than that. Rather than it having separate visuals once the plot resolves, it plays as the last scene of the episode plays out. The expressively dramatic song both helps the romantic resolutions made in each episode’s last short, and also serves to oxymoron if the scene is bombastic and silly. It’s a nice touch that makes certain scenes funnier than they would be otherwise when sending off the episodes at the end.\\nConclusion\\nIn a season remembered less than fondly by horny psycho gambling nonsense, the most boring and derivative Fate entry yet, and the insipid lewdness of Hajimete no Gal, this was a bright bulb. Not the most original or creatively animated series, but for shorts, they were very charming and pleasant.

The anime does not feature an all-encompassing conflict or story--each couple has their own path to follow. But this is carried out well; I did not feel like one couple had more or less time on screen than the others, and they were all shown often enough that there weren't any long gaps between each story.\\nArt & Sound: (7/10)\\nI put these two in the same category merely because there was not much I could say about them. The art style is very basic, not bad but not outstanding or unique, and the character designs were cute and distinct. It looks like what you would see from a typical anime. The voice acting was good and the music was enjoyable to listen to.\\nCharacter: (8/10)\\nThe characters, while not totally unique in comparison to other anime, were very entertaining to watch! Each of the couples had great chemistry with each other, even with and maybe because of their differing personalities. I was able to root for each one of them.\\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\nIt was a very enjoyable experience! Although it was brief, since the show is so short. It made me laugh on multiple occasions and was a very simple story about high schoolers falling in love. Something good if you're looking for a wholesome time.\\nOverall: (7/10)\\nOverall, I would call this an entertaining anime to watch, although if you prefer anime with more originality...I wouldn't say skip this anime over entirely, but be wary. The show featured tropes that are present in other anime (little sibling adoring big sibling, extremely oblivious girl/boy keeping the couple apart, bad girl gets with good boy, etc). The uniqueness of this anime comes from the approach to its romance rather than the characters themselves, which isn't a bad thing! It's approach was unique enough that it created a sense of distinctiveness to this anime regardless of the tropes it used.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd54b27796d06a13d05f7a237a590695d'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Another example of a brilliant short anime. The \"Love, Actually\" for otaku.\\nThe overall premise is very simple: high schoolers learning how to fall and stay in love in their own different ways. Within those different ways, though, there comes the fragmented short stories carried by different characters whose one thing in common is they all happen to be pursuing education under the same roof. Admittedly, the whole thing may seem sappy at first glance but with excellent execution, the saccharine could become something genuinely sweet-- and Tsurezure Children did just that.\\nIt is difficult to pick the best pairing out of the bunch because each pairing\\nis relatable in their own way. However, Gouda-Kamine pair does manage to be the most grounded and realistic because it deals more into what happens after the classic love confession. Chiaki-Kana pair is totally represents that hilarious phase in life on which no matter what one does, friendship can truly ruin the possibility of romance. Takao-Chiyo pair is probably the most adorable as the two of them navigate the life irony of which \"what is unlikely is not necessarily impossible\". Nonetheless, there are pairs that, unfortunately, do not deliver the equally satisfying sweetness. Takano-Sugawara pair takes more screen time than other pairs but somehow their stories ultimately feel more anticlimactic. Kaga-Nanase storyline feels exciting yet it ends very abruptly. Lastly, there is that Casanova named Katori who, as more episodes roll in, feels like he has overstayed his welcome.\\nIs Tsurezure Children a good fixture? Yes. However, the fragmented structures may not be for everyone. Like a double-edged sword, the more we as the audience invest ourselves into one of the pairings, the more we crave for longer screen time for our favorites. Funny enough, this anime truly captures the reality-- that sparks always fly all too fast and that more romance always requires more time.\\n#felixlovesanime', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5c7d98d6f4032218d4624becbd82919f'}>,\n",

The first time I was about to kiss her, I remembered a dumb joke and burst out laughing, not just killing the mood, but mutilating the corpse too.

Despite having a pretty large cast and a pretty short run time, it manages to flesh out each and every major character by giving them all this thing called personality. Each couple is in basically the same situation at the beginning of the series, and the show uses the differently personalities to drive each character in vastly different directions. By making the personalities the driving force of each story, and by using such blatant juxtaposition, the show makes you think of the characters as people, not just characters right off the bat. This is especially enforced by the framing of each story as just a snapshot into their lives rather than everything that\\'s going on with them, we can even see them sometimes in the background of other people\\'s snapshots. Because there\\'s such a variety of personalities though, it manages to cover a pretty ridiculous amount of ground, from someone being in denial about their very first crush, to their first time trying to have sex.

       "  <Document: {'content': '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\\nLove makes the world a better place.\\nSuch love can be for anyone or anything. A close family member. A good friend. A favorite pet. A passion in life. A meal on the table. Without love, we as people wouldn’t be able to enjoy each other and the things we have. So, it’s worth it to appreciate such a wonderful feeling.\\nOf course, we cannot forget about the most direct, unique love of them all: romance with a partner. That special someone in his or her life that nobody could ever replace in a million years. Tsurezure\\nChildren features such bonds basically a million times over, creating an anime that makes it easy for the audience to love back in turn.\\nSTORY\\nTsuzure Children sets itself up with the short format for its content. Its episodes run for just about thirteen minutes total, so it doesn’t have too much time to work with. However, it really only has one concept on its mind: love.\\nIndeed, this anime loves love. Thus, like an unending buffet of Valentine’s Day cupcakes, the anime fills the audience with romantic goodness in bite-size chunks that neither overstuff nor overbear. The sweet frosting promises cuteness as the characters react with full blushes and jubilation. The fluffy cake houses their lovey-dovey exchanges, ranging anywhere from playful teasing to passionate kissing. And the decorative wrapper that holds the dessert together carries comedy as “The Love Master” shares his knowledge, as a little sister attempts to stop potential progress, and as the occasional joke fills the space between those love-centric moments.\\nThese vignettes are scrumptious. But, when the local bakery displays them all at once in its front window, the larger picture surfaces: Tsurezure Children highlights how romance comes in many different shapes and sizes. One couple is just starting the whole dating scene. One couple experiences hardship that tests their relationship. One couple seems completely unlikely (from the guy’s own point of view at any rate). In other words, those cupcakes are made up of the same common ingredients, yet their final taste tastes unlike each other.\\nSimultaneously, the cupcakes look different as well – and that’s the same for the couples. Their behaviors and feelings differ among them, creating dynamics that permit new ways for the anime to showcase what love does and means. Some joke around to avoid that initial awkwardness. Some miscommunicate their meaningful intentions. Some contemplate seriously what such a relationship entails. So, much like romance, the love that blossoms within such a concept also varies in shape and size.\\nWith such constant variety, Tsurezure Children remains rather entertaining as it flits back and forth between every cupcake. While certain pairings do receive more screen time than others, and the audience will most likely have their own favorites, it isn’t too much of a stretch to deem this show as having “something for everybody.”\\nMoreover, this “something” does not just stay put with the status quo. Quite often, their small plotlines involve tangible progress for their romance and their love, turning a bunch of comedy asides into worthwhile moments for the multiple characters involved.\\nAltogether, these well-made, tasty, and varied cupcakes earn a three-star Michelin rating.\\nART & ANIMATION\\nJust as Tsurezure Children showcases tons of variety in the romance and love between the couples, it also does the same with the many designs of its characters.\\nThe colors and shading for their looks come from a bunch of areas on the rainbow that not only give them vibrant looks but also make it easier to tell them apart from one another. Plus, different depictions for their eyes, clothes, hair, and builds give them even more uniqueness amongst one another.\\nThese character designs clearly take precedence within the show. After all, with the numerous couples and the focus on interactions, their depictions become the most important part for the visuals (and subsequently the romance).\\nNevertheless, the anime incorporates other stylistic choices that drive its content. Lots of cute and funny reactions for the characters. Imaginative scenarios. A semi-infrequent all-black background. In short, the anime does what it can to spice up its presentation.\\nOtherwise, the visuals coast along without doing too much. Movement remains at least serviceable. Background artistry does not stand out. The occasional hiccup in character proportions is noticeable but not egregious. And the cinematography is at least there in some form.\\nAgain, the designs matter most, so these middling aspects of the art and the animation do not impact the show a whole lot. However, they do keep it from reaching that highest level when it comes to a critical sense.\\nCHARACTERS\\nTo sell those story cupcakes from earlier, people are needed to man the cash register and guide people throughout the store. For Tsurezure Children, those people are its characters, and they do a very good job.\\nAt roughly seven main couples, the anime does have its hands full. However, it manages to juggle them well if only because they each have their own personalities. That sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to writing believable characters, but, when fourteen (and then some) different ones exist at the same time here, and the show itself only has so much time in which to involve them, their ability to feel like their own person is not so easy to accomplish.\\nThankfully, Tsurezure Children achieves such an outcome, crafting characters that have personal quirks, actions, and motivations that give them a foothold of their own to stand on throughout the season. For example, Jun is a very serious person who does not rush into a situation (let alone a relationship) without careful thought. Chizuru is quiet and kind but a bit too naïve when it comes to love. Yamane is ugly (according to himself), and he greatly appreciates his friendship with his buddy Motoyama. Ayaka is actually a lot needier than at first believed.\\nMore importantly, though, these characters grow from the romance and the love that the share between each other. Take Kyouko. Akagi influences her enough to become a better person all around. She stops smoking. She values herself more. She pursues her studies in earnest. Chiaki is another strong example. He puts aside his silliness to declare what he cares about most: Kana and their relationship. Simply put, he comes to understand that she means more to him than any kiss ever could.\\nWhile the characters and their dynamics keep those cupcakes flying off the shelves, Tsurezure Children unfortunately loses a few employees along the way. Kanda and Takase do not see a proper resolution to the awkward confession and tension built between them. Also, the show seemingly forgets about the set of characters from or related to the astronomy club for no real reason.\\nDespite these tiny mishaps, the cast still differentiate themselves throughout the season, and their romances allow them to grow in tangible ways. A set of positives that make their efforts in the bakery worthwhile.\\nMUSIC & SOUND\\nMuch like the artistry, Tsurezure Children puts the most care for its audio into the characters with very solid voice acting for each of them. While nearly every role strikes at cuteness or fun, without a doubt the best performance comes out of Haruka Tomatsu as Hotaru.\\nShe only has a couple of scenes, but her introductory one turns into something arguably memorable. Different pitches, emotions, and noises in the span of almost three minutes demonstrate her skill and boost the execution of the anime.\\nBeyond the VA performances, the music rests comfortably in the passable category. The opening track “Aimai Moko” is a nice little song whose acoustic guitar, chimes, eventual violins, and cheerful tone follow the anime’s own lighthearted feel.\\nSimilarly, the ending track “Dear” leads the audience out of each episode with a gentle pull as a slow vocal delivery and soft piano keys ring out in the background. And the rest of the original soundtrack goes for daintier instrumentation for both its comedic and dramatic segments, giving the show’s scenes a stronger foundation to stand upon.\\nIn total, the OP, the ED, and the OST are collectively one of the weaker parts of the show, but the VA performances rise above its average brethren. Ensuring that the audio quality of Tsurezure Children does not fall into anywhere unfavorable.\\nENJOYMENT\\nRomance is my jam, and this anime was jam packed with romance. So, naturally, I quite liked it.\\nEach couple brought something new to the table that got me smiling on my face and giddy in my soul. Ryouko and Akagi had a lot of maturity as they bullied and quarreled with each other. Kana and Chiaki synchronized their antics and worked hard to push their relationship forward. Ayaka and Takeru shared their thoughts and wants openly to deepen their connection.\\nAnd that’s not even half of them. Kanda and Takase overjoyed while texting. Chizuru trying to come to terms with her feelings for Sugawara as he tried to make his for her known. Motoyama supporting Chiyo and Yamane like a true bro. And Yuki teasing Jun constantly as Hotaru tried to interfere. Essentially, I was rooting for every couple’s success, and I was laughing with happiness while doing so.\\nI also really appreciated the kindhearted atmosphere. Yes, tiny conflicts popped up on a rare basis, but the content made sure to take on a positive spin as much as it could. I didn’t have to worry about anything mean going down, and it was obvious that, if any problems did arise, they would inevitably correct themselves in the best way possible. This atmosphere, combined with the fun couples and their awesome romances, made this show a super-fun experience.\\nTsurezure Children is a short anime with a lot to offer. The focus on love for its story and its characters create many a heartfelt, comedic moment for the audience to like. And the audiovisual design, while not too impressive, has its spare shining qualities as well. This concluding description is just one of the million ways in which to give this project praise.\\nSUMMARY\\nStory: Great, an unending buffet of yummy Valentine’s Day cupcakes\\nArt & Animation: Good, the different, colorful character designs take precedence over the interesting stylistic choices and other passable aspects of the visual presentation\\nCharacters: Good, the members of this very large cast have distinct representations even with the short runtime, and their romances allow them to grow for the better, but focus on specific ones is lost along the way\\nMusic & Sound: Fine, some nice VA performances carry the audio forward as the OP, the ED, and the OST watch from the sidelines\\nEnjoyment: Great, jam packed with romantic goodness\\nFinal Score: 8/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'eb7ffa85c95283298432bacab9afd129'}>,\n",

Kinda confusing but.. It's anime. I personally loved how they put the romance and humor in balance on every plot.\\nArt: 9/10\\nI judge art not that much to be honest. If the art is pleasing enough for my eyes, it will be worth it until the end. The art on this anime is an extravagant one. The effects, the blush on the romance scenes, the short effects on joke scenes. All intimidating and gorgeous. Though I get the feeling, on my opinion that this art is only 9/10 due to the fact the feeling of lacking can be there sometimes.\\nSound: 8/10\\nOpening is good.. Not that much my taste though what makes the sound 8/10 is that before the anime ends, the song plays already, making the sound more fitting to the side of romance.\\nCharacter: 9/10\\nWe are introduced by so many characters on the spot! That is actually a huge problem, but when you watch like 2 or 3 more episodes, this problem fades away like a bird flies away at a distance. All because of the anime's great character development. We get to know their traits more and more, along their reaction to one another.\\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\nI'm not a fan of romance that much but when you consider a romantic anime that is enjoyable, its sides of humor can be considered also along with some plot twists and intense ones. Tsurezure offers us alot of them and its surprising that a 12-minute only anime can give so much that you can scream because of the romance, or laugh because of its cliched scenes and all.\\nOverall... 8/10 will be my rating since the story is not that much, I can say that its purpose of the story really lived up to the heights of a normal human like me.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2a055df74b36b880580d11a200d4963d'}>,\n",

This is about an extremely heart warming anime through and through that was, as I said before, sweet, hilarious, and enjoyable.\\nTsurezure Children focuses on the concept of young love and how it affects adolescence. While not all of the romance was great and the writers definitely made it more dramatic than it actually is, it\\'s still an anime that is worth attention for all romantic comedy fans!\\nStory - 7:\\nAll I can say about the story is...they\\'re all about love. That\\'s right, \"they\\'re\". Tsurezure Children story isn\\'t\\njust one story but a bunch of stories happening at once! They weren\\'t anything monumental, but I can safely say that each story had personality with each situation being much different from the last! It definitely kept me engaged through and through. I was smiling, laughing, and cracking a few jokes here and there all from enjoyment! Of course, not all of the stories were great, but I\\'ll go in depth about my feelings once we get to the character section.\\nOne thing I\\'ll say is that some the stories were definitely forgotten. Ones appearing for one episode, have little screen, and never showing up again for the rest of the series. I guess the other romances were able to hold me over, but I would have really appreciated it if we went more in depth with some of these tales. The 12 episode limit is a pain, huh?\\nOverall, the story or stories of Tsurezure Children are nice, relaxing, and hilarious to watch. Maybe hitting you in the feels here and there.\\nArt - 9:\\nThe artstyle while simplistic still turned out to be very eye catching to me. Character\\'s expressions were drawn very well, being able to evoke so much emotion, as they should be. Not much else I can say. The artstyle of this anime is an A+ in my book!\\nSound - 7:\\nThe music wasn\\'t bad either. A relaxing, but soothing tone in each song fits perfectly with the show\\'s theme. The opening had a real upbeat attitude to it, letting you know immediately that it\\'ll contain a lighter tone throughout the anime. Overall, music to my ears!\\nCharacter - 7:\\nWhile the characters weren\\'t anything special themselves, most of them were a joy to watch! Thanks to their varying personalities, each character always brought life from within my laptop\\'s screen and the comical moments involving them were priceless, especially Katori, which I wish we got to know more about since he\\'s always bringing a dramatic but fun attitude to what\\'s currently going on. Most of them were very relatable as well. Some being extremely nervous and questioning their next actions which I can wholeheartedly relate to!\\nSpeaking of wanting to see more of characters, some were completely abandoned unfortunately. Going back to what I said about the story, it felt like the staff making this were trying to put as much of the characters from the manga in as possible, but either left them alone after their debut episode or didn\\'t appear at all. Also, I never read the manga. I did take a glimpse at a volume and noticed two characters that weren\\'t in the anime at all! Hell, two characters who were in the opening for 12 straight episodes didn\\'t appear until the final episode, but didn\\'t provide them with their own story! It kinda felt like they were just shoved in there and hopefully it\\'ll all work itself out. It did...to an extent and at a point where I wish we could see more of those two and other characters not shown in the anime.\\n**THIS IS WHERE I GET TO SPOILER TERRITORY! IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE READING, SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU REACH ANOTHER CAPPED SENTENCE WITH TWO STARS NEXT TO IT LIKE THIS ONE**\\nTwo characters who kind of pissed me off a little were the first couple introduced in the very first episode; Haruhiko Takase and his female heroine Saki Kanda. As seen in the episode 1, Saki accidentally confessed her feelings to Haruhiko right before moving on to the next couple. Now you can\\'t tell me Haruhiko was dense as fuck because he obviously took notice. Haruhiko, she LIKES you! You KNOW that now! You LIKE her as well! CONFESS TO HER! Next time we see them, it\\'s like nothing ever happened and I don\\'t get it! WHY DIDN\\'T ANYONE MAKE A MOVE?! The author definitely dragged this out more than he actually needed to because he already established their love for each other and one of them just blurted it out, but the other is not doing anything about it and acted like nothing ever happened! What\\'s worse, THEY NEVER GOT TOGETHER! This couple was a complete, misunderstood, mess! Most likely, this relationship goes deeper in the manga, but until I\\'ve read that, this was definitely my least very story out of all the others in here.\\n**SAFE! YOU MAY PROCEED READING TO MY REVIEW! HOPE YOU\\'RE HAVING FUN! :D**\\nAnyways, most of the characters were a treat to watch. Some were greatly developed and others were either severely underdeveloped, very poorly executed, or just gone like an irrelevant thought. Hopefully this gets a season 2 because I\\'d love to see more of these amazing characters, new additions, and improve others who I weren\\'t so fond of.\\nEnjoyment - 8:\\nThis is my 2nd time watching this anime and I still absolutely love it! It was funny, heart warming, and little bit emotional at times. Even showed some life lessons hidden within some of the stories like trying hard will get you somewhere and draw others to you or don\\'t force anything or it\\'ll all come crashing down, etc. I\\'m not sure what else I can say about this anime. Everything was such a pleasure to watch!\\nOverall:\\nTsurezure Children is an awesome anime with memorable characters, fantastic moments, and will leave you missing every single element within it. Definitely recommend it if you\\'re into romantic comedy, but if you also want an anime you can quickly binge watch, this is good too! Each episode is only 12 minutes long!\\nI\\'m praying this gets a season 2! I want to see more of these characters grow and see how their stories end, because some were surely left unfinished.

In Toradora, as with many anime it takes the main characters forever to realize and express their true\\nfeelings (although tbh that was great, like how good is Toradora?).\\nBut typically, the characters in romance anime can be infuriating in the way they approach their feelings. What Tsurezure children does well is that it does not leave you to perish with a sinking ship that is a painfully slow romantic development.\\nAllow me to elaborate because so far this review sucks. I promise it might get better.\\nThere are such a wide variety of characters in Tsurezure Children that you are bound to find ones you like. Although for me it was the case that I liked almost all of them, but BECAUSE the cast is so large I was bound to find ones I did not like.\\nIf you are someone who likes quick development in a relationship, there's a couple for you.\\nIf you prefer a long, drawn out development with lots of slip ups and painful misunderstandings, there's a couple for you.\\nIf you like the loli-esque shy girl who underestimates how kawaii she is but slowly gains the confidence to address the feelings she has about a boy in her class, there's a couple for you.\\nIf you like the loudmouth tsundere who really just wants to tell the boy she cares about how she feels but can't bring herself to do it in a way that isn't off-putting, there's a couple for you.\\nIf, for some reason you like the nerdy kid who refuses to believe any girl will ever love him and freaks THE FUCK OUT whenever he talks to anyone of the opposite gender, unfortunately there's a couple for you.\\nThe point is, the major variety seen in Tsurezure children is what makes it so damn great. There's something for everyone to enjoy. But it doesn't get a 10 from me because there is also something for everyone to hate.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4ae9da272ae1184b13afc0fe1bc9c261'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"STORY - 9\\nART - 8\\nSOUND - 6\\nCHARACTER - 9\\nENJOYMENT - 9\\nSee, the thing about young love is that it brings out our inexperienced selves. Many of us turn into an awkward, flustered, and cringey bundle of foolishness because we have no idea how to initially go on about a relationship, but despite the embarrassments, lovebirds will try to make their relationship work together. That's the part that touches me the most and Tsurezure Children shows us just how endearing that quality is.\\nA simple change on a fluffy anime genre is all you need to describe the heart of the show: Cute Couples Doing Cute Things.\\nRomantic\\nlove is multifaceted as there is virtually a limitless number of ways two people can fall in love with each other. It's the reason why love is such a complex thing, and Tsurezure Children manages to explore the diversity of this powerful emotion in a very heartwarming way. Rather than focusing solely on one couple, we are quickly introduced to several ones. It might have been a recipe for disaster to have a large variety of pairings in a short anime, but thankfully, the show understands how to treat every relationship with light care. Each episode delves right into the many ways romance can affect different couples, and because of this constant switching of perspectives, the wide assortment of lovey-dovey exchanges leads to an engaging story. Really, it's a simple show, but the fact it knows how to keep itself dynamic and fresh at all times—with a healthy dose of cuteness—makes it easy to indulge in its light-hearted atmosphere.\\nAs playful as the show is, there are also some angst and mild drama to be found here. Remember, young love can be a constant struggle because of this thing we call inexperience, so it's obvious not every relationship will be smooth sailing. It might be frustrating to see some of the couples seemingly return back to their status quo when you know their infatuation for each other is strong enough they should just get married already, but it's all part of the reality the show wants to communicate to us; the things that love can entail to young people including the problematic sides. Setbacks can happen in a relationship and Tsurezure Children is not afraid to show that, which makes the experience even better when the characters learn from their mistakes to develop further. For the most part though, the show is like a velvety wedding cake with a great comedic flavor and enough sweet personality to die for—all of which are the ingredients of enjoyment.\\nAnd just like the simple narrative elements, the audiovisual lies in the same basic spectrum too—but it works for a show like this. You can easily distinguish every character even with their straightforward designs and the visual is fluid enough to capture the feelings of being love-struck. The soundtracks, on the other hand, are really light they're honestly forgettable, but the voice-acting is a lovely accompaniment to the vast amount of personality, whether it's for the comically flamboyant or the awkwardly shy.\\nSo, all things considered, Tsurezure Children is an ideal anime for those looking to enjoy some young love appeal in the form of a short rom-com. It's heartwarming yet believable at the same time, and the diverse range of relationships works to unite the complex feeling we call romantic love into a simple heart-shaped sweetness. Seeing all the affection bloom in this show has definitely been a pleasant experience.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9fc8d0cac62f0c432569a44df12bf10a'}>,\n",

In general, it is the story of a very large cast of high school student's experiences with love across a series of story threads. There's some cross over here and there as is natural for stories occurring at the same school, but for the most part these stories are completely separate. Furthermore, these stories aren't told all at\\nonce, but rather each episode is divided into multiple parts each focused on a different story. This helps pacing significantly, in that it allows stories of different types to be interspersed such that they balance each other out, and furthermore just in general help things seem faster than they would otherwise which helps considering that a lot of the time nothing much happens and in general stories focused around the same couple are pretty similar and hence their stories overall are pretty repetitive. As for the stories themselves, they were pretty varied within the confines of what would be reasonable for such a premise, and in terms of quality were somewhat of a mixed bag as well. Some were good. Some were great. And some were only okay. None were completely bad though. Though there were some that felt incomplete, in that they either started but then disappeared without getting any sort of conclusion, or just sort of appeared out of nowhere in a way that was somewhat confusing.

Tsurezure Children does a spectacular job of being a romance anime, and it does the audience a favour by shaving off all the unnecessary roundabouts and extra boring tidbits and surges straight to the good juicy moments of romance and fluff that we all came for.

two people discover feel their pulse quicken when being near the people they want to spend time with.\\nStory: Tsurezure Children follows a rotating cast of characters where each of its twelve minute long episode is split into three parts, each part focusing on a different couple or in some cases, successive parts that focus on the same pair.\\xa0 With it, the show gives off a sense of progress as each couple grows closer to each other and gives the viewer a\\nvariety of stories varying from those that lead up to the typical confession scene in most romance shows, or show us the rockiness or steadiness of different relationships given the two parties involved.\\xa0 As a result, the show is quite varied and despite the flipflop, feels like it has more to it due to the progressive feeling of the show.\\nThe one downside for the story however is how a good number of the couples really don\\'t get that much screentime.\\xa0 More than half of all of the featured couples in this show are barely given any attention, so it becomes awkward to watch when you\\'re following one couple and their story for the past two weeks, but all of a sudden, these people who haven\\'t gotten any mention since episode two show up and suddenly get a bit to themselves.\\xa0 The imbalance is quite clear towards the end of the series, and it\\'s a bit of a disappointment cause some of my more favorite couples are those that didn\\'t get much attention at all.\\nOverview:\\n+ Varied show with a sense of progress\\n-\\xa0 Heavy imbalance with the presentation of some couples\\nCharacters: Honestly there is no way you\\'re gonna remember the characters.\\xa0 At least a majority of them.\\xa0 More than anything, the show sets them up in such a way that should you forget their names, the interactions with their partner are recognizable enough for you to remember which couple is being featured at a given time, something that was quite common for me because the later episodes pretty much focused on only two to three of the total eight or so couples in this series.\\nThe imbalance with the stories becomes painfully clear when Gouda and Kamine or Kana and Chiaki become the only centerpieces the show is willing to focus on.\\xa0 (Maybe Sugawara and Takano too.)\\xa0 I remember those names specifically because the show liked to focus on their story so much that they completely disregarded the astronomy girl or even the couple who had the first scene in the whole series without batting an eye.\\xa0 Indeed while some of the lesser stories got enough attention to fulfill some kind of small saga, and others are larger in detail and require more time for an overarching story, I can\\'t help but shake the feeling that things could\\'ve turned out better with better screentime balance.\\nOverview:\\n+ Large cast of still recognizable characters\\n-\\xa0 Imbalance becomes painfully clear later on in the series (I only remember about half of the couples\\' names by heart.)\\nArt: Produced by Studio Gokumi, Tsurezure Children bears a simple style with bold and easy colors complimented by the cartoonish nature of the character designs.\\xa0 While the art quality itself isn\\'t that amazing, it\\'s the character designs that\\'s the art\\'s selling point.\\nEvery character is defined in both hair color and hair design.\\xa0 Personally I think this is a really good way of distinguishing a large cast because during the switch to a different story, the couples\\'s hair color ends up becoming the main indicator for the audience as to who we\\'re focusing on since pretty much everyone has a different style or color to their hair, making us think \"Oh, this couple\" rather than struggling to remember their names and what quirk they have.\\nOverview:\\n+ Simple yet bold artstyle\\n+ Different hair colors makes couple distinguishing easy (Probably overthinking it, but it\\'s my theory.)\\nSound: Performed by Inori Minase, the show\\'s OP \"Aimai Moko\" is a cheerful and happy song that despite sounding good, isn\\'t really all that memorable if I may be honest.\\xa0 There\\'s nothing about it that screams memorable and honestly wasn\\'t a song that appeared in my radar.\\xa0 The rest of the soundtrack I feel is the same way so there\\'s really nothing special to note here.\\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite the imbalance, Tsurezure Children was a fun watch.\\xa0 It had all of the elements of a bunch of different romance anime without cluttering itself because the show always focused on only one story at a time.\\xa0 I admit I was mildly annoyed by how the show only just told the story of two of the existing couples.\\xa0 Especially because there were so many others who were just as deserving of that screentime but didn\\'t get the time of day to really show a lot of progress.\\nDid I like this anime?\\nMore specifically, I like Hanakana\\'s character, Minagawa.\\xa0 Her and Furuya were my favorite couple out of the lot and I\\'m so sad that they didn\\'t get more screentime.\\xa0 It was fucking gold and I wanted more.\\xa0 Why didn\\'t you give us more?!\\nWhat didn\\'t I like about this anime?\\nHonestly, Gouda and Kamine\\'s relationship is...boring.\\xa0 Or at least the show made it boring.\\xa0 Every time they came on, it was the exact same thing with not much progression to move things along.\\xa0 Puppy love is cute and all, but if you\\'re not gonna do much with it, you might as well give the screentime to a couple who needs it.\\nWould I recommend this anime?\\nIf you want something cute, Tsurezure Children is a really good fit.\\xa0 It fits along a broad spectrum of different romance stories and packs them all in a neat little series that works surprisingly well despite having eight or so different stories happening at once.\\xa0 Indeed the imbalance is annoying and your favorite couple might not get the time of day, but the show is still fun and enjoyable to watch, so I would recommend it.',

It is rare to spend a lot of time watching this anime without giving at least some good laughs.\\nThe anime has EXCELLENT characters, well-crafted personalities and more realistic than in many anime, as well as situations extrapolated purposely, but that could happen or happened in their\\nadolescence! That's why we ended up creating an ID with some stories and we got there hoping that everything works out for the couples!\\nTsurezure Children aims to be simple, fun and at the same time daring, and fulfills everything it promises!

Por isso acabamos criando uma identificação com algumas histórias e nos pegamos torcendo pra que tudo acabe bem para os casais!\\nTsurezure Children tem a proposta de ser simples, divertido e ao mesmo tempo ousado, e entrega tudo que promete! É o melhor anime de comédia romântica que eu já assisti! Por isso, nota 10.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2f9999d11938a0c399d6f6534c5418b8'}>,\n",

The constant swapping from one character to the next keeps the pace light and comedy fresh, as you never get too tired of one couple before they introduce the\\nnext.\\nFor the most part, I liked almost every single character in the anime, and could find myself relating and investing myself into their struggles. If anything, the worst part of the show is that some of the characters don't receive enough time in the spotlight, and are kind of dropped as the series goes on.\\nYet, the show provided enough closure and happiness for my favorite pairings, and I ended up with a dumb grin on my face as I finished it so I can't help but recommend the show to anyone looking for something lighthearted, funny, or cute.

They break up each 10min long episode into shorter mini-stories that link to each other via different episodes. I thought this was weird at first, but it actually helped he storyline since you got to see all of the couples in each episode rather than just\\none or two.

While it isn’t as good as other series, this is likely due to the series not being heavily fanservice focussed or art focussed, which I perceive to be a good thing. It is still great nevertheless.\\nSound: 6\\nProbably the only thing I can really fault with the series. The OST was ok, but other than that, the music wasn’t really obvious/audible. Nothing wrong with it in particular though.\\nCharacter Developmet: 10\\nPretty much the purpose of the anime was to explore characters going through the phases of love. It is very reminiscent of a time when I fell in love, and is definitely something that contributed to the series being so great.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsurezure Children\\nMixed feelings about this one. Its light-hearted attempt at depicting couples teaching each other the meaning of love is too brief. The show in general is very shallow. From the beginning we’re being introduced to, like what, ten to fifteen characters that navigate through high-school with this intent to ship themselves with someone: be it a long-time crush; a very close friend; or some acquaintance they just met by chance. I’m not buying into the premise. Worst yet, for a RomCom, none of the writers and/or producers found it appropriate to deal with rejection. They couldn’t be bothered with such topics i guess, as\\nevery single confession in this show was met with a positive response (there was one exception but that scene was dreadful). Which further secures my impression that Tsurezure Children lacked depth, or any other dimension for that matter.\\nGuys let’s start pointing out the elephants in the room here. Number one, this show is episodic. There’s no timeline. To that, no sense of progression: nothing is really being done. Secondly, the show deals with the goodness of loving relationships but the evolution of it is cut short. The show spreads itself too thin. Think about it...12 episodes; each 13 minutes in length for a dozen characters? Why set yourself up for failure? My guess is the writers thought it clever to “re-invent the wheel” here by providing for a narrative that tries itself different from the normal format used in RomComs. Nice try laddies, now try again. Given its limited airtime, and the lack of continuity from episode to episode guess what else the show lacked completely? Any form of interaction between the couples and the world around them. The series provides us with isolated incidents where only the two members of every couple actively participate; everything else around them stands still in the meanwhile.\\nFor positivity however, I must concur that the show does provide for good humour. It’s funny and it made me laugh quite often. There was something to admire about the naivete these children demarcated, paired with their general awkwardness. The show made it interesting enough to show value in some regards, while creating disappointment in others. Although I might be bummed out by what Tsurezure clearly lacked, it was refreshing to take a scenic tour appreciating the simpler things that such anime series can offer. Moreover, some of the scenes, outside of being entertaining to watch, depicted some flare of marvel, however short lived it might have been. Whomever is keen enough to peer through all 12 episodes will come to find that the people having created this show are no amateurs. Which further makes me wonder why they didn’t take a leap further towards developing something that could have been more complete and substantive.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'be6fcfacfb1714fb0925aca624eb5d67'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Tsurezure Children is something you watch just to feel good. The story is decent, but definitely not a masterpiece. What really captures the audience is the great characters and how intriguing their relationships are. My personal favorite relationships are with Chizuru + Takurou and Takera + Ayaka. Chizuru is a very cute, sweet girl who thinks that she isn't worth anything. This is really bad for Takurou because he is hopelessly in love with her, leading to so many misunderstandings. Takera is oblivious to everything Ayaka does, but he's really sweet and she's so adorable. I fell in love with these couple almost right away.\\nThe\\nrelationships do fall into some cliches, but many of them are hilarious and relatable in some way or another.

       "  <Document: {'content': '[TL;DR: Short, sweet, with some nice humor. A story about young love, told through many different couples and situations. Great story bits stringed together haphazardly in a trope-storm, that results in one of the most unique rom-com installments I watched to date. Art and sound is bland, but the story makes up for it. Binge it, or you\\'ll lose track of the many characters!]\\nA story must have a beginning, a middle and an end, or so they say. Well, Tsurezure Children has...none of those. Rather, it\\'s basically five or so separate rom-com stories stitched together to form a sort of Franken-anime, where characters from one\\nstory are the support cast in the other stories, and it all forms a hot mess that somehow...works!\\nThe only common thread in the story is that the characters all go to the same school. You\\'ll find pretty much all the usual tropes: the student council prez, the cool one, the shy one, the delinquent, the nerd, the tsundere (of course), the childhood friend, the clueless, the class clown, etc. The pairings might look weird, but that\\'s the thing, love does not supposed to make sense. If two people love each other, they find a way to make it work...usually.\\nThe stories start off at different stages of the rom-com timeline. Some start with the confession, and they try to work out how relationships supposed to work, some start with a vague hint of \"do I really like him/her?\", and everything in-between. This might be a tad confusing at first, and I can\\'t say it gets easier. You really have to pay attention to what happens, or it\\'s easy to lose track or what\\'s going on. The series is also pretty short, only 12 episodes with 12 minutes of runtime each (including the OP and ED).  That\\'s woefully too little to cram this much content into, so the pacing is all over the place. It\\'s all straight to business, everything not absolutely necessary has been cut. It\\'s the \"filet mignon\" of rom-coms. Bite-sized bits of love and fun without all the fluff. Just the characters and their love life, no establishment shots, no scenery, no long gazes into each other\\'s eyes, no pauses for effect, ain\\'t nobody got time for that! This makes for very thick and exhilarating episodes with basically no downtime or boring parts, but it also negates two of the most crucial elements of romance and comedy: buildup and timing. One of the key components in making a story like this, is the careful buildup and release of romantic tension and the timing of comic relief. You mess any of that up, and you story\\'s gonna be sub-par. All of that is kinda absent in Tsurezure Children, with the story making you fill in the implied parts, which makes the whole thing feel rushed and unfinished. This is one series that would\\'ve definitely deserved either a full season of 24 episodes or a much longer runtime.\\nThe art and sound suffered the same fate. Don\\'t get me wrong, the anime is far from bad, but it\\'s also far from great as well. It\\'s nice, easy to look at and basically functional, but that\\'s that. Romance is the one genre that benefits exceptionally well from carefully constructed visuals, beautiful art and awesome music/VO. Instead, Tsurezure Children operates with bland pastels, lots of still shots, talking heads, and forgettable background noise. While the stories would be great in themselves, I feel the creators didn\\'t really have the time and/or the budget to really bring out the real quality this would\\'ve deserved. It\\'s a real shame.\\nAll in all, Tsurezure Children is a nice bit of rom-com with a unique way of storytelling. A bit rushed and lackluster in some areas, but it\\'s full of personality and content. If you like romance with tons of characters, lots of different perspectives and a no-nonsense full-tilt gait, Tsurezure Children is a great one to binge on a boring afternoon!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'eabdeb8d3a9a7b66c11b73365c242ebf'}>,\n",

Tsurezure suffers from having too many main characters, which a lot of shows suffer from, but usually not this heavily. If you don't know already, each episode is around 12 minutes, and there are 12 episodes so far in the series. The amount of actual time that this show has is not NEARLY enough to flesh out the amount of characters it has, making each character not really have much of a personality, and making it hard to make\\na connection with any characters. That being said there are likable characters, in fact all of the characters are likable, their just unfulfilling.\\nStory(7): There are multiple stories in this show, and each one of them is good; however, each story is basically developed in the same way. Because each story gets so little screen time, it's hard for us to care about what's happening. Nonetheless, each story is at least a little unique, and fun to watch.\\nArt(9): I don't know much about art, but I can tell you that this is very easy on the eyes. It's a little too bright for my tastes, but is still nice to look at.\\nSound(7): The voice acting is pretty good, and so is the sound editing. Unfortunately the music is not. I don't know why but A LOT of anime seem to use basic triads, and the same chord progression, (which is common in modern music) but it's still just dull listening to it.\\nCharacter(5): Worst and Best aspect of the show. The reason to watch Tsurezure Children, if not the art, is the variety in the characters. However, like I said already, too much variety can be a bad thing. Each character is likable, but at the same time paper thin. There's not really any depth. I understand that is kinda what the show is going for, but it makes it hard to make a connection to the characters and to the story.\\nEnjoyment(8): Despite all my criticism's, there is not a moment in the show that I am bored, and there is not a moment I don't enjoy.

Fortunately, the series comes with a variety of pairings and at least one of which have struggles that connects to us, speaks to our inner romantic, and demands our investment.\\nThe couple may be set and the shipping arguments laid null, but there’s always a little something for everyone: a couple or two whose journey you would prefer the most.\\nI’ll keep this review short and sweet, much like the series.

The show goes directly into rapid fire mod and introduces us to couples after couples right off the bat, although this may sound negative it turns out to be a rather enjoyable and successful formula. However, if you have watched any romance or comedy (that has some romance) show in general, then you have most likely already seen most, if not all, of the possible situations that\\nthe couples in this series are put in.  The “problems” they face range from the couple being shy to being immature or even naïve at times, and like other romcom anime, characters would sporadically be placed in “embarrassing” situations.\\nThe score that I gave the show by no means reflects the enjoyment that I had watching it. If I am to rate it solely based on enjoyment, it would be much higher than what I have written, because the series never failed to make me smile or make me feel relaxed; however, I had a few problems with it. The foremost being the characters, this is probably the first time I have ever finished a show without remembering the names of any of the characters. I never really cared to actually know what their names were, to begin with; most will argue that “It’s just a series of short gimmicks, you aren’t supposed to emphasize on who’s who”. Well I mean yeah sure, but at the end of the day, that makes the show lose a lot of its value (to me at least) because I will easily forget about it soon enough. Moreover, I don’t know why I could not binge watch the series, meaning I could not get myself to watch more than two episodes in a row despite the show being rather short (I waited till the show approached its end before I started watching it). Normally that would actually be a good thing because it would mean I am “brooding” over it, but in this case, I just felt I was getting an overdose of “wish-fulfilling pre-teen love”.\\nDespite everything, I really enjoyed the show and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a rather “heart-warming” experience.

They\\'re (in my opinion) the most enjoyable anime series to watch, since there is usually no plot heavy story, its comedy (obviously), and it only takes 12 minutes, so you can watch it if you only have a small bit of time to kill.\\nOnto the real review!!\\nStory - 8\\nDespite the\\ncreators having to stuff the stories of multiple individual couples into 3-4 minute bits, they really did a good job with it. They made easily rememberable situations, and had the characters interact with each other brilliantly.\\nI really wish we could have seen more of the love stories though, I wish it would have been 24 episodes instead of 12 ):\\nArt - 6\\nThe art wasn\\'t anything too special in my eyes, it was pretty average. There isn\\'t much to say about it, since there wasn\\'t anything extremely great, or terrible.\\nSound - 6\\nLike most series, I never stop to listen to the sound, so I can\\'t comment on it. My surplus of \"There isn\\'t much to say\" won\\'t be leaking out in this review anymore, so enjoy it while it lasts.\\nCharacter - 10\\nYou know how sometimes you can take one look at a character and immediately know what they will be like? After watching the OP in episode 1, I knew how the majority of the relationships would be. And God, was I wrong! It was better than what I had expected! I really enjoyed seeing characters with unique personalities interacting with each other, instead of cardboard cutouts being desperate over each other.\\nI\\'ll be honest, I don\\'t remember a single one of their names (Would you expect me to? Going through Danganronpa is hard enough for names). However, I did give them some nice nicknames! Here is my list :\\nRyouko - Fluffy Delinquent\\nShinichi - Happy Usui Takumi\\nYuki - Droopy Face\\nTakao - Female Tsu-chan\\nEnjoyment - 10\\nThis has to be one of my favorite anime series, I\\'m glad I took a break from watching Isekai anime to watch this gem. I have a really soft and weak spot for Romance anime, and I like humor (since I\\'m not dead), put that along with short and easy to watch episodes and you get a big fat like from me!\\nOverall - 8\\nFrom now on, I\\'m going to recommend this to people who are either new to anime, or don\\'t have anything to watch.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Tsurezure Children is another addition to the \"short but sweet rom com\" shows like Rainbow Days and even the Chinese \"Aishen qiaokeli.\" It focuses on fast pacing without the drama and buildup of a relationship. In a sentence, it\\'s progression that\\'s so quick that it spares readers the buildup to how the relationship truly began, or sometimes cuts and crunches that into a very dense and short bit.\\nTo put it simply: it works pretty well, but it\\'s not perfect.\\nBefore I get any further, I suppose you should know the basic premise of Tsurezure Children. Each episodes focuses on 4 3-minute clips of different couples and\\ntheir progression in their relationships. There are a TON of couples, and the producers did not spare the love triangles or typical tropes in some characters either.\\nWhat\\'s appreciated for a guy like me is the step away from the typical tropes of tsundere, kuudere, and dandere. The characters feel very human, and while each one can be slapped with any of those three labels (sorry, no yanderes here), they contain enough of a uniqueness to their personality to not make you roll your eyes and feel annoyed. This especially helps the show, as you notice the characters developing based off their chemistry with each other, as well as find out more about each character as their personalities develop. One example is a couple that tries to move to the \"next stage\" in their relationship (physically), but struggle to get the ball moving. As a result, they utilize their longtime friendship beforehand to soften the mood and make the transition easier. These sorts of moments are unquestionably goofy but also comedic and cute. You can see the desire for the characters to grow for one another, and it helps you understand them more.\\nHowever, some couples lack development, especially in terms of the why or how they came to develop feelings for one another. Some of these hurt Tsurezure immensely, as searching for the \"reason\" or the \"how\" simply makes you fail to find one. I\\'m not talking \"they skipped over it because the two are at the \\'let\\'s go out\\' stage,\" I\\'m talking \"one asks why the other likes her and the other guy doesn\\'t give a reason that feels legitimate or real.\" I understand that rom com anime can be otherwise deprived of logic, but these sorts of holes really hurt the chemistry that unfolds onscreen for me.\\nI\\'ll quickly touch on art and sound here. The opening is catchy, and definitely not bad. Same with the ending. The music is generally placed at good timings, and there wasn\\'t a moment where I felt \"Now if only they had some sort of sad song playing here,\" because the song they played fit the mood. Because of the shortness of the actual series, they overlap the ending track and credits with the ending of the episode, and so far they have yet to fail this approach. The producers aren\\'t combining the mellowness of the ending with a comedy bit, so that\\'s a good strategy to fit in their screentime.\\nOverall, I\\'d love to see how these relationships develop by the end before giving my final say. I generally give higher rating, so I\\'d say this might also be an 8 in your books. It\\'s an enjoyable shift away from both the countless harem anime out there and the single couple shoujo style; you have a balance here of multiple couples, and the biggest issue is if you want to see a slow developing romance, or if you just can\\'t keep up with this many couples, and forget who\\'s who.\\nLong story short, if you like to see quick development of characters, some pretty strong interactions and developments, as well as a short and sweet show, this baby\\'s for you. If you\\'re looking for a slow development between one boy and one girl, go find Tsuki Ga Kirei or something.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Hey, an anime short romance that actually does the entire \"misunderstandings schtick\" and NOT get annoying!\\nLA can be really cynical when it comes to romance but LA can open up at times and Tsurezure Children definitely resonated with LA...more on the lines of \"LA wished something would have happened to LA in high school\".\\nTsurezure Children shows vignettes of many different relationships in an unnamed school, from a comedic best friend turned girlfriend and boyfriend, a love at first sight romance, the shy guy and girl coming together and heck even the delinquent tsundere with a quirky teasing smartass.\\nLet\\'s start with Yuki Minagawa voiced by Kana\\nHanazawa who likes to romantically tease Jun Furuya voiced by Kyohei Amasaki in which he has a doting little sister Hotaru Furuya voiced by Haruka Tomatsu who makes some of the best reactions in the anime short. Yuki\\'s teasing is one of the best things about this relationship as she knows ways to get reactions from the Furuya siblings and she is the catalyst to their skits and LA just loves it. LA\\'s most interested relationship would be Masafumi Akagi voiced by Kensho Ono and Ryouko Kaji voiced by Ayane Sakura as their comedic timing and Akagi\\'s teasing are well timed although LA felt he got a bit too far at times. Ayaka Kamine voiced by Yui Ogura and Takeru Gouda voiced by Tomoaki Maeno although their relationship grows in which Ayaka is the one that pushes it while Takeru once to take it slow was kinda ok in LA\\'s opinion and not the most interesting relationship for LA, though Ayaka got better for LA, trying to push their relationship and showing that she\\'s more than a shy girl archetype. Takurou Sugawara voiced by Kaito Ishikawa and Chizuru Takano voiced by Inori Minase has the entire love at first sight romance and like Ayaka and Takeru\\'s relationship was less interesting for LA, heck probably was LA\\'s least interesting relationship the anime looked at but thankfully their relationship got better by the end of it. Kana Ijima voiced by Akari Kito and Chiaki Uchimura voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita are the \"misunderstandings\" relationships and really what works in this entire comedic timing and misunderstandings is that for the MOST part, their misunderstandings comes from outside sources that causes their misunderstandings and seeing BOTH sides of their misunderstandings, thus it both cancels any chance of these characters from being idiots and allows for great comedic timing and by the end of it, LA ROOTED for these two to be together because fate or awkward situations just had to crash their party. FINALLY, the only other relationship LA needs to look at were Takao Yamane voiced by Hiro Shinono and Chiyo Kurihara, the two twice shy characters however LA really didn\\'t like Takao stopping Chiyo\\'s advances and keeps railroading himself and self depreciative nature caused LA to get really annoyed with him.\\nThe animation by Studio Gokumi were for the most part decent though some of the facial animation got derped at times but LA can give the animation some grace as the animation wasn\\'t the most important focus in this anime short. Still Studio Gokumi did what they are known for in making moe character designs and still was consistent at that (aside from the occasional derps).\\nThe voice acting, well there are THREE voice actors LA would praise in this anime short. Ayane Sakura, Haruka Tomatsu and Kana Hanazawa. Ayane Sakura took LA\\'s favourite voice actor for this anime short, if not because of her adorable tsundere (mainly leaning on her dere) vocals, Haruka Tomatsu for doing her crazed doting little sister scthick and made amazing chemistry with Kana Hanazawa all the more better and Kana Hanazawa\\'s teasing vocals were great for her aforementioned great chemistry with Haruka Tomatsu.\\nIf anything Tsurezure Children was LA\\'s most surprising anime short and heck anime for Summer 2017 to the point of LA giving Tsurezure Children the best romance for Summer 2017. If you wanna see a misunderstanding romance that ISN\\'T annoying to various romances with a ton of comedy, leaps and bounds, trials and tribulations to them then Tsurezure Children is a definite watch.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '129fd7c4c5444af97ee2da4f3a2fa790'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Turn A Gundam marks a turning point in the career of Yoshiyuki Tomino.  Caught in a severe depression during and after the production of Victory Gundam he turned out two lackluster projects (Brainpowered and Garzey's Wing).  As he came out of his depression he began developing an idea for a new Gundam series to include all the alternate continuities into one the Correct Century.  He succeeds with Turn A Gundam.\\nBreaking away from his Kill 'Em All melodramas that marked his earlier successes, he came up with a much lighter outlook which has shown in the works  after.  While\\nTurn A follows the usual teenager finding  himself piloting a mecha in a war it manages to present plot devise in an interesting and untried  way successfully.  The Mecha themselves (by futurist Syd Mead who designed Blade Runner and Tron) are so aesthetically different they border on grotesque.  This plays very well in early episodes when the battles take on a very War of the Worlds feel to them.  The characters interacting in a typically rich Tomino script are well rounded,  likable, and surprisingly complex who carry with them stings of an individual plot that the director skillfully weaves into a deep and complex story.  The plot itself is heartwarming, funny, tense and has Machiavellian dealings on both sides of the war.  Action does take a back seat to plot development, but as the series progresses fights become faster, more brutal, and with none of the canned battles that tend to pop up in mecha series recently.  Yoko Kanno delivers again in the soundtrack,  one of my favorites she has done.   Of Particular note is Tsuki no mayu which appears in the first episodes in one of the most memorable scenes in the show.\\nNow if there was a downside I would have to say hardcore action fans would be disappointed in the slower pacing as Tomino slowly develops characters and the political situation.  On the plus side this is one of the few Gundam series you do not need prerequisite knowledge to understand what is going on.   It also has the single best ending I have ever seen in an anime.  Whether you are a mecha fan or not  I would implore you to at least give this underrepresented series a try, you will undoubtedly find something to you own liking.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2b7932e34e2cfff1e4d8841044aef6a1'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'This is not your average Gundam series.\\nIf you\\'re not familiar with Gundam and the UC universe in particular, then this is not a good place to start.\\nIt does have a stand alone story, but it\\'s certainly not intended for people who have little to no prior knowledge about the franchise.\\nThis is a spoiler free review.\\n*Story*\\nThis one takes place thousands of years in the future in which the only space colony left is on the moon and obviously its population has advanced technology (including mechs of course), meanwhile, the people on earth are still living in a 1930s way of life. Everything is fine and dandy,\\nuntil one day the moonrace decide to return to their roots, earth. And of course, a war breaks out.\\nIt is a little different from the usual Gundam since it gives one side of the war a clear advantage due to their technology and knowledge on how to use it, while the other side is rather primitive. They also make it clear how different the two cultures are in many interesting ways and the 1930s clothes and technology really give off a unique vibe to this series, it\\'s something you rarely see in anime in general.\\nIt\\'s also different because the atmosphere is relatively lighthearted, but at the same time it also deals with its themes and issues with a straight face.\\nAnother thing you\\'ll notice about Turn A is that even though it follows the Gundam tradition of a boy eventually finding a Gundam - piloting it - fighting in a war and so on.. It also goes through its traditional route in a noticeably unique way that you\\'d never see elsewhere. Furthermore, it\\'s also famous for containing various easter eggs from previous Gundams that only fans will immediately recognize.\\nI must warn you though, that the first episode is very rushed and poorly presented. I don\\'t know what they were smoking when they made it, but thankfully the next 3 or so episodes slow down and assist in making everything sink in. And much like in most series in the franchise, the pacing in general is kinda slow and it does get faster towards the end. And it\\'s not really slower than usual so you should be used to this by now.\\nThe story is also very rich since it explores this conflict through the various perspectives of each party that\\'s involved, whether it\\'s the citizens, the spies, the soldiers or the leaders of each side. It does this very throughly and it keeps going back and forth from peace or some sense of settlement and then back in to war again so the situation won\\'t remain static. Also things do get wrapped up very nicely and the story is concluded very well. It also focuses a little more on politics than your average Gundam and as a result it doesn\\'t have as much action and the battles aren\\'t on a massive scale with many deaths in each episode either, but it does make sure that most deaths have a certain impact on the story and not just death for the sake of it (I\\'m looking at you, Victory Gundam).\\nOverall the story is both more unique and more complex than usual, but as a result it\\'s also a little more clunky and it felt like it\\'s a bit much for the show to handle from time to time. Heck, at times it\\'s even a bit hard to follow because it keeps jumping around, but I still think it\\'s handled very well for the most part.\\n*Characters*\\nAs much as I love Gundam in general, I can\\'t deny that characters and characterization are among the franchise\\'s biggest weaknesses. Gundam characters normally consist of angsty teens and/or dumb adults who randomly do irrational and unreasonable actions for petty reasons just to take the story in a certain direction. This is a bad thing because it normally makes them feel like slaves to the story without much free will or solid reasoning behind them.\\nFortunately, in this particular installment those types of things seem to be toned down significantly. Some characters are even more complex than usual and their motives and dilemmas are a lot more believable and easier to follow.\\nWhether these motives are related directly to the war, or just normal motives related to their personal lives as a result of the war. This is truly what drives the story forward and not in an overly forced way.\\nMany characters are inserted in to different inconvenient scenarios throughout the series that inevitably change them over the course of it. Their development in general is given a lot of time and focus.\\nEven the main character is not your usual Gundam angsty teenage boy either. He\\'s basically a pacifist, (\"I\\'m on neither side!\") and much like the story, he\\'s also quite unusual. Oh, and I should probably mention that this boy talks, looks and even dresses up like a girl from time to time. So that might turn off some people (and turn on others, lol).\\nI\\'m no fan of these types of characters, but this does make him far more memorable than usual. But besides that, he\\'s also well portrayed and his actions are usually quite believable. The only downside is that he\\'s kind of a Mary Sue and he\\'s mostly the one who\\'s there to change the people who surround him and not the other way around..\\nThe series even tries to avoid having clear villains, but I\\'d be lying if I said it completely succeeds, since they do emerge eventually. And some characters even seem like plot devices who\\'s main purpose is to prolong the conflict between the two sides (quick! throw in some random lunatic before they find an excuse to stop fighting each other!). Though I do like how some characters that seem to be very minor at first, unexpectedly play rather important roles later on.\\nOverall, for a Gundam series, these characters are handled exceptionally well and are also pretty memorable.\\n*Art*\\nThe visuals do have their ups and downs.\\nOn one hand the mecha designs are nothing amazing and the production values in general are a little low for the franchise. The Gundam of this series in particular gives me a craving for Pringles for some reason. With that being said, there are cameos of mechs from other Gundam series, most notably, the Zaku which is present through out most of the series. Now that more than makes up for those weird designs for me.\\nThe animation is overall fairly average, but the battle choreography is noticeably good and well above average, despite having less action in terms of quantity than most Gundams do.. And that\\'s probably the result of it being on a smaller scale.\\nIn terms of character designs, they aren\\'t the most detailed, but are expressive enough and they do have an interesting variety in their features. Each one looks very different from the other and the 1930s clothes add a lot to it as well.\\n*Sound*\\nThe first opening is a pop song (I guess) and it isn\\'t exactly a masterpiece, but you get used to it and at least the lyrics fit perfectly with what the series is about. And pretty much the same can be said for the second opening.\\nThe ending songs aren\\'t bad, but are way too quiet for me to remember and the soundtrack in general doesn\\'t have much variety but it does fit the series\\' tone and it\\'s very noticeable. Especially one track in particular that had a violin in it, or something..\\nI don\\'t speak Japanese, but voice acting is also ok, I guess, but nothing really stands out about it.\\n*Enjoyment/Overall* 8/10\\nI enjoyed it very much of course.\\nIt\\'s an exceptional Gundam series and a great anime on its own as well.\\nThough admittedly, not every Gundam fan would appreciate it because of how different it is.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Story and Characters\\nInitially, Turn A Gundam started as a total departure from the normal Universal Century Gundam formula. Set hundreds of years from the traditional gundam storyline, the earth has just began to recover from the depredations of the gundam wars, and the old earth citizens who escaped from the moon are planning a return to earth.\\nOur protagonist Loran, is one of three \"advance scouts\" sent to earth by the Moon\\'s queen, Dianna, to figure out if the planet is (1) habitable (2) worth returning to. This is his story. On the way he learns about earth, the moonrace decides to return and he inevitably\\nends up piloting a powerful relic from past \"Dark History\", the Turn A Gundam. He also ends up surrounded by powerful, strong women - at least, compared to other gundam series, the women in this series seem REALLY strong, and I don\\'t mean physically. But the best characters by far were Keith and Guin Lineford.\\nI have to admit, the first 22 episodes of Turn A Gundam flew by as the story, characters, lay of the land and politics unfurled. This whole set up was extremely well done and I was intrigued. Around episode 23 to 42, it started getting ... well ... repetitive and boring. Also by then my suspension of disbelief broke. Some of the actions of the third level peon military characters made me incredulous, I guess I can\\'t believe how stupid they were, or how quick they were to change allegiences.\\nHowever, the series redeemed itself. By episode 43, there was a HUGE, major plot twist that made the last 7 episodes or so fantastic. To be honest, if this series was condensed to 26 episodes and the middle one third cut out, it could have been as great as 08th MS team! Again, this is another of those gundam series that had great potential but it wasn\\'t fully utilized.\\nArt/Animation\\nOverall, animation was very dated with a lot of frame reuse, so was ok for its time but compared to current anime it really shows its age. But, I hated the moustache on the Turn A Gundam. It was ugly, seemed kind of pretentious and served no useful weapon or asthetic purpose other than having people be able to call it \"the moustache gundam\". Maybe I\\'m being harsh but when you think of the sunglasses from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan - now, that\\'s how you do a feature correctly! In this respect the Turn A Gundam animators/model designers failed horribly!\\nTo be fair, the Turn X gundam was actually a good looking gundam. All the rest were blocky and not appealing. Well, let\\'s just say if I had the space to collect gundam models, based on this anime, the only one I\\'d buy is Turn X. Whereas I\\'d have purchased nearly every gundam from Gundam Wing, Gundam Seed, you get the picture. Art/Mecha design just wasn\\'t well done.\\nSound\\nAverage sound effects, but the soundtrack was unexpectedly good, no great! Ending and theme songs were where this series really excelled. One of the ED songs \"Moon\\'s Coccoon\" I have heard later used in RahXephon. I researched the OST and was not surprised to find out it is done by Yoko Kanno, a composer I really like. So, sound has a high score!\\nEnjoyment\\nI am in euphoria at having finished one of the last \"old\" gundam series, which makes my goal of completing ALL gundam closer to being fully achieved. Turn A Gundam\\'s premise was intriguing, everything dragged in the middle and it got exciting again at the end. All this with a really good soundtrack and one of the best last 5 min epilogues I\\'ve seen in Gundam.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Ever since I reviewed Gundam Build Fighters series aka the modern era for Gundam I wanted to check out the Gundam franchise again because Gundam Build Fighters series was the series that re intrudes me to the Gundam universe. At the time the only Gundam show that I saw before GBF is Gundam 0079 and a bit of Gundam Wing. Over the course of last year I started to watch the Gundam universe from 00. Wing, Seed, Iron Blood Orphans and so on. Some were great and others range from mediocre to bad. Now out of the all the Gundam shows Turn A Gundam is\\nthe one of the few Gundam shows that doesn't get a lot of hate but has been praised by a lot of anime fans including Gundam enthusiast such as myself.\\nHello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataTrigger and welcome to my review of Turn A Gundam and with that out of the way let's get started.\\nStory.\\nIt is the year correct century 2345 the earth has almost all of its space travel technology after a series of past cataclysms and has since been reduced to the technological logical levels of the World War 1 era. On the other hand the people on the moon also called the Moon race left earth long ago to live in space until they deem the earth suitable to return to. The story of Turn A follows a young member of the moon race named Loran Cehack who was selected along with his friends Fran and Keith to take part on a recon mission to see if the earth is suitable for resettlement. After landing on earth Loran befriends the Heim family as well as being hired for work. 2 years later during the Coming of Age ceremony the moon race deploys mobile suits and tries to earth by force. During the chaos the ceremony statue crumbles and reveals a While Doll aka an ancient mobile suit. Loran uses the mobile suit to fight back and the two sides call for a ceasefire. Soon the earth forces discover more mobile suits from the past who is known as the Dark History and uses them to fight back against the moon race while the Moon Race just simply just want to return to earth as they original home. Now Loran must find a way to maintain peace and prevent both sides from starting an all out war with each other.\\nTurn A Gundam marks the return of director Yoshiyuki Tomino, after recovering from depression from Victory Gundam. However Tomino had a amputation. The amputation is to end the Gundam franchise.\\nAlso Tomino decided to combine every single Gundam universe together. From Universal Century to After War.\\nLike most Gundam shows Turn A is set in futuristic calendar but the setting itself looks like it takes place in the early 20th century. This will play a huge role in the story as its connection with the Turn A.\\nThe tone in Turn A Gundam is mostly balanced unlike Tomino's others such as the brutal Victory Gundam or the Goofy ZZ Gundam.\\nThe pacing of Turn A may be slow but unlike Gundam Wing where it doesn't do anything in the terms of worldbuilding or character development. Turn A actually uses the slow pacing for great character building, worldbuilding and themes exploration.\\nSpeaking of World building the worldbuilding in Turn A is beautifully as its shows the life of the moon and earth races and very little things such as the perofomise of the coming of age ceremony and the amount of detail to such set events is honestly refreshing\\nI personally didn't mind the pacing at all.\\nOne more thing you should know is Turn A Gundam is not your average Gundam show. You will need some knowledge about the Gundam before diving in to this series due the show referencing stuff from past Gundam shows as well as Dark History bits of the show.\\nI can’t talk about anymore about the story of Turn A due to spoilers for both this show as well as the other Gundam shows but what it is Turn A Gundam story is great and very refreshing when compare to other Gundam shows.\\n9/10\\nCharacters.\\nThe characters in Turn A are a massive step up from the bland and unlikable cast that is from Gundam Wing and they are actually interesting and very likeable to watch from start to finish.\\nLoran Chack is honestly a great protagonist for Gundam.\\nHe is smart, mature and very likeable. He's also a pacifist unlike Quatre Raberba Winner (Gundam Wing) and Kira Yamato (Gundam Seed) who are hypocritical and pretentious idiots who fail at being a pacifist. Loran actually threatens his foes first and if they didn't comply then he will take action. Loran is honestly the best Pascfist character in all of Gundam and hes a perfect example how to do a pacifist pilot the correct way.\\nSochie may be a bit annoying but unlike the girls in Gundam Seed you can actually sympathise with her. Sochie life was turned upside down by the moon race and now she is trying to make a best of it. I personally kinda like Sochie as a character.\\nKihei Heim and especially Queen Dianna are two of the best female characters in Gundam. They are both well developed they are both interesting to watch from start to finish. I really the way they get to see the war from a different point of view and the way they deal with their situation is whets makes these two very interesting and likeable.\\nIn the wave of terrible female characters in Gundam especially the ones in the cosmic era timeline both characters stand out in their own right as characters.\\nThe rest of the characters are just plan fantastic as they are very likeable, memorable and have a purpose in the story and event of Turn A Gundam\\nOverall the characters in Turn A are amazing.\\n9/10\\nVisuals.\\nThe visuals of Turn A Gundam is great and refreshing.\\nThe animation is smooth, constant and thankfully there is no stock footage used whatsoever.\\nWhile the show may not be as well detailed as Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star and Escaflowne I still think Turn A looks impressive. Compare that to Gundam Wing where the show had inconstant visuals, choppy animation and heavily abused stock footage.\\nAlso the overkill formula from Wing has completely is non-existent making the battles in Turn A feel a lot more balanced in a narrative.\\nI personally really like the character designs as they are very unique and original. It will take some time to get used with the character designs but once you get used it you will have a great time watching Turn A.\\nLastly the mecha designs in Turn A very unique, well drawn, very original and they fit with the setting and atmosphere of Turn A perfectly. My favourite mecha designs are the Turn A and the Turn X. They are so original very well design and fit well with the setting of Turn A Gundam perfectly.\\nOverall the visuals of Turn A are great.\\n8/10\\nSound.\\nThe soundtrack of Turn A is nothing but amazing. At this time of the review Turn A Gundam soundtrack is easily my favourite soundtrack in all of Gundam dethroning the Gundam Build Fighters soundtrack and I consider that soundtrack to be amazing. The soundtrack of Turn A was done by Yoko Kanno who also done the soundtracks of Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain, Ghost in the shell stand alone complex and Escaflowne.\\nBoth openings are great put I personally prefer Century Colour over Turn A Gundam because the prefer the beat and the tone of it.\\nThe ending theme is good but not very memorable in opinion\\nSadly Turn A Gundam doesn't have a dub but the Japanese voice acting is top notch.\\nOverall the soundtrack in Turn A is great as well as the voice acting and the openings were great.\\n9/10\\nFinal Thoughts.\\nTurn A Gundam is easily the most underrated show from the Gundam franchise.\\nLucky Rightstuff in America has officially released the series on DVD and Blu Ray.\\nThe UK version will be release soon but it will be a Blu Ray format only. For people who don't have a Blu ray player you can always import the DVD versions of Turn A from websites such as Okatu.co.uk or United Publications and they are cheap to buy now.\\nTurn A Gundam is a great show that everyone should check.\\nIt has a great story, fantastic world-building, amazing and well rounded characters, impressible visuals, along with original mecha designs and a beautiful soundtrack.\\nThe only minor complaints that I have with Turn A Gundam is the pacing. I personally liked the pacing in Turn A but it may bother some people.\\nTurn A Gundam is easily one of the best Gundam I have ever seen from the franchise\\nI give Turn A Gundam a 9/10.\\nAnyway this was KurataTrigger I will see you guys next time.\\nStay tune for my next Gundam review where I will be reviewing Gundam Seed Season 1\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'cedb4a51d4dcfc0c19a4f76c952852ab'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I had a few recommendations for this series, telling me this was a great Gundam Series.  Unfortunately I can't agree.\\nThe series takes place a few thousand years after previous Gundam Series.  After a great war many humans fled to the moon, the remaining humans on earth slowly struggled to survive.  Eventually the earth civilization resembles the early to mid 1900s.  Then the Moonrace comes back to the earth claiming a right to live on the planet.  War then erupts between the moonrace and earth.\\nThe overall story was the best part of the series.  I liked the new plot to\\nthe Gundam Series, though it did resemble the better series Gundam X.  The biggest problem I had with the story was the Kihel Heim/Dianna Soreil story.  It wasn't done well and very hard to keep track of.\\nThe characters were the worst part of the series.  Vertically all the characters from Loran Cehack, Guin Sard Lineford, Miashei Kune, Sochie Heim and the rest weren't intresting.  I didn't really care about any of them or what happened to them.\\nThe animation/Music was also pretty good.  The animation was pretty good, but could have been better, this isn't that old of a series.  I really enjoyed the muisc it added to the series.\\nOverall it's just another average Gundam series, and not on the level of the original Gundam, Gundam X or 08TH MS TEAM.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'eaef58f1b68cd99adef2c145a1cbb115'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The mid to late nineties was a dark time for the Gundam franchise. After several flops for once famed director, Yoshiyuki Tomino, he seemed to be on his way out from the anime community. His interesting blend of politics, misanthropy, and cynicism was finally losing its novelty. After the poorly received Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Tomino entered a several year hiatus.  The hiatus seemed to have no end in sight until he came back in 1999 with Turn A Gundam, arguably the strongest written anime Tomino has ever produced.\\nTurn A Gundam is a rejection of Tomino’s prior Gundam entries in many ways. While\\nit retains the anti-war message, it replaces his message of cynicism with a newfound hope in humanity’s future. It seems in his hiatus from the anime world, he was able to channel his feelings into a much more focused vision. Using all the experience from his prior endeavors as both an author and director, Turn A Gundam is the answer to both the Gundam universe and Tomino’s own personal strife. Where Zeta was cruel and bleak, Turn A is optimistic and expresses a hope in people that Tomino never had before.\\nTurn A Gundam follows Loran Cehack, a young man from the Moon who was sent to Earth to see if it is ready to be colonized. He spends some time with an Earth family after he was found near dead. Loran soon learns to love the Heim family and become enamored with the Earth and its culture. He tells the officials back on the moon that the Earth is ready for settlement, little did he know that this would spark a conflict that threatens the existence of the entire human race.  This initial premise is vastly different from previous Gundam entries which focused on the conflict between Earth and space. Here the conflict focuses on colonizers and the colonized which is untouched territory in anime.\\nTurn A Gundam tackles the subject of colonization with a finesse that most other anime would not be able to pull off. It is divided into several smaller story arcs with the larger narrative of the Moonrace’s colonization of the Earth tying all these arcs together. Loran tries to balance his new love for the people of the Earth with his loyalty to the Moonrace, his birthrace. He encounters the people of Earth, the rural folk separated from society trying to make a living off farming and how colonization has impacted their livelihood. We see the small store owner who has to sacrifice his own business to placate the hostile invaders.  We see the strife and pain of farming folk who lived lives untouched by war or technology. There is an intimacy in every encounter, a personal touch that other Gundam entries lack due to their epic scale of the narrative.\\nLike all prior Gundam entries, there is never a simple black and white dichotomy. There are those who are part of the Moonrace who also desire peace, who do not wish to see bloodshed on either side. It is this commonality that both sides share allow for moments of diplomacy. Gundam has always been highly political and Turn A Gundam is no different. There are a lot of conversations between the leaders of Earth and The Moon that are easily the highlight of the series. Gundam has always, for me, been the best political anime I have seen. It does not preach political philosophy to you; rather it presents a circumstance for its characters that can only be solved through conversation. The dialogue, which is sometimes stilted in its delivery, never ceases to be informative or well written throughout.\\nThe art of Turn A Gundam reminds me of the American Gothic painting by Grant Wood. The color palate is full of light yellows, whites and beiges. It creates this classic Americana feeling and captures the spirit of a mid-1800s America. The art is easily one of the many highlights of the anime. The soundtrack, done by Yoko Kanno, captures both the delicate moments and the darker, tenser ones. Tracks such as Theory of the World’s Edge blends both an industrial beat with bagpipes highlighting the contrast of cultures in the form of sound. It comes together toward the end into a harmonious, luminous track that is more than music, it is an experience.  There is also the track, The First Advent – God’s Scorn, which has an orchestral feeling with operatic vocals giving the track a dark, foreboding, tone. Turn A Gundam’s soundtrack ranks among Kanno’s best.\\nTurn A’s cast is varied in terms of character and their symbolic purpose. The protagonist, Loran Cehack, is simple to understand in terms of personality. He is a pacifist, against violence and believes that both Earthlings and the Moonrace can live in harmony. Not only does he believe that, he represents that. Loran is the bridge between the two worlds and can navigate through them, highlighting the humanity that both sides share yet ignore due animosity and ignorance.  This animosity and ignorance is what caused the conflict between Newtypes and Oldtypes in prior Gundam anime. Tomino posed a question to his viewers, ‘Can people get along although they are drastically different.’ Loran is the answer to that question, a resounding yes. He may not be as complex as Kamille or Amuro but he serves a higher symbolic purpose than those characters. Not to say they are bad characters, in terms of personality and character traits I highly prefer Kamille and Amuro to Loran. But Turn A Gundam is a show where ideals supersede reality.\\nDianna Soriel, the Queen of the Moonrace and her Earth counterpart, Kihel Heim, are probably the best written characters in Turn A. They switch roles early on in the story, since they are almost identical, and serve as both a way to explore their respective worlds without intrusive exposition and their respective characters. Dianna takes Kihel’s place on Earth while Kihel becomes Queen of the Moonrace.  Dianna learns about humanity, interacting with the people of Earth who have had their lives ruined by colonization which Kihel learns the responsibility of a leader. These are the strongest characters in the show, not because they emulate a man’s behavior. They exude a beauty and strength associated with the female gender, the strength of compassion and conviction. The best moment in the show is a speech given by Kihel/Dianna to both the people of Earth and the Moonrace. A plea for peace so moving it nearly brought tears to my eyes.   The strength of female characters, especially in the West, is associated with them being as close to a man in behavior and ability as possible, rejecting femininity. Tomino has often been accused of sexism, however, he has written arguably one of the best female characters I have seen in both anime and western fiction that maintains a feminine beauty. Kate Chopin BTFO.\\nQueen Dianna’s most trusted guard, Harry Ord, is a char clone on par with the Red Comet himself. He takes Char’s best attributes, wit and ambition and rejects the other flaws, arrogance and sociopathy.  The flaws are what makes Char a great character but it is loyalty that makes Harry a great one as well. He could be viewed as the answer to Char as character. What Char should have been if he was not hampered by his own flaws, he would be close to what Harry is. The dialogue that is going on between these two characters also serves to tie in the many universes of Gundam.\\nTurn A Gundam is the answer to the Gundam Franchise, Tomino’s final call for peace. It would have been a magnificent swan song for him, ending on one of the most beautiful pieces of fiction I have seen in some time. Although there were moments that dragged, specifically the beginning, the middle and end more than make up for whatever slumps there were. Turn A Gundam is the ethos of every Gundam series converging into a single point and forming a singular identity, no longer fragmented by doubt or cynicism.  I will undoubtedly be screaming “UNIVERSE” from now on.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '846dcdb238417102b233d42883ebdfaa'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '[2nd Edit] Turn A Gundam is probably the Gundam series with most diverging opinions out there. I watched every Gundam released and, unfortunately, Turn A didn`t click for me. Overall is the most confusing Gundam out there, with the less interesting plot (although extremely original), the most confusing background scenario, and with the least interesting characters. More bellow.\\nStory: If you are familiar with the UC, you will see a lot of references here. I strongly advise you to not see Turn A if you are not familiar with the UC. The story is already too much of a mess even if you know it. Here\\nis the thing: the story to Turn A is extremely original, and everything you will see in Turn A is completely different from the other Gundam out there. So, why did I considered bad? Well, let me explain: poor execution. Turn A Gundam clearly wants for its plot to be slow-building, which is good. The script is clear: we want to introduce this world, its characters, and we want to show our original story, which is what we want. However, for me, this was poorly executed. First, it is to damn boring. Even after trying to rewatch this series (3 times, people, 3 times!) I still fall asleep multiple times. For a die-hard Gundam fan like me, that\\'s a bad sign because I saw every other Gundam created. Nothing happens until episode 20 or something. The plot is a complete mess, you don`t get what is happening until much later, in a bad way. I  love slow-building stories but Turn A does not create an interesting or mysterious environment that you want to know more. Everything is so mundane, people are absurdly boring, and the society depicted is so lame that time might as well be standing still in that world. You spend way too much time seeing uninteresting dialogs that are completely useless to the plot or anything else, seeing events that have no purpose, and following main characters that you feel no connection what so ever. I felt like watching a theater play from 1500 trying to appeal to the royals.\\nNow, let me explain the second worse thing: the world. Turn A attempts to be a mixed bag of technology and civilization. Society is like late XIX century America, the technology is a mix between that time, World War I, and sci-fi. Sounds good? Well, it isn`t. The fights are absolutely lame, far from any Gundam out there. They are neither military-accurate nor exciting. They are also confusing, people fight in old airplanes, use carabines, then, out of nowhere, they use an old anti-air cannon and you see a mecha! Characters talk about mobile-suits, while in a zeppelin. This might sound cool and all, but it is not. It creates a confusing scenario that you don`t understand how all those elements are mixed in harmony with the world they try to present you. Finally, this show was made to appeal to Americans, because everything is based on an old American story: the clothes, technology, houses, society. It is everything Gundam tried to stay away: being concentrated in one single society. Gundam was aways about a reformed world, where countries united in different ways. Not here, here you will follow the most American Gundam ever made. If you are American you might love it. But for me, it is everything Gundam tried to stay away.\\nArt & Sound: The animation is marvelous, and the art direction is amazing. However, the soundtrack sucks. Not appealing in any way.\\nCharacter: No character appeals to you, and that left me stunned because no other Gundam lacks a character that appeals to you. One thing that SHOULD happen in any movie, series, book, comic, game or anime is that at least one character should be appealing, you must like someone. Or at least hate some character enough to see what is going to happen. None of those options apply in Turn A. Everyone is boring. They have no depth. They don`t talk about interesting subjects. I never felt so uninspired like I felt in Turn A. Every Gundam has some interesting characters, even amidst annoying ones. This one has nothing. I have no words to describe the absolute boredom that it is to see an anime with the most uninteresting characters in the franchise. Even the protagonist is a complete bore. I prefer Shinn Asuka (the most annoying character in the franchise) than him. And Shinn is a bad character from every angle. At least with Shinn, I could feel something. All characters appear to live in stasis, they have no interesting personalities you want to explore. This is one of the reasons I always fell asleep trying to rewatch this show.\\nMechas: The Gundam in this series is, by far, the ugliest main Gundam ever made. They call him \"mustache\" sometimes, so... The rest of the Mechas (with the exception of the classic ones) are also terrible. I don`t know what happened in Turn A because Bandai is always checking Gundam shows to profit from gunplas. And this is the first time I saw a Gundam where I don`t want any gunpla from the show. Many Gundam shows appeal to different audiences because they mix story and mecha action. For example, Gundam 00 is packed with action, and some people love it just for that. In Turn A you will have neither action, nor interesting mechas to see.\\nOverall, some people love Turn A for its originality. I wanted to feel the same, but even after watching the show three times, I just can`t describe the boredom, lack of uninteresting characters, lame mechas, boring fights and everything else that was Turn A - and since Turn A is a standalone Gundam series, I advise you to stay away from this show and use your time for a better Gundam. Want a slow-building story, with amazing characters, exciting fights, and deep political backgrounds?

       "  <Document: {'content': '*SPOILERS FOR TURN A GUNDAM. YOKO KANNO DID THE MUSIC. THIS REVIEW WILL ALSO BE REALLY LONG, BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME*\\nSo, you\\'ve just finished making Cowboy Bebop! The century is turning as we speak! A famous writer presents an idea for a new Gundam show! As you know, some of the last few Gundam works haven\\'t been so successful. Plus, your budget won\\'t be as high this time around given Bebop. Do you take the risk and hope it becomes as successful as Gundam Wing? Do you let it die like some of Yoshiyuki Tomino\\'s other works? Do you think you can pull it\\noff and not let it end up cancelled like with Gundam X? Well, you ARE Studio Sunrise, so you at least try. The result was Turn A Gundam that spanned between mid-1999 to mid-2000. So, does Turn A Gundam make a good Gundam show for the turn of the century? Well, let\\'s find out, shall we?\\nSTORY: 8/10\\nIt is over 2000 years into the Universal Century, and nothing has happened in a long time, except for something called DARK HISTORY. A time long forgotten by most, and for good reason, but we\\'ll get to that. Three \"Moonrace\" people are sent to Earth to see if it is livable and colonizable. One of them is Loran Cehack; eventual pilot of a dug up mobile suit later revealed as Turn A Gundam. The others are: Fran, the journalist, and Keith, the bread maker/bread seller. After they land, Loran almost drowns, only to be saved by Kiel Heim, and as such, become a servant to the Heim family. After some slow paced first few episodes establishing relations and how the \"Moonrace\" is now attempting to forcefully colonize Earth, Queen Diana shows up to attempt negotiations, and if you know war, you know that negotiations rarely work. Eventually, it snowballs into misadventures, unauthorized fights, many new faces squaring off and eventually joining Loran, and then, SPACE! The first 36 episodes take place on Earth, while the last 14 switch between taking place on Earth, in space, and on the moon, depending on the current situation. Allegiances switch with decent explainations to excuse how easily they switch at times, and things get a bit complicated towards the end.\\nWhile this is considered to be viewable as a stand alone Gundam show, this is NOT for newcomers. First off, the pacing is a lot slower than most Gundam shows. In fact, the first few episodes are a bit on the boring side, and if you wanted to start with a Gundam show for fights and picked this one, you may end up dropping this one early on before it picks up steam. Secondly, this is much more lighthearted and pleasant than say, the melodramatic SEED or the action heavy and bleak 00 series. This one rarely gets bleak, and focuses a lot on civilization, more so than most. Sure, there is still war, but it isn\\'t as constant as other mech shows like 00 or even Code Geass. Thirdly, a lot of the lingo in this show is only understandable to those who have seen Gundam shows, and it\\'s easier to understand if you start at the Universal Century, than if you start with other Gundam shows like say SEED and 00, like I did. Many of you who start with this, or even watch this after seeing things they aren\\'t UC, will have a hard time picking up on what a \"Machine Doll\" is.\\nThis DARK HISTORY gets alluded to often, but we only know the truth when they literally reveal it to the world around episode 43. It turns out, before Turn A was worshipped as this \"Whitedoll\" God, t damaged a lot of the world, covering it in dust. It also had a counterpart called Turn X who was also buried and part of DARK HISTORY.\\nThe premise and excecution of the slower paced plot work well, and had some neat twists as it world-builds and interweaves around a large cast of mostly endearing characters. However, there are a few issues preventing this from being truly great. Towards the later episodes, some characters just get left behind, only to appear as if they were doing something we were supposed to know about. The final villain, Gingham, is introduced in episode 37, with no build up or anything. For him to be introduced so late, he should\\'ve at least had build up to excuse that. Some characters are a bit thick headed for their own good and make things unccessesarily complicated, almost to SEED or 00 Second Season levels. Also, there\\'s this really annoying filler around episode 32. At least the ending was pretty good, even if Loran kissing Sochie isn\\'t something I agree with. Luckily, he ends up living with Queen Diana.\\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\nThe cast overall is pretty likable. With few exceptions, I liked most of the characters, and even a lot of ones I didn\\'t like I at least tolerated, with three exceptions (two of them mere meant to be unlikable), but I\\'ll get to them in a bit. Let\\'s start with Loran. He likes peace, Earth, and Queen Diana, and will do anything to protect all 3. He likes resorting to words, but knows that when that fails, he must be violent, albeit he\\'d rather not kill anyone if possible. Such traits are found with many, such as Kira Yamato from SEED, but this time, it\\'s actually done right! For one, he isn\\'t whiny like other Gundam protagonists, nor is he bland, like other Gundam protagonists. He is naïve at age 17, but knows what must be done with his Gundam, even if he resorts to peaceful options first. Next, we have Queen Diana, or as the Moonrace call her, DIANA-SAMA!! She is lovely. While a princess wanting peace isn\\'t that original, likely even at the time, she is a very likable person, worshipped by the commoners of the Moonrace. She and an Earth lookalike named Kiel also switch places from time to time, with no one noticing. For one, I really like these kinds of plot lines. It adds more complexity and excitement to these kinds of shows. She also gets fleshed out over the course of the middle of the first half in particular, and is actually a very sad person from hundreds of years ago. Plus, her acting skills are amazing and are likely real, as seen when she cries over Kiel\\'s fathers grave while taking the role of Kiel. Unfortunately, she isn\\'t much of a powerful ruler, as her power hungry subordinates in fact have a majority of the power.\\nDiana\\'s ultimate subordinate, Harry Ord is a cool guy who you just can\\'t hate, even with his horrible fashion sense when it comes to formal events. He is responsible, cool, sneaky, and badass. He\\'s probably my favorite character here, and considering the other two I mentioned so far, that sais something. He also ends up in love with Kiel Heim. She often switches place with Diana, but unlike Diana, we don\\'t really get to flesh Kiel out that much. Ultimately, her words are far more scathing when the situation calls for it, especially towards the final few episodes. However, aside from falling in love with Harry, not much is fleshed out about her. Now, for the ones I hate. To put it bluntly, Sochie Heim is a racist, obnoxious, arrogant, rude, idiot, and I hate her. She is quite possibly the worst girl I have seen in a Gundam show, and considering Flay from SEED, that says quite a lot! It got to a point where Loran had to literally slap some sense into her! I did enjoy that however, as well as when she bumps her head into Turn A Gundam in episode 40.\\nFor the sake of time, I\\'ll only go in depth in one more character: Gingham. He is an ok villain. He is thirsty for battle, and believes that it is an art that the Moonrace have unfortunately forgotten about. He pilots the Turn X and as such, is very fascinated about the Turn A. He goes very far to start a fight, as long as it doesn\\'t involve acting up during moments of diplomacy. Like I said, this does leave out many characters for the sake of time, like Corrin\\'s obsession with his hatred of Gundams, and other diverse characters with their own agendas and journeys, like Lilly, Grey, and many, many others. A lot of them do get interweaved into the plot rather well, and a lot of them are antagonists at one point or another given their agendas. However, like I said in the STORY section, some characters do get left out a bit too long. I didn\\'t even cover those two enemy assholes I hate that work for Gingham, like Merrybell, another major contender for worst Gundam Girl.\\nART: 6/10\\nComing right after Cowboy Bebop, this really sign have the best of excuses for not looking so good. However, given how long the show is, and how it came after Bebop, it DOES have some excuses. The art is very dated by today\\'s standards, and even by the standards of the time. The animation gets very poor at times as well. Odd visual tricks are used that don\\'t work very well. Oddly enough, some scenes and even whole episodes look very well, as if a lot more detail was placed into them, like episode 22, or that scene in episode 40 where the \"river people\" or Loran\\'s hometown are introduced. The openings, especially OP 2, also have better visuals than a large chunk of the show. The same applies to ED 2 which looks actually kinda wired and abstract, but makes sense in the context of the last 9 episodes. It kinda sucks that it can\\'t look as good as those scenes all the time. However, the battles are mostly well done, aside from the times where they show the pilot via a visual box. The fights are entertaining for most part, especially during the last few fights, like whenever Turn X and Turn A square off. I did like how they handled the Nuclear Missle explosions.\\nSOUND: 8/10*\\n*NO DUB EXISTS, AND CONSIDERING HOW OLD THIS SERIES IS, A DUB WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAPPEN*\\nThis soundtrack was done by Yoko Kanno. It isn\\'t AS good as say, Cowboy Bebop, or even Macross Fronter, but it is a pretty good OST. I like the guitar but that plays during many episodes of the first half, as well as \"Moon\" a track that plays during the first episode, the final episode, and only a few other times; which oddly enough, sound different then any other Yoko Kanno song I\\'ve heard. Many tracks don\\'t stand out that much, but are still likable tracks nonetheless. OP 1, Turn A Turn, is a very unique OP. It isn\\'t as energetic as most OPs are nowadays, or even some Gundam OPs, but is really fits with Turn A Gundam. It is still a very catchy theme. Unfortunately, after episode 38, it gets replaced with OP 2, Century Color, an OP that doesn\\'t fit with Turn A, doesn\\'t fit with Gundam as a whole, and isn\\'t even very good. ED 1, Aura, is also a plea to theme, as well as calming and slow. I rather enjoyed it. ED 2 is very similar to \"Moon\", but is sung by someone else. It is also a very good song. Oddly enough, episode 50 as a third ED that also has ED 2\\'s visuals, and as expected, isn\\'t as good as the other EDs. Like I said, this is still a good OST, even if it isn\\'t as legendary as Bebop\\'s.\\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\nLike I said, the beginning is a bit boring, but it picks up after episode 5, and gets rather entertaining at points. I like when it focuses in misadventures that don\\'t directly correlate to war. Episode 21 is a bleaker spin on this, but is probably the most pleasant episode of them all, except episode 9, which shows how well Diana fits as Kiel. It does lose a bit of fun around episodes 24-34, especially those damn fillers in episodes 32 and 33, but it picks up a bit afterwards. The final 9 episodes make a nice climax with some neat twists and the reveal of DARK HISTORY. Plus, the finale was pretty good. Just a shame it has those few dark spots like the filler, and some of the Moonrace that antagonize our heroes during the mid-way point.\\nOVERALL: 8/10    RAW SCORE: 8.11/10\\nThis is probably my favorite Gundam series so far. It isn\\'t perfect, or even truly impressive, but is is a mostly pleasant and entertaining series, even if you will need to get familiar with some Gundam shows before jumping into this one. It has its flaws in places, which I already covered, but it is still a likable show that deserves some more attention, especially the attention of those familiar with the Universal Century timeline. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '23e7936b3858a761bf974216907201f6'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'One thing that has kept the Gundam metaseries relevant over the decades is the fact that it can completely change the setting, style, and characters from series to series yet still feel like a Gundam show as long as it retains some key elements. The great flexibility of Gundam is shown yet again with Turn A Gundam, a series that is not without weaknesses but still successfully tries to separate itself from the Gundam pack.\\nWhen I first started watching the show, I immediately connected with most of the extremely likable and interesting characters. Sometimes, it takes a while for characters in a Gundam show to\\ngrow on you, but it\\'s very apparent from the first few episodes of Turn A that many of the characters feel real. Loran himself is probably the first Gundam pilot without some severe mental disorder. He\\'s not as anti-social as Amuro or as hot-headed as Kamille and Domon. He\\'s not a panic-stricken youth like Uso or a soldier who has thrown away his emotions like Heero. He\\'s just a guy with a (not overbearing) sense of justice trying to find his place in the world. Who cross-dresses when necessary.\\nThe other good guy characters pleasantly surprised me even more than Loran. Dianna I thought would be another impractical idealist who represents some kind of purity, but she takes a lot of risks and action after realizing her flaws. She can be giving an eloquent speech one minute and in disguise, wielding a rifle the next minute. Sochie is another protagonist I found intriguing, as she goes through a ton of personal growth as the series goes on. Even minor characters, like Corin Nander, had the potential to steal the show every time he was on screen.\\nThe weakness of the series started to become apparent to me when after this great cast of characters was laid out, very little happened. The conflict of the main story revolves around the people of the moon trying to migrate back to Earth, and the Earth trying to stop the perceived invasion. However, the conflict is really a result of racial tensions and differing view-points of what is right. The higher-ups on both sides of the conflict seem to want peace, which makes the whole conflict rather weak.\\nFor the first 40 out of 50 episodes really, mobile suit battles are small scale and often the result of disgruntled soldiers defying their commanders. It\\'s not until Gym Gingham appears very late in the series that we even get a true antagonist. The overall weakness of the \"bad guys\" in Turn A is apparent when looking at MAL\\'s character page, where nobody has even bothered to yet list any of the show\\'s troublemakers outside of Gingham (I may fix this).\\nThe general setting and aesthetic of Turn A is wonderful. The technology and fashion of the Earth at the beginning of the show represents the 1920s or 1930s. It makes everyone look very fashionable as they fly around in their suits. The hair of Dianna and Kihel is probably the most well-animated hair outside of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. The music in Turn A varies in quality but is overall good. The first OP is very good, the second OP is very bad. The first ED is okay but somewhat forgettable. The second ED is one of the best EDs I\\'ve ever heard.\\nIt\\'s apparent that Tomino was going for something radically different from his usual depressing war epics. He purposely wanted to move away from epic battles and \"Kill Em All\" with an extremely colorful show that is 100% character-driven. In some ways, this was a success and made this particular series memorable among the crowded Gundam universe. In other ways, the action and deviousness was probably minimized too much. The plot moves very slowly at times, with very few plot turns before the run up to the finale. I can handle a lack of action as long as you put something else compelling in its place, which Turn A didn\\'t do well at times.\\nBecause of the lack of action, this Gundam series has the potential to be very polarizing among people who watch this show with certain expectations for how mecha needs to be. Even after keeping an open mind, I still have my issues with the pacing and the weakness of the overall conflict. However, the strength of the characters make it a show I don\\'t regret having seen.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '1c7417da3bbb84603c3dd9e85c217a90'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'The Mobile Suit Gundam series has existed since 1979, so 36 years old as of the end of 2015 later this year, and in that large span of time, Sunrise and Bandai have put out a vast array of Gundam anime. And for the 20th Anniversary of Gundam in 1999 they released the first Yoshiyuki Tomino(Creator of Gundam) series since Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Turn A Gundam. And even when placed against the myriad of Gundam series, and even the black sheep Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Turn A Gundam is a bit of an oddball.\\nIt is a well known fact that Gundam often portrays large\\nscale wars with high death tolls of both soldiers and civilians and the emotional, the psychological effect that it has on the main cast of characters. But Turn A Gundam has neither a large death toll nor any kind of psychological effect. Very few characters actually died in this series compared to any other and their deaths had very little impact on the main cast. In fact, compared to Gundams normal dark atmosphere, Turn A is actually very lighthearted, very free spirited. And this is quite the departure from just about any Gundam series in existence save Gundam Build Fighter/Build Fighters Try and Gunpla Builders Beginning G. As a fan who really likes the dark atmosphere, this was kind of a letdown.\\nThe characters themselves though weren\\'t bad by any stretch of the imagination. The Moonrace protagonist Loran Cehack wants nothing more than for his fellow Moonrace to come and live on Earth. And this creates conflict with some kind characters who hold racial prejudice against the Moonrace who violently emigrated to Earth. And this puts him in an interesting position because the story constantly wants him to choose between the Terrans or the Moonrace and despite fighting for the Terrans, he still manages to walk a very grey line. His two main companions, Kihel and Sochie Heim also play an important role. Kihel looks identical to the Moonrace Queen Dianna Soriel which proves to be a crucial plot point as the story progresses and Sochie reflects the maturation of the cast. She goes from being the spoiled daughter of a mine who is racist against the Moonrace for killing her father, to being a mature woman who becomes the head of the Heim household despite being the younger sibling. The Royal Guard Captain, Harry Ord, is probably one of the most interesting Gundam characters I\\'ve ever seen. His unquestionable loyalty and devotion to Queen Dianna shows itself multiple times over the course of the series. The rest of his personality is unlike any other character. He wears the strangest clothing and constantly tugs on his sleeve because he thinks it \"makes him look dandy.\" Harry is definitely a unique character.\\nThe theme of the show was kind of hard to nail down for the majority of its 50 episode run. At first I assumed it was all about racism or coexistance, but that wasn\\'t it at all. It\\'s only in the stretch of the last 10 episodes of the show that the true theme comes out: Human Nature. Despite the Terrans and Moonrace having developed separately over the course of 2,000 to 3,000 years, they are both still Human at the core, and it is often said that fighting is in Human nature. Neither race displayed this nature for those thousand or so years that they had no contact, and when the Moonrace finally began to return to the Earth, it awakened Humanity\\'s desire to wage war, and in turn awakened it within the Moonrace. And that is the theme of the show. It wasn\\'t trying to hide it from you so it really isn\\'t a spoiler. It\\'s just that it isn\\'t as readily apparent as it would be in most other series. That confusion took some of the enjoyment out of it for me because I like to see how they tackle the theme over the course of the series.\\nI have to give praise to both the art and the sound though. The art was really good for a 1999 series. Very detailed, very fluid, and very vibrant. They shunned the use of newly emergent computer tricks and it was all hand drawn. So props where props are due. As for the sound, the soundtrack was composed by Yoko Kanno, which is an immediate win in my book. I\\'ve had \"Moon\" and \"The Third Advent\" on repeat for days now. The sound effects are entirely new as far as I can tell, especially having watched a vast majority of the available Gundam series. Most series reuse sound effects to avoid having to create new ones, and so it gets repetitive after a while of hearing those sounds since the beginning of time. Turn A was refreshing in that respect.\\nAnd so looking back at Turn A Gundam, it is by no means my favorites as it didn\\'t quite live up to what I expect a Gundam show to be. Many of my friends had hyped it up as being the pinnacle of Gundam stories, and they would know since they grew up with the first Gundam and so on, but to me it just didn\\'t feel like Gundam. I had Mobile Suits and Gundams, it had a very Gundam theme to it, but at the end of the day it just didn\\'t feel like the Gundam that I fell in love with. And so it\\'s somewhat of a love/hate relationship because I liked the story, the character, the music, the art, and I did enjoy it, but at the same time it just didn\\'t scratch that itch. And I noticed quite a few similarities with the currently airing Gundam: Reconquest in Gravity(Yes, that is the actual English translation of the name.). Both were conceived and written by Yoshiyuki Tomino and both are more lighthearted than their predecessors. Though this is to be expected since Turn A\\'s Correct Century timeline is the destiny of all Gundam timelines, whether the show was made before or after Turn A aired. Correct Century is, officially, an actual continuation of the original Universal Century timeline from the original Gundam series, and therefore it is also a direct continuation of Reconquest\\'s Reguild Century which comes directly after the Universal Century. This is made even more apparent because the country or continent of Ameria exists in both Reconquest and Turn A.\\nI digress, Turn A Gundam seems like more of an acquired taste even for Gundam fans. Fans who have been around since the beginning will be able to pick Turn A up in a heartbeat because it\\'s a Tomino series, but people who grew up on the alternate universe series like Wing, X, G, SEED, or 00 will more than likely find it hard which is to be expected. In fact, the same is happening with Reconquest at the moment. So really, I say give the show a try, but not even I can guarantee who will like it, who will say \"Meh\", and who will not like it. I recommend it to Gundam fans, but I can\\'t really recommend it as a starting point to anyone.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd37a467b1dffbae9bf623315750402b3'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'With the creator and director Tomino coming off of severe depression, the Gundam series went a different direction. The first being Victory Gundam and the second being this one in Turn A Gundam. This would be the eighth installment in the Gundam franchise and has been confirmed that Turn A takes place thousands of years after the events of Gundam in the Universal Century.\\nOur setting is Earth in which it and humanity has finally recovered enough after the Gundam wars. More so, the people living in space want to return to Earth. The main protagonist, Loran, is one of three sent by the moon queen\\nto scout the Earth and its’ people to see if A) the Earth is again habitable and B) even worth returning to. Loran quickly adapts to the Earth, which is at a state in technology about during the industrial revolution. Quickly, the advanced Moon Race settle on Earth, and of course, the Earthlings are less than willing to cooperate with the quick-draw militia of the spacenoids.\\nFirst problem is the plot is incredibly slow. This Gundam show has been stated for pacing issues boarding that of unwatchable. Second problem are the characters. People in Turn A Gundam are generally weak minded, trope ridden, and frustratingly stupid. One pro is this anime is filled with very strong willed female characters or the main ones at least. Unfortunately, people in the anime are poorly developed and the choices they make constantly make the viewer scratch their head. One great example is how quickly characters and militia members easily switch allegiances. Sure the beginning of Turn A Gundam is intriguing and different, but much like Gundam X is far from close to reaching the initial potential. The first 15 episodes have plenty of politics and military struggles, but from basically start to finish the battles are very repetitive, and dialogue just drags to the point of boredom.\\nBeing 50 episodes, the art and animation is that of late 80’s quality than that of turning the millennium. But, can’t fault for a stretched budget. However, fault can be put on bland character designs and even less imaginative writing. At least the music and sound were superb.\\nIn short, much like Gundam X, Turn A Gundam maybe could have been much better made as a 24-ish episode anime as opposed to the long run previous series had. This Gundam series suffers greatly from terrible pacing, insufferable character writing, and battles that just are not interesting. It simply is not worth watching even as a Gundam fan.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '82afa0e5fe8510a5f8a60d86bf1be5be'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Turn A Gundam was created to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Gundam franchise and is directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino. Being of a different continuity than the Universal Century timeline, Turn A made for some of the best material I seen for an alternate continuity to the Gundam franchise thus far. Rather than try ripping ideas from the Universal Century continuity and/or get into overblown antics like Gundam Wing, SEED and G Gundam, Turn A Gundam implements its own ideas and mecha designs to a great extent here.\\nTurn A depicts a time thousands of years in the future where the space battles of old have\\nleft Earth in an Industrial Age-like state and those who ventured into space on the moon continued to advance their technologies from that time. The conflict that arises between the Moonrace and Earth people create some interesting tensions with multiple factions formed within each group trying to grab power for themselves and claim superiority for their race or agenda. A number of characters that are introduced seemingly appear good or evil on the surface, but appearances are deceiving as the series does provide details on the backgrounds and beliefs of said characters where their motives become justified and they can be sympathized with. The series also does a solid job exploring the political and social issues plaguing both factions such as discrimination, planetary colonization and military corruption.\\nUnlike Tomino\\'s earlier work with the Universal Century titles of the Gundam franchise, Turn A is a bit more light-hearted in exploring the tensions between Moonrace and Earth. While the series still features the trademark fighting mobile suits of both factions in war and not being afraid to kill off some characters, Turn A doesn\\'t go for its character killing on major characters and it isn\\'t as dark with its plot twists as you would find with Tomino\\'s involvement in older Gundam works. The series carries some humor with it that is used well to balance out its more serious scenes and it doesn\\'t get in the way of the mood for the series when things get heated.\\nAlong with the show\\'s more lighter plot, Turn A Gundam also sports plenty of original mecha designs for this take on the Gundam franchise, which are quite unique compared to the designs used in other Gundam titles I\\'ve seen that still bare resemblance to the original RX-78 Gundam and Zeon models of the original series. For some of the designs, they serve different functions on the battlefield rather than the human-like characteristics and actions adopted with mobile suits from other titles. Beyond the mecha designs, Turn A\\'s scenery and character designs are standard late-90s animation with some implementation of CG animation used with rendering of computer specs and some complex methods of animation like an asteroid used by Moonrace queen Dianna as a personal sanctuary that is seen later in the series. Yoko Kanno does contribute her composure talents for Turn A\\'s soundtrack with the musical tracks, as usual, being catchy and doing very well at complimenting the various scenes that music is used in.\\nA major flaw with the series in my eyes though would have to be aspects to its characterization. While a number of characters are reasonably fleshed out, there are others that feel more like they are products of the show\\'s plot who are around to either push the plot into a certain direction or tacked on with some sort of archetype instead of feeling like a normal person. Unfortunately, Loran\\'s very character is one of those said archetypes as he doesn\\'t have much complexity to his personality like you would find with Amuro or Zeta Gundam\\'s Kamille and there isn\\'t any change in his character throughout the series as he is still the same kind-hearted, peace-loving young man who is \"always right\" with his actions.\\nSetting aside this major flaw though, Turn A Gundam was the first alternative continuity title in the Gundam franchise that I did get a reasonable amount of enjoyment with thanks to its unique take on the franchise\\'s trademark themes and its engaging plot developments.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd60f5ac97582afc9fa8a77263e4f9081'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Pretty much all franchises have at least one show that you kinda have to wonder “What the hell were they even thinking?”. Gundam actually has two of these. The first was G Gundam, which I’ve already reviewed and as I said, it was awesome. But then there’s the other one: Turn A Gundam. Ironic given that Tomino actually came back for this show. I don’t know how he managed to do this considering his fallout with Sunrise, but whatever. Anyhow, let’s see what this mess is all about.\\nStory:\\nThe setting is probably the most unique thing about this show. It’s set in an almost steampunk like\\nenvironment, right in the middle of the industrial revolution. This also causes us to see the characters having to adapt to the new Mobile Weapons they have, as they likely never even existed before this show started, at least to the people of Earth. Then there is the moon, which is basically a traditional Gundam colony on crack. It serves to put a nice contrast between the two, and both are developed quite well.\\nAdditionally, if I could compare the conflict in the show to anything; it would be that it is the Gundam version of the Cold War. Nobody wants to go into war with each other, the conflicts are usually of a slower scale, and a bunch of the show is the leaders of both sides trying their best to not go into an all-out war, as no one wants that. There are multiple times when we see people trying their best to live with this difficult situation, and how strenuous it is. To say the least, it’s not particularly easy to create a Neutral Zone in this world.\\nThat said, there two things that prevent me from fully loving this show. For one thing, the pacing is SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW. While I do appreciate some world-building, this show probably takes it up a notch, as the problem isn’t that there are multiple episodes that nothing happens, but that something happens in every episode, but it’s more like they’re giving you a small nugget of information and then nothing else. Also, as many have pointed out, the general quality of the story is much lower in the second half. It’s still good, just not as good as it used to be.\\nAnd of course, I can’t talk about this show without talking about the Black History. For anyone who doesn’t want to be spoiled, skip the following paragraph. Anyhow, the Black History heavily implies that all Gundam universes end in Turn A. As in, no matter which universe you’re in, Turn A will be the finale of it. Tomino actually wanted to go even further and claim that this was also the case for other shows he had made like Zambot 3 and Daitarn 3, but Sunrise didn’t allow that. I can understand why so many others love this concept, but I don’t because, well, it makes everything they’ve done useless. Think about it, all the struggles out heroes went through in those series, all of the sacrifices done for the sake of peace… and yet due to the Black History, they were for nothing. Now some people have argued that this only applies to the pre-Turn A shows as there are far too many continuity issues for this to apply to stuff like 00 or IBO (Apparently, I admit I haven’t seen it yet), but my point still stands. Needless to say, I’d much rather prefer if this show was just yet another AU Gundam.\\nCharacters:\\nGoing away from the negativity for a second, this show has a fantastic cast. Loran is… okay. He’s far from my favorite Gundam protagonist, but he’s not bad either. He does deserve credit for being the only pacifist Gundam protagonist who pulls it off right (Bar Banagher from Unicorn, but more on him in another date). For one thing the conflict he’s stuck in actually allows him to be a pacifist. The war hasn’t fully broken out by the time the show starts, so killing people would actually make things worse. Also, he has to try. That’s what pisses me off so much about Kira Yamato, he can just effortlessly disable all Mobile Suits without even trying. With Loran, he has to try out every possible method he can find, and when they don’t work, he WILL kill his opponent. Thankfully he’s a crafty little bastard, so he’s only forced to kill, like, five people over the course of the show, and I’m pretty sure at least one of those was accidental.\\nNo, the actual hightlight of the show is Queen Dianna Soriel, the best Pacifist Princess character in Gundam. Dianna starts off seemingly simple, she believes that, as the Moonrace was originally from Earth, they deserve to have their own part of it. She doesn’t hate the Earthlings, or anything, she just wants a small bit of land for her people to settle on. Of course she does so in a rather sudden manner, however she doesn’t realize the exact consequences of her actions until she’s forced to come face to face with all of the horrors she’s created. By the end, she legitimately does repent her actions and wish for the better of both worlds, and that she could’ve handled the situation in a far better manner. Better yet, while she is technically a pacifist, she isn’t afraid to pull a gun and shoot someone in the head when necessary.\\nThe rest of the cast does an excellent job at being interesting. The only one I didn’t like was Sochie, who got on my nerves really fast, basically being Louise from 00 without anything that made Louise interesting. By contrast, my favorite character ended up being Harry Ord, who’s basically (As a YouTube commenter once said) The protagonist and the antagonist of a Hot-Blooded Super Robot series that somehow ended up in a Gundam series. Needless to say, he’s legitimately that awesome. And of course, the big bad, Gym Ghingham is a loud, boisterous bastard and I love him.\\nAnimation:\\nThe show looks damn fine for the early 2000’. Not much stock footage is used, though it never quite reaches the same heights as the other 90’ Gundam series reached. Not helped that sometimes they used flash animation to do some of the explosions and it looks jarring as hell. Still though, it’s definitely a good looking show to say the least.\\nThe Mecha:\\nWell… the Turn A Gundam. One of the weirdest Gundams yet, designed by Syd Mead of all people… I really like it. Yeah, it’s different, but in a good way, to the point I had to get used to the bulkier looks of all other Gundams after watching this show. The Turn X isn’t exactly my cup of tea, but I can see why others may like it. Beside them, the only other MS that stood out was Harry Ord’s Gold Sumo, which is pretty damn great, if I may say so myself.\\nSound:\\nI mean… it’s Kano Youko. Do I even need to explain how good the soundtrack is? I do? Okay then, so,  for this occasion, she goes for a full on orchestra, which sounds amazing, with “Moonlight Butterfly” in particular being one of the greatest themes in all of Gundam. As for the openings, while it did take some time to grow on me, I ended up loving “Turn A Turn”, and the same goes for “Century Colours”.  As for the Endings, my favorite was \"Kagiri naki Tabiji”.\\nVoice Acting:\\nThe cast is comprised mostly by actors who were relatively unknown at the time, though due to the passing of time a good lot of them are quite popular. Most notably is Park Romi as Loran, who did a pretty good job. Inada Tetsu got his big break through this show, and let’s just say not a single bit of ham was left unchewed. And of course, Koyasu Takehito goes all out as Gym Ghingham, this easily being his hammiest Gundam performance. Special mention to Takahashi Rieko, who had to voice two characters, and while they sound similar, there is enough difference so that you can tell them aside. Beside them, there’s also Fukuyama Jun, Natsuki Rio, Watanabe Kumiko, Ugaki Hidenari, Otani Ikue, Touchi Hiroki and Honda Takako.\\nOverall:\\nTurn A Gundam is a great show, and it’s more than deserving of its status as a cult classic. I may not love it as much as others do, but even I can’t deny its overall quality. I can’t quite recommend it as a gateway Gundam due to how different the show is from all other Gundam series, but needless to say, it is a must watch for all Gundam fans.\\nFinal Score: 8/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f860b6e4e763fa27e49d2f9194763654'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Akage no Anne doesn’t seem to be a particularly grand story if one was to simply read the blurb - there are no dramatic plot twists, no tyrants to defeat, no epic quest spanning galaxies - it is just a very simple tale of a young orphaned girl coming to terms with herself and others.\\nAkage no Anne takes place in the late nineteenth century, in the fictional town of Avonlea on Prince Edwards Island, Canada. Here siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both reaching into their 50's and 60's, are looking to adopt a boy of around 10 to help them with the farm work.\\nThe story begins with the very shy and soft-spoken Matthew  heading towards the train station to pick up their new adopted boy, averting his eyes from every women he passes along the way. However, when Matthew arrives at the train station there is no boy to be found. Instead there is a freckled 11 year old girl with red hair, named Anne Shirley.\\nIt is through this deceptively simple premise that Akage no Anne explores the many complex issues that arise during everyday life, with remarkable results. The broad scope in which it paints these complex themes is rather unassuming at first, but through the slow, naturalistic building of its large cast of characters and nuanced examination of the whys and wherefores of everyday life, Akage no Anne manages to achieve a magic that absolutely deserves to be experienced.\\nAnne, like many 11 year-olds, is a very flawed individual. She is obstinate, talks incessantly, and is very easily distracted. Her mood swings wildly from one moment to the next and she frequently prioritizes her latest whim over what really needs to be done. For years she carries an obdurate hatred of a certain character simply because he teased her once. Yet these are hardly the deplorable characteristics they may seem at first; rather, they are what makes her such a human character and, in turn, such a relatable one as well. Humans are naturally flawed beings and Anne is no exception. Nevertheless, these imperfections are hardly the unidimensional character traits one may have become accustomed to in anime. Her wild mood swings denotes her uniquely passionate temperament for the dramatic and the romantic. Distractions are often for the sake of more creative endeavors. Her whimsy is a large part of what makes her such an endearing character, both to those around her and the audience. Whenever Anne is given the chance to learn or experience something new, she always takes to the task with a great sense of purpose. All of these points considered, Anne is an incredibly realistic and human character, and you can't help but relate to her because of that.\\nAnd true to real life, Anne's depth of characterization, and rationalization of this characterization, takes root in the detailings of her past. Both of her parents died of typhoid fever when she was only three months of age. She was then placed into the care of the very poor Thomas family, only to be sent to live with the Hammond family and subsequently sent to an orphanage at an even later date. Throughout these early years of her life, she was often unfairly berated and forced to toil away at household chores day in and day out, never permitted to attend school or make any friends. It is through these harsh formative years that Anne's personality had already begun taking shape. She sought refuge from her unfavorable living conditions by escaping into stories, poems, books and her characteristic vivid imagination. The books and poems she had read established her penchant for theatrics and her lyrical soliloquies early on. She was never given the chance to experience many of the things the world has to offer, so she had to fill in the blanks of life with her imagination. Her imagination could also be seen as her only tool of contending with these tribulations by way of envisioning her standings in life as a much more extravagant, romantic one.\\nMost of this, however, isn't disclosed quite this explicitly in the actual show. Yes, Anne does go into her history briefly, but not in such great detail, and she certainly doesn’t dissect her past crucibles and their innate effect on her psyche; all of that is merely implicit. The writing at play here omits any superfluous details or things that can be easily ascertained by the attentive viewer/reader in favor of a more realistic approach of characterization. Things aren't learned by means of awkward expository dialogue, nor are they dictated via haphazard, unwieldy info-dumps - everything is simply conveyed to the audience in a very candid and natural manner, as if we were only peeking in on a small slice of their lives never intended for such a large audience. For instance, Anne’s compendious and slightly hesitant admission that her former caretakers “meant to be good to her” effortlessly says so much more about Anne than a more typical and unnaturally overt explanation of the same thing could ever accomplish. This graceful method of storytelling feels refreshingly alien in today’s modern anime landscape; the narrative is there for our exploring and Akage no Anne’s narrative is a very, very gratifying place to explore, start to finish.\\nFurthermore, the show wastes little time in establishing some of its interesting character dynamics. Matthew is almost instantly charmed by Anne upon meeting her and doesn't have the heart to tell her that they had asked for a boy. He’d rather leave that for Marilla to sort out. On the way to Green Gables, Anne recites these sprawling, melodramatic, nearly poetic speeches while Matthew just listens, enraptured. Anne's fanciful monologues serve as a perfect introduction to her unique world view: She details how much she hates her red hair, her love of romanticism, and how lovely it is to finally have a place she can call home, all the while frequently and impulsively changing the topic to whatever else catches her fancy at that exact fleeting moment. Although Matthew doesn't speak much during this carriage ride, his expressive face says more than words could ever say. It's an absolute delight to see how rapt he hangs on Anne’s every word and how quickly he becomes attached to this unusual little girl during their relatively short carriage ride home together when only moments earlier he was averting his eyes in fear in the passing of a few harmless women alongside the road. The effect is very understated but pulled off remarkably well. Thankfully, one can expect many more moments like this throughout the show.\\nOn the other hand, Marilla, a much more pragmatic person than Matthew, isn't as keen on the idea of keeping Anne, initially. After all, the reason they wanted to adopt a kid in the first place was for help tending the farm, and the skinny Anne hardly seems fit for the job. Furthermore, Anne’s loud, dramatic, fanciful character is the polar opposite of the more subdued and sensible Marilla, so her idiosyncrasies are met with reproach at first. Still, after some careful deliberation following Anne and Marilla having shared a few bonding opportunities, it is decided that Marilla and Matthew will allow Anne to stay at Green Gables and Marilla would raise Anne as her daughter. Akage no Anne remains very much about Anne's coming of age, but the way the story accomplishes this is through a series of vignettes portraying the ups and downs of her everyday life. For the first time in her life, she is allowed to truly experience life and all that entails: going to school, making friends, and experiencing all the exciting little things in life that we might have come to consider mundane, making all the mistakes that children tend to make along the way. The way Anne grows from these experiences, though, is so natural, gradual, and nuanced that it can be easy to miss entirely until its climax creeps up on the viewer. The final moments of this series are so rewarding, so moving, so poignant in its magnificently understated beauty; all of these seemingly disparate and insignificant moments in Anne's life coalesce and culminate in ways that make each and every one of said vignettes at once meaningful, evoking a palpable warmth that could only have been achieved in this slow, naturalistic method of storytelling that Akage no Anne pulls off so well.\\nStill, this wealth of narrative excellence would all be for naught if just one of the nuts and bolts working behind the scenes were to fall out of place. A story can and will go to pieces if the pacing is just slightly off, so good storyboarding is vital. Scenes that were emotionally gripping or heartrending in the novel can be met with blasé dispassion if it that particular scene isn’t interpreted properly by the screenwriter and director. Skillful voice acting is absolutely integral in conveying the vast breadth of emotion present in this character driven story. Even the smallest oversight in the consistency in the setting can completely take a viewer out of the immersive quality. Storyboarding, screenwriting, direction, voice acting, music, art direction, and, especially in the case of Akage no Anne, a well researched setting are all integral apportioned components of a larger whole. If just one of those cogs isn’t working in perfect accordance with the rest, then the narrative, no matter how excellent, can falter irreparably into an inefficacious mess. It is fortunate, then, that Akage no Anne is every bit as exemplary technically as it is narratively.\\nAs I see it, the reason that the novel upon which Akage no Anne is based on, 'Anne of Green Gables' by Lucy Maud Montgomery, has resonated with so many people around the world for over a hundred years now is in no small part due to its decidedly realistic approach of depicting the magic of everyday life. Isao Takahata, the director of Akage no Anne, is able to capture this magic brilliantly. The direction on display here is nothing short of awe-inspiring. While it would have been incredibly easy for Takahata to indulge in schmaltz or cheap melodramatics, the anime in adaptation never falls into emotional trickery or manipulation of the audience, despite Anne's habitually melodramatic disposition. Emotional moments are felt because they are genuinely emotional. Through the show’s slow and realistic pacing, we, the audience, grow to love the characters, cherish their bonds, and partake vicariously through their hardships and triumphs just as Anne and her new family do, very naturally. The way Takahata brings Anne's tribulations to life are easy to relate to precisely by the virtue of how inherently human every single aspect of them is and how informally they all play out. It doesn't matter where you are from, nor which era you are a part of, because everyone has felt the things Anne feels, and, in one way or another, experienced the same things Anne has. That kind of timeless, all-encompassing humanity has to be admired, and to that effect, so does Isao Takahata for capturing it.\\nIt is, however, when the predominantly realistic tone gives way to the expressionistic reverie of Anne's imagination that Takahata’s artistry undoubtedly shines brightest. A brief carriage ride through a wooded path seamlessly metamorphosizes into a magical scene in which Anne is in an instant wearing a long, white dress, being lifted up into the sky by a geyser of flowers while this wondrous, fanciful orchestral tune plays; it's an absolutely stunning way of putting us directly into Anne's otherworldly fantasies. Anne's imagination is so fundamental to who she is that it only makes sense for Takahata to bring her thoughts to life existentially just as Anne envisions them. This extraordinary contrast between realism and expressionism is something that Takahata really excels at, and this motif of his has never had more suitable home to lay its proverbial hat than the in world of Akage no Anne.\\nThe accuracy with which Montgomery's text is transformed into this dazzling piece of animation is without comparison. Takahata's flourishes aside, Akage no Anne is an almost word for word, gesture for gesture, scene for scene adaptation. The setting is well researched and just as described in the novel, with its scenic background art done in a lovely picturesque painterly effect. Hayao Miyazaki handles the scene setting and layout. Yoshifumi Kondo, who would later go on to direct the classic Whisper of the Heart, handles the simple yet serviceable character design that, as with just about everything else, is very accurate to the source material. Animation direction is handled by Kondo and if there is any weak link in Akage no Anne, animation is probably it. The show was made in 1979 and it shows, especially in some of the later episodes. It’s largely to be expected and never becomes too distracting, but it bore mentioning. Music is another area where it would have been incredibly easy for it to succumb to the pitfalls of cloying melodrama, but it’s fairly restrained, yet coolly affecting and melancholy when need be. Anne is a near inimitable character so Eiko Yamada’s spectacular interpretation of her is especially praiseworthy.\\nStill, there are several minor dis-similarities between the novel and anime, but outside of a few conspicuous omissions, I’m pleased to report that most of the changes were for the better. Akage no Anne makes incredible use of all fifty of its episodes, so some important character relationships are better fleshed out and a key part of Anne's life is given more care and attention than in the novel thanks to the anime’s lengthy run time. It’s such a rarity for an adaptation to even come close to equaling the quality of it’s source material, so the fact that Akage no Anne manages to by and large improve upon it’s source without losing an ounce of its magic merits special praise indeed, especially considering the prestigious stature of the Anne of Green Gables novel.\\nAnd everything comes together splendidly; each one of the aforementioned formal cogs amalgamate flawlessly with each other and with Montgomery’s already outstanding writing to form something truly timeless and deserving of being called a masterpiece. I've stressed humanity so much in this review because, ultimately, I think that’s what has made Akage no Anne resonate with such a large number of people around the world for so many years now. Its lasting popularity in modern day Japan - a place and time that couldn’t be further from nineteenth century Prince Edward Island, Canada - is a testament to this. Just as Anne had a profound effect upon the lives of those around her, she has truly had a similarly profound effect upon the lives of people around the world for generations upon generations now, and I imagine she will continue to do so for many more; and just that is Anne's greatest magic.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6282ed024fe7f3dbf32a03dbdfd09e11'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"The year is 1876 and the Second Industrial Revolution is at its dawn. The world was only a few years away from witnessing the wonders of electricity. Countless technological innovations in the industry, in an ever-growing scheme, are slowly shaping a whole new spectrum of efficient and flexible methods of production. In order to satiate a ravenous hunger for power and resources, Europe's Imperialistic giants once again turn their eyes towards the vast lands of Africa and Asia.\\nMeanwhile, in Prince Edward Island, Canada; life follows its course as if unaware of the changes around the globe. Rural lifestyles without much commotion characterize the\\npeople of Avonlea, a fictional town that the characters of this story call home. Somewhere in town, Matthew Cuthbert is heading out in his carriage for a rare appearance outdoors. It turns out a male orphan was adopted, and the grizzled man was on his way to pick up the boy at the train station. In the days of old, the idea of raising an unknown child was frowned upon by many on account of the risks that came along with it. But Matthew's younger sister, Marilla Cuthbert, understands that change is necessary. As years went by, the ceaseless march of time began to slowly take its toll on the elder's body, which is with each passing day having more and more difficulties in dealing with the heavy workload of the farm. But now, with an easier lifestyle guaranteed, the closing stages of Matthew's journey seem certain to follow a calm final course. However, as he approaches the station, some sort of grave mistake seems to have occurred. Why, for what sort of reason is there a red-haired girl instead of a boy waiting for his arrival…?\\nAnd thus begins the coming of age story of Anne Shirley of Green Gables. An orphan since her infancy, Anne wandered from place to place for most of her life without the care of a true family. Due to this precarious lifestyle, an intense longing for a place to call home grew with the passing of time. With almost no one to rely on or receive a proper upbringing from, she would often find solace in the world of books and her imagination as means to keep herself in high spirits. As a form of escapism, Anne's love for literature and the imaginary would slowly begin to mold her dynamic and radiant persona.\\nThe child who arrived at Green Gables, though only eleven years old, was more mature than her age would suggest. Anne's early childhood, while truly difficult, contributed to developing a certain degree of self-dependence. Often under emotional pressure and dealing with heavy workloads, she was forced to adapt to the conditions imposed by the unfavorable environment. But beyond that, they also created a deep sense of humility and inner strength within her—rather than becoming downhearted, Anne learned to find happiness amidst pain. As someone able to enjoy the littlest things in life, even an ordinary day feels splendid to her. Despite showing slight signs of vanity, this immense gratitude towards the world is what keeps Anne from being a spoilt and selfish child. In face of this, Marilla, even if entirely against the idea of adoption at first, slowly develops a profound appreciation for the girl's sincerity and gumption.\\nAnne's subsequent endeavors, through honest mistakes and awkward scrapes, are both genuine and amusing, playing an essential role in her growth as a person. Intertwined with her coming of age, various branches explore the cracks and corners of childhood. Be it with the little girl who longs for life-long friendships, or the diligent student who strives for excellence in every undertaken task, or the matured teenager who is conflicted due to the bigger responsibilities that come with age; there's always aspects one can easily relate to. With each passing episode, the viewer gradually gets to know more about the apprehensions, aspirations and fancies that inhabit the young protagonist's mind. And in similar pace, the audience witnesses the flow of time that so pervades human life.\\nTime: an ever-changing and constant stream of events that shapes and changes everything around civilization, from the world's landscapes and oceans to a person's personality and appearance. In the same manner that it brings good things, it also takes away. In Akage no Anne, this concept is conveyed through Anne's growth and the changes within the environment after her arrival. Conceptually, the very premise of the story is rooted deep in the notion that life is subject to time and chance. Matthew, who's in his sixties, is with each passing day showing more symptoms of age, and he is no longer is able to keep up with the tiring farm work as he once did. Marilla, although still not short of vigor, is already past the midpoint of her life's journey, and her eyes no longer work as well as in the past. Ever since the siblings' parents died, only the two of them have been living in the house, and as they grew older and older, the place took on a silent and solemn atmosphere. The orphan's arrival at their abode, however, marks the beginning of a new era. Anne's grateful and vivacious nature brings a vitality and color long lost in the house, acting as a catalyst for mutual growth between the residents that gradually starts resembling that of a unified family.\\nHowever, witnessing the heartfelt relationship between Anne, Matthew and Marilla as they grow together as a family and deal with the tribulations of life is only part of the journey. Beyond the basic premise, Akage no Anne is a subtle yet insightful look into the etiquettes, norms and principles that form the foundation for the identity of the inhabitants of Avonlea. Similarly to the home environment, institutions like school play a critical role in shaping the mindsets of people. Understated in nature, this theme is explored simply through the daily doings and interactions of the cast—something easily discerned by an attentive viewing.\\nUnder Marilla's supervision, Anne is taught important societal norms and values. Being a woman whose entire life was built around a set of principles, her main objective is to thoroughly instill these values into Anne. The child's constant lack of concentration and understanding of social norms is seen by Marilla as a big problem that needs fixing. However, contrary to her stern image, the 52-year-old doesn't adopt a needlessly stringent method of teaching, instead allowing Anne to experience a joyful childhood free of unnecessary restrictions.\\nConsidering the importance of education in the story's context, school is seen as an integral part of the community's culture and one's development. Fairly unfamiliar to Anne prior to coming to Green Gables, school becomes a pivotal environment in her growth as a young girl. A nurturing place of learning, it is in there where Anne's mind flourishes intellectually. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Anne's teacher, Mrs. Stacy, was a godsend to her. Being one of the very few adults to ever encourage the girl's creative mind and intense use of imagination, she becomes an invaluable role model for the impressionable Anne. Of immense importance over time, school opens a multitude of doors for the diligent student. But among everything, the greatest thing it awarded was an important goal in life: the possibility of attending college and graduating.\\nAnne's process of maturation—subtly perceptible in its early stage, and immense in the long run—is slow and nuanced. As life unfolds, Anne gains size, becomes more self-dependent and responsible, prioritizes more 'grown-up' activities, and develops more lady-like manners. She starts becoming more of a socially respectable person, blossoming into a teenager with a number of aspirations...\\nAnd so the little Anne grows up. The talkative redhead who used to constantly indulge in her flights of fancy and get into the most unusual situations, experiences a new stage in life where ambitions and life goals reside. However, her worldview, albeit more seasoned, remains fundamentally the same. Anne's gratitude for the smallest of things in life and her explosive imagination are inherent qualities, and will remain ingrained in her psyche for as long as she lives. As the protagonist herself says later in the story, even if grown up physically and mentally, the vivid and imaginative little Anne will always be there. And this, indeed, is what makes Anne Shirley such an extraordinary personality.\\nSubtle too, is the way how Marilla, through the daily contact with Anne, begins to cultivate a maternal sense dormant within her dutiful shell. The rigid and stern house-owner gradually gives way to a more lenient and mellow person. However, Anne has also changed. When the once hard-hearted woman is confronted with the matured teenager, reality hits like a rock. The overemotional and talkative Anne she once learned to love vanishes, and gives place to a self-composed youngster. Despite still loving the girl as much as when she was just a little child, Marilla finds herself unable to shrug off this queer, sorrowful sense of loss. Life never stops moving forward, and sooner or later, everyone stands at the crossroads of life, and what is loved won't be around anymore. Seemingly simple at first glance, it is quotidian situations like this in Akage no Anne that most richly convey the nuances of human life. The more grown-up Anne embodies the transition between childhood and adolescence, and all the small joys and little mistakes that molded her into a stronger person for the first time demonstrate their true significance. Marilla's conflicting, bittersweet emotions illustrate not only the reluctance of a parent seeing their child moving into a new life stage, losing some of the innocent charm in the process, but one who wholeheartedly embraces the blossoming youth. Here, it is displayed the natural method through which Akage no Anne's narrative conveys introspection and character development. In this case, the build-up started back in the very moment when Anne made her way into Green Gables, culminating with substantial personal and interpersonal developments within the family.\\nThe resplendent mosaic of Akage no Anne—solid in its individual pieces, brilliant in its entirety—is proof that even the simplest concepts can be assembled together in order to create something truly masterful. All serving a common purpose, both the small and big pieces of Anne's life story mean something in the grand scheme of things, coalescing into a cohesive whole that is undoubtedly far greater than the sum of the parts. The laid-back storytelling, as if inviting the audience to experience the lives of the characters, is slow and meticulous in exploring the trivialities and intricacies of daily life—it is a casual, and above everything, sincere method of characterization and development of themes that go beyond time and place. The unfolding of the cast's lives and routines is the form by which Akage no Anne's storytelling so naturally conveys its messages. Through the slow build-up of routine, the audience truly gets to know Anne, those closely related to her, their individual worlds, and how they change and mold each other through the passing of time. They are dynamic personalities, and more importantly, something more than mere narrative devices. And this, consequently, is what makes Akage no Anne's cast so believably human through their joys and struggles, and its themes so universal. People grow, people live, and people change. And so does Green Gables and its residents.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '815d60925f1731781b4293b544c7091f'}>,\n",

One of the other things I liked was the use of fairytale and mythological creatures in the show. The females gondoliers are referred to as Undines, with the top three being called the Great Fairies. The weather is controlled by salamanders, the gravity is controlled by gnomes, etc. One thing that puzzled me was why the female characters names begin with A (except Grandma, however her real name is Akino), but that's by-the-by.\\nSo the important question is: Will you enjoy the show?\\nIf you're an action junkie, or into horror or angst, then this is not the show for you (although it never hurts to give it a try). This show is funny and quirky in many ways, without going over the top, but the one word I would use to describe the show is RELAX. It took me two weeks to finish this show and it's sequel (which is a long time for me by the way), and this is because this show is so relaxing that I was falling asleep whilst watching it. Normally it takes a lot for me to fall asleep, and even boredom doesn't work, but somehow this show just relaxes you to the point where you just drift off to dreamland without a second thought, and never once was I bored with this show.\\nOverall this is a show that deserves to be watched, as it has a unique appeal that the like's of Sketchbook ~full colour'S~ and Kokoro Toshokan just can't quite match up to. The reason why the non-linear story works well in this show is because it's so relaxing that you honestly just don't care about the fact there's no real plot - which is a rather refreshing perspective to have.\\nThe best way to watch the show? Have a shower, have a good meal, get comfortable, and relax...\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'dbf7246efc7806ecc35203cdba1bdca9'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"I stumbled upon Aria years ago when reading a review about the manga and made a mental note to check it out later. Positively drawn in by Kozue Amano's original work, I soon picked up the anime as well. For a reason I still can't recall I dropped the show nearly three years ago, and it wasn't until just recently that I finished what I started back then. And though not much had changed for either better or worse from what I remembered, I'm glad I did so.\\nAria the Animation is not for you, who prefers a clear cut and classically constructed storyline that moves\\nfrom point A to point B with some key events in between. Aria the Animation is not for you, who requires relentless action and constant fast-paced happenings from their anime. And most certainly Aria the Animation is not for you, who finds little to no enjoyment in just sitting back and watching as a close-knit group of girls, not in their bra and panties with guns ablaze, but with their gondolas and oars go through ordinary day-to-day activities instead of epic adventures and intense situations.\\nBut on the good chance you are the type to approach your anime with an open mind and the patience to watch and see the magic in the moment, you are likely to find the company of Akari, Aika, Alice, and the rest of the undines and undines-in-training much to your liking. Because that's what Aria the Animation is ultimately about: a journey to uncover the joy of the obvious, the excitement behind the mundane, and the possibilities underneath the sorrows.\\nThese scenarios are played out to us by a cast of characters who depict a variety of different personalities. Akari is the naive amateur who treats all she experiences with childlike wonder; through her most of the show's message is brought across to the viewer. . Aika is her best friend and almost her exact opposite: no-nonsense and feet firmly on the ground-kind of girl who constantly berates Akari for her dreamy ways. And Alicia is their mentor and the big sister-type of character, who's there to provide insight and help the juniors along the way. They're surrounded by a pack of friends who similarly have their quirks and qualities defining them and making their role contributing to what the creator is trying to tell us.\\nYou're right if you argue that the story is boring and seemingly pointless at times. Saying the characters being archetypes of their respective personalities (and almost exclusively female as well!) is cliche and overused is valid. Complaining that having cats as business company presidents is just plain stupid and ridiculous is justified.\\nBut as one who no doubt has already seen quite a bit of anime in their life, you have for sure come across these common failings before. And in case you've reached the point of having made peace with them, or feel like challenging yourself to do so, Aria the Animation may prove to be an eye-opening experience for you that anime can be good even if no heavens are pierced.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8f6a6b6b10c69c5113cdca435860f6f4'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': '\"May this town\\'s kindness reach the hearts of many people...\"\\nFrom what I saw, I\\'m sure it will.\\nThe first idea I wanted to share in this review is that Aria is a series that speaks for itself. What I\\'m doing here is merely trying to explain a complex story within a few lines. I would never be able to summarize all the pros/cons of Aria, first because each person will see it in a deferent way, and second because you would need to watch it in order to understand all the comparisons, metaphores and symbolism I would mention.\\nThat said, I\\'m reviewing it with the\\nsole purpose of bringing more viewers for this amazing chronicle and hopefully introduce more and more people to Aqua and its habitants.\\nAria is an anime that everybody should watch, still, it\\'s not an anime that will work for everybody. Whether or not you will enjoy it, is up to you, your personal interpretation and the mood of the moment. I would say that what matters the most is the timing. If you watch it while in the mood for a thriller, you\\'ll drop it even before understanding the idea of the story.\\n\"Now, please take my hand\"\\nIs what you would heard from a radiant Undiine while boarding her gondola. With a gentle smile she would gracefully ask you where to and start conducing you trought Neo-Venezia, a city modeled after Venezia in Man-Home (Earth). She would show you turistic spots and you\\'d start to notice that even being in 2053 the city moves slowly, without traffic jams, rush hour, polution, cellphones, noise pollution... The only evidences that you are really in the XXII century would be the spaceships that are continually transporting passangers from one planet to another. This relaxed athmosphere would start to embrace you while the Undiine continue to show you wonders and misteries from this planet that were once dry and empty and is now filled with water and life.\\nIt\\'s impossible to not enjoy such cozy enviroment.\\nEvery episode is a kind of fairy tale, filled with cultural values and a sense of friendship, always coming up with a poetic moral in the end. Aria stands out from the average and prove us that the essence of the Slice-Of-Life is not dead. Characters can be lovely and elegant without being \"moe\". All the great stories in human history never needed movies or TV series to be remembered, they passed from generation to generation depending only in the power of words and its storyteller. Aria didn\\'t have a high budget, neither big sponsors, so the quality of the animation could never be compared to a \"top\" studio, even though, the artwork values itself from this modest simplicity, that even with a medium quality, brings you gorgeous scenarios and handsome characters.\\nAt this point you probably already noticed that Aria raise some questions a regular slice-of-life doesn\\'t. This is only possible because of two main reasons: The already mentioned storyline progression, that works with a character-driven story and a \"not-so-linear\" time progression, and the well said characters.\\nUsually what you see is a cast made of a group of high schoolers in a school enviroment, 99% of the slice-of-life stories are like this. Not saying they are bad, but it only provides a unilateral point of view from a given subject. Of course each character, if well planned, will have a difference in personality and see things in a different way, otherwise it would get boring to watch. Aria on the other hand change things in a \"macro\" way, and brings a entire community as characters. Works with different generations and people with the most different styles of life and personality traces, bringing to you a much more rich story  that resemble our lifes.\\nIt stays apparent whenever or not a studio made an effort to create something special when one of the basic points of a series steals the show. Financial issues or other external factors can put a \"barrier\" to graphics, effects, art, post-production development, but sound is relatively free from it. Music can be made by anyone, anywhere. Anonymous people can create masterpieces, and some kid can be playing right now a perfect cover of Beethoven. Why am I saying this?\\nBecause Aria\\'s music deserve to be praised. Wonderful acoustic pieces by Choro Club and Senoo was the perfect match for the enviroment of the series. The entire OST is performed with string instruments (even a rhodes) without any kind of pop song or eletronic. The songs are slow paced, almost hitting a andante and sometimes a vivace, while the vocal collection are mostly ballads. It\\'s undoubtedly the best choice of OST for a story with the values of Aria.\\nCan you fell the nostalgia already?\\nAria made something special here.\\nI wish not enter in the merit of originality but it is perceptible that after its publication, lots of other franchises started producing series which bended more to this side of a philosophical slice-of-life with tones of self-discovery on it. One could say the strenght of this series lies into two major standards. The fact that we all wish for hapiness and a calm life, and the philosophic notion that this happiness and this ability to see the wonder in things is already inside of us. You just need to find it.\\nBeing honest, I don\\'t really mind that Aria is little of a underrated series. If it\\'s like this, the amount of haters are minimal, there\\'s no controversy around it, neither people arguing to see \"which is the best character\". The way it is, Aria will continue to be slowly recommended from friends to friends, just like in the pace of the anime itself.\\nAs for enjoyment, it sure hits the maximum score. Without any action scene or a suddenly twists in the plot, Aria still managed to amuse me every single episode. There\\'s no way I would watch one episode and don\\'t feel refreshed, all warm and fuzzy inside. Meaning-of-life anime? This is definitely one.\\nI probably went full-philosophic in the last paragraphs, then for a closure to this review, a funny observation:\\nAria is not perfect. There\\'s something pretty annoying on it, that will chase you from the 1st episode to the last of the 3rd season (...) 99% of the characters\\' names and/or last names starts with \"A\". Aqua, Aria, Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Akira, Athena, Ai, Al, Anna, Akatsuki...\\nIt\\'s pretty hard to memorize who is who before you get used to them!\\nI hope I was able to introduce at least a little bit of this great story that is Aria.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Is Aria a good series? Probably. Does it deserve to be held up as a masterpiece? I doubt it.\\nAria tends to be hyped up as *the* epitome of slice-of-life, so I expected an anime with all the strong points of the genre, including fleshed-out, relatable characters. Aria fails in that respect, and that compromises the amount of enjoyment I can derive from this series as a slice-of-life fan who has no specific interest in cute girls doing cute things.\\nWhat I object to isn\\'t the fact that the cast is female-dominated, though more gender balance would have been nice. [The first half of Haibane Renmei,\\nfor instance, is an example of an anime with a mostly-female cast that rises above the \"cute girls do cute things\" formula, and manages to have some characters (not all, admittedly) with depth.] What I object to is the use of generic character traits and catchphrases as a substitute for actual characterisation. There\\'s the sweet ditzy one, the feisty one, the -_- one, the sweet onee-san type... The characters are generally likeable - they\\'re just not very interesting.\\nMy other main issue with Aria is that it is heavy-handed and mawkish. Other iyashikei series like Natsume Yuujinchou and YKK manage to be heartwarming without being horribly unsubtle, and have variations in mood and tone as well. For most of the series, Aria\\'s mood setting is stuck on \"painfully sweet\". Conflicts are always easily resolved, and the characters cheerfully spout trite platitudes for at least half of each episode. The first time we get an episode with any sense of wistfulness or melancholy is episode 11, and that\\'s far too late in the series.\\n(President Aria also came across as annoying rather than cute, partly due to the irritating noises that he made.)\\nAs for technical issues: For the most part, Aria manages to look beautiful despite having occasionally clunky animation and slightly jarring CGI. This is partly because its backgrounds are largely copies of actual Venice (only a lot less crowded with tourists, lol), but there\\'s some great art direction as well.\\nThe music is pleasant and well-suited to the gentle tone of the anime, but not outstanding. If you have a low tolerance for cutesy, unrealistic voice acting, this isn\\'t the best series for you.\\nIf you\\'re happy watching a sweet and fluffy iyashikei series, this will suit you fine; but if you prefer something that has depth, is nuanced, and has a gently melancholic mood, you\\'re not going to find those elements in Aria.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '40f8cc99d21663cbffe27e65e41c0790'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Slice of life anime are difficult to represent to audiences in an entertaining manner without being a boring spectacle; that\\'s why most of these have dramatic or romantic elements, or a lot of fanservice in them in order to be appealing to the viewer. But then there is Aria: The Animation, a slice of life in its purest form, that proves that such type of anime doesn\\'t need any of the above to be succesful. Having dived in without any expectations whatsoever, I was pleasantly surprised: it was proven how wonderful and relaxing such a simple anime can be.\\n~Story~\\nThe premise of Aria: The Animation is\\nof simple nature: Akari Mizunashi, a teenager who moved from Manhome to the planet Aqua (formerly known as Mars), joins the Aria Company to become a professional Undine - or a professional tour guide - in Neo Venezia, a flawless presentation of Venezia itself. This may seem as something totally uninteresting, learning how to become a undine, yet while it certainly is an aspect of importance, its main focus lies in the interactions with the people in the city, in addition to world building of the location.\\nAnother interesting aspect is the fact that it is a planet covered in water and while it gives the impression at first of being a simplistic and somewhat regressed humanity technologically wise, it is for the matter not: it is mixed with futuristic vehicles and devices such as gigantic airships, or flying machinery, whereas everyday tools are simple, which gives the viewer a feeling of attachment to the setting itself, as this may be something that would happen in the near future. Now it must be said that not much of the world and how it came to be is revealed, which will maybe be done in the sequels.\\nAs mentioned earlier, the story focuses on the different interactions with the people of Neo Venezia, and naturally fellow apprentice undines, as well as professional ones. It doesn\\'t stop there: world building is done through the different, but intricate people of the city necessary to maintain a working society. Audiences may think that this anime has the approach of \"cute girls doing cute things\", yet with Aria it doesn\\'t give this impression at all: they\\'re just humans living their everyday life. These interactions are truly fascinating and heartwarming to watch, as it is in addition very relaxing as it also represents the ups and down life has.\\n~Characters~\\nThe cast of characters in Aria: The Animation is not big, and is by no means necessary; in fact, it fits well with the story to have a better and more realistic fleshing out of a handful of characters, than to have an excess of those. It must be mentioned that the fleshing out is limited and nothing outstanding, as well as character development itself. The characters are simple and have distinct personalities, that fits well with the setting and different relationships between the characters.\\nWhat however stands out in Aria are the character interactions: these are very well presented, in a realistic and soothing manner. These are heartwarming and varied, nothing overly dramatic, which relay simple messages as enjoyment of the simple things of life, or realization of your own flaws through your environment and relationships with the characters. Which leads to other great aspect of the anime: the females are in no way sexualized, which is a huge plus to the anime.\\nOther aspect that was really soothing and amusing to watch were said interactions: these were often witty and funny that managed to make me smile, and sometimes even blurt out quite often, which was something unexpected. These can be in addition quite emotional as well, as viewers observe how some of the characters are affected by their environment. What also struck me was the fact that the anime didn\\'t seem to focus on Akari, rather her friends and companions as well.\\n~Animation and sound~\\nThe animation of Aria: The Animation (ha, animation) was well done, character movements being fluid, at times even being surprisingly well done. The art style itself is average, but fulfills its purpose well, having distinct character design and well drawn backgrounds that represented well the world and atmosphere the anime was trying to convey to the viewer. Another bonus is the smooth transition between the introduction and opening of the show, as well as the ending: it never felt an abrupt change.\\nWhat however really stands out is the soundtrack used: besides the wonderful opening and ending songs that matched well with the story, were the individual OST\\'s used. These were particularly of high quality to what the show was trying to convey, in addition to not being overused throughout the show. The voice actors performed their role well, matching well with the personalities of the characters and was relaxing to listen at.\\n~Enjoyment~\\nWhat I initially thought to be a boring show about Venezia and how to become a undine, proved to be so much more interesting and relaxing than ever expected. The narrative and interactions with the characters, the humor and wonderful OST did a fantastic job to have a wonderful experience. The fact that it was no \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of show, in addition to females not being sexualized in any manner, was a huge bonus to the show. It certainly lacked in character development and having any type of story which I usually am no fan of, however the story set out what it meant to do.\\nSome may wonder why I only gave it a score of only 8 despite all the positive things I mentioned in the review: this is mainly because nothing really happens, it is purely oriented on slice of life with no goal apparent. World building was a bit lackluster as well. I could recommend to anyone with an interest in the slice of life genre, just don\\'t expect anything groundbreaking.\\nThank you for reading.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bf21a3a01e78b6a9a1f58cfd2dabcb05'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Aria the Animation is not an anime for everybody. It\\'s perceived as boring to many people, which is understandable. There is little action here and the plot is somewhat slow and aimless. There\\'s also little moe compared to other slice-of-life anime. I should also mention as this IS set in a utopian society, there won’t be nearly as many sad emotions as happy ones, so those looking for a realistic anime should also not expect to find it here; Aria is blissful if nothing else. However, if you are in the mood to watch something relaxing and heartwarming, Aria the Animation would be a perfect\\nchoice.\\nThe setting takes place in the Utopian society of Neo Venezia, in the planet of Aqua, a terraformed planet filled with water. Though it does take place in the future and is classified as “sci-fi,” Neo-Venezia often feels like more of a past, halycon world. It centers on Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they set out on their journey in becoming prima-undines, the greatest undines (or tour guides) in the region.\\nThe overall plot is not linear though trio do have a goal in mind (becoming prima-undines), it is not the prime focus of the anime. Rather, each episode is its own adventure, and by this I do not mean the kind of adventure like a hero’s quest to slay the evil dragon.  Instead, it is the adventure of Akari discovering the wonders of Neo-Venezia that are yet to be found. She meets new friends and experiences the many joys of friendship and the love of those close to her. Through its loveable characters and serene and idyllic environment, Aria the Animation manages to transform things usually mundane and perfunctory into something heartwarming and beautiful. Each episode leaves behind a warm, fuzzy (and inexplicable) feeling in your heart. Some also leave a hint of sadness as the trio realize that their lives currently filled with euphoria will not last forever.\\nThe characters in Aria the Animation are all likeable and fit perfectly in the anime, adding to its lovely atmosphere.  All the characters start their name with “A,” though I’m not entirely sure why. Though the characters are likeable, they lack relative depth (and little character development) and stick to their portrayed characters (to some people, to a repetitive extent). However, I feel as if this isn’t too bad of a thing, as Aria the Animation stands out for its simplicity and the characters add to that unique trait.\\nThe art in Aria the Animation was captivating, and was a considerable factor in what made Aria the Animation’s atmosphere so magnificent. The portrayals of the city and background were beautiful throughout. The amount of detail was consistently impressive, which is paramount to creating the impression that Neo-Venezia is a real place. In fact, the team in charge of creating Aria and its art traveled to Venice in order to create the most accurate depiction as possible; needless to say, they succeeded. Though there were some chibis here and there, the characters were generally nicely designed. And praise the lord, no moe in sight.\\nA little downside to Aria’s art is that it’s not in high definition (at least not yet, perhaps the Blu-Ray will change that). And while this lack of video quality is limiting, it never prevents Aria from creating the vivid landscapes and magnificent spectacles that Aria is well known for.\\nThe soundtrack was amazing as well, and it blends well with the anime. The background music added to certain scenes helped maximize its effect to the fullest extent, and each piece of the OST was aesthetically astounding. The sound is one of the most astounding parts of the anime, and are of utmost importance in creating its atmosphere. The OP and ED were just some of the amazing songs, and after finishing Aria the Animation I would recommend checking out the rest of the album as well. “Rainbow,” in particular, is one of my favorite songs I have ever encountered in any anime.\\nThe setting of Neo-Venezia itself plays a fundamental role in Aria. As previously mentioned, the detail of the surrounding environment bring life to the picture, and the decoration of buildings and scenery in the background bring Neo-Venezia a sense of place. One of Akari’s greatest joys is learning more about the wonders of Neo-Venezia. As the audience, we follow her in her quest of knowledge, as we visit new places and meet new people throughout the episodes, we begin putting together the picture of Neo-Venezia. By the end of the trilogy, Neo-Venezia is nothing short of a fully fleshed-out world, leaving behind a certain touch of sadness as we experience the dreamy world one last time.\\nAbove all else, it is through its atmosphere that Aria works its magic. The result of a perfect combination of the plot, the setting, and the audiovisuals, the atmosphere of Aria makes it what it is. Aria is almost always cheerful and uplifting, warming the heart to its very core. Yet it is also calm and relaxing, evoking a sense of tranquility. This atmosphere is the inner core of Aria, but it is also what makes it a hit or miss series. You really have to “feel” the atmosphere of Aria to enjoy it, and as this is the case, Aria often comes off as soporific to those who don\\'t feel the same.\\nAria the Animation was an amazing anime, and I greatly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those who enjoyed Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou or any slice of life fanatic. With its lovely character crew, stunning audiovisuals, and blissful and relaxed atmosphere, Aria the Animation gives you a feeling of contentment and tranquility.\\nAs I said before, don\\'t expect to be at the edge of your seat in every episode, because you won\\'t be. Rather, sit back and relax, as you slowly drift into the world of Neo-Venezia...\\nI decided to end this review with a song that, while trite, I felt encapsulated Aria:\\n\"Row, row, row your boat,\\ngently down the stream.\\nMerrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,\\nlife is but a dream!\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4d7c7b767b5b0d553a47936bde66dcfc'}>,\n",

Still, it was a little too slow sometimes.\\nAnimation\\nOverall I thought it was good. Nice colours, and good character designs. And the many shots of Aqua were nice. But I still got a feeling it wasn't perfect. I guess it could have been more detailed, specially the people and their faces. But it\\nwas pleasant still.\\nSound\\nThis is just great, there is some soothing background music nearly all the time, and it gets you really relaxed. The opening and ending themes are also nice songs, that I never skipped. There are also a lot of insert songs, and when the undine Athena sings, it's just lovely. The voiceactors are great too.\\nCharacter\\nI liked the characters. No doubt about it. The undines were especially great, they were so diverse, and not to forget; funny. My favourite is Akari, the heroine, there are so many things about her that are memorable, and how she behaves with the other undines is hilarious. Aika and Alice are really funny as well, and the three fairies. I must say that the sidecharacters are good too, heck even the cats, even though I found them a bit irritating at first.\\nEnjoyment\\nDue to the show's slow pace, it took some time for me to get into it. But when I did, I liked it a lot. It's really relaxing to watch, with no action or drama, and such.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'The past has always been a concept of fascination and longing, sometimes even to the point of obsession. One only has to read Scot Fitzgerald\\'s \"The Great Gatsby\" or J.D. Salinger\\'s \"The catcher in the Rye\" to see wonderful examples of stories and characters obsessed with time and living in the ostensibly golden world of the past. Humans are very guilty of this crime, we constantly refer to the good old days, we flock to ruins and ancient cities as we believe them to have an almost magical quality, we invariably ignore the words of George Orwell who once said \"contrary to popular belief the\\npast was not more eventful than the present\". It would seem to me that this love of the past is as ubiquitous as love itself, and so it should come as no surprise to find it alive and well in the anime world…\\nAria may be a series set centuries in the future, but its heart is very much in the past, be it in its setting, its customs, its outlook or its characters. But before we get into that, a quick summary of the show.\\nAria the Animation is the first season of the highly acclaimed Aria series, the setting is a terraformed mars, renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water. Here mankind has settled into a quieter existence, more reminiscent of the early 19th century than one would expect of a space colony. The main city is Neo-Venezia, a complete reconstruction of the ancient city of Venice, it is here that our main character, Akari Mizunashi, arrives to fulfil her dream of becoming an Undine (female gondolier). She soon falls in the love with the city, its people and their quiet way of life…\\nFrom this point on the show for the most part drops its sci-fi shawl and becomes much more fantastical and archaic, to the point that it becomes easy to forget that your on mars or even watching a sci-fi show at all. Instead a slow but steady atmosphere is built up and a tangible world appears before your eyes, it becomes not a story but an experience, and a truly unique and beautiful one at that.\\nUpon hearing this synopsis it would be perfectly within reason to assume this series will be nothing more than a lighthearted fluffy sci-fi show with some hippy free spirited tendencies, nothing could be further from the truth.\\nI take issue with people who label, or worse, accuse this series of being \"just episodic\", granted the series can indeed give this impression and the record of the episodic genre is not a particularly clean one, but there are many things that set this series apart from that taboo genre. One is the excellent characters which help to tie everything together while conveying the feeling that your watching real people living their lives and not just acting out a plot or random adventures. And the other is the recurring themes present in the series, in particular the theme of the past and of manmade miracles...\\nWith it slow pace, longing for the past and love of beauty, Aria manages to convey a feeling thats hard to describe, but is best summed up with the face you make while watching it, a sort of sad smile, a sardonic grin, a longing to be there but a desire to be distant, to keep from tainting its peace and beauty. From its canals and streets flooded with moonlight, its rustic buildings, the different Undine companies and traditions to the simple mailman, a world is quickly built up that soaks you in its cooling imaginative water. The show itself becomes a celebration of mankind and it ability to create beauty, but also destroy (more later). I mentioned earlier the theme of manmade miracles, this idea that man can create wondrously beautiful things if he really wants to  is extremely prevalent, after all the whole planet is essentially of human construct, the cities, the air, the water, the atmosphere, the temperature is all man and woman made. A point the show is constantly reminding us of, \"No Gods or Kings only man\" seems an extremely fitting quote to apply to this spirt, here mankind and individuals came together to create something incredibly beautiful with the result being that people\\'s feelings and desires have actually allowed for an atmosphere where more conventional miracles can occur.\\nThis atmosphere is unique among anime, or any series I know of for that matter, few come close to achieving its healing and peaceful aurora, only certain episodes of Natsume Yanijico or the manga Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou can touch it.  But do not get the wrong impression of what i mean, this is no frosted cake of sugary sweetness, superficially perhaps, but under it all there is a distinct bitter after taste, oh its subtle all right but make no mistake its there. From Akari\\'s occasional references to the state of Manhome (a.k.a Earth, I know its a stupid name) and how \"you can\\'t swim in the sea\\'s of Manhome anymore\" give earth a distinct dystopian feeling, and her fascination with all the simple wonders of utopian Neo-Venezia make one wonder just what her childhood was really like back on earth, which seems to have been all but ruined by man and woman. On top of that we have episodes dealing with letters to dead men, journeys to the past and worrying about the future. Again seeing this fascination with the past tinged with sombre nostalgia which sees to permeate throughout the whole show, creating this mix of feelings, happiness tinged with remorse, joy mixed with regret, jocoseness juxtapositional with a realisation that this bliss cannot last forever...\\nBut enough with themes, on to the shows central pillar upon which everything else is able to rest comfortably, the characters. And do not let first impressions sway you to believe that they are going to be moe fools splashing water on each other as the picture M.A.L has chosen to encapsulate the series would seem to suggest...\\nInstead the characters, like the show are quite subdued and not in any rush to explain to the viewer who they are. One must also take into account that this is only the first season, and the real character development doesn\\'t come until really the late second and third seasons, all the more aesthetically so for it, but here the ground work is set for the future masterpiece, every great work of art had to begin with a few basic sketches, a few simple outlines and in a similar way that is what is happening here. At first it may appear a bit jarring and one dimensional to see Akari\\'s simple minded fascination with everything and her close friend  Aika\\'s constant scolding of her wonder and \"embarrassing remarks\" or to see Alicia\\'s (her senior) ever-present smile and gracefulness, but before long they become like reassuring kisses to your soul. Besides the show quickly makes it clear that these people are far deeper than a quick glance would suppose. I have already alluded to Akari\\'s past and the possible reasons for her fascination and wonder at Neo-Venzia but there is also Aika and her struggles with her confidence and Alice their other undine friend who struggles with the stigma of being a child prodigy.\\nBut one thing all of the three main girls Akari, Aika and Alice have in common, besides their frustratingly similar names, its that they each have a senior who mirrors them in some shape or form, the original three \"water fairies\" as they are known, who guides them in their own unique way and whose friendships and past is similar, reminding one of what Mark Twain once remarked, \"History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme\"...\\nTo talk about the visuals and the music of this series is to do it a disservice, not only are the visuals stunning and the music divinely/hauntingly unforgettable, but everything fits so well with the atmosphere that you\\'d hardly even notice that music is playing or animation happening. I hate to beat a tired drum but i must stress that this atmosphere, is the show, this strange mix of feelings and wondrous healing aurora is only possible thanks to the perfect tone setting music, while portraying the themes of the series so vividly is only possible thanks to the exceptional art, showing us this man made miracle, this rusty but alive city… Speaking of the city, you might be wondering why even bother to set this series on Mars if your just going to have a quiet little character driven series with little to no sci-fi. Well I suspect that the extravagant setting was to allow for two things, more creative freedom without the constraints of being set in a factual Venice, and to allow the introduction of certain characters and idea\\'s such as Akatsuki Izumo a character who lives high above Neo-Venezia in a floating city and works to control the temperature to make it habitual for humans, all in all it was a paramount decision that helped to create a masterpiece.\\nTo culminate, as with the past itself, Aria only gets better with age. Like some great golden tower it seems to rise out of its genre and set the bar for all utopian works. Making no attempt to disguise what it is or be what its not it sets its own pace and like a gentle breeze we are carried along with it. The challenges its characters face are not of a life threatening disposition and all the better for it, its love of the past and of man-made miracles provide a look into something we all feel but rarely discuss or think about. Like the beating of the tide against the buildings of venice or the rhythms of a poem, Aria seems to subtly ebb and flow between joy and sadness, future and past, the miracles of man and moments of magic, without ever losing focus of its characters or their hopes and feelings. And while Animation may be the weakest of the three seasons, it is only so because it must be, all that would eventually become a masterpiece is set-up here and the foundations of greatness firmly laid upon which its tower is built.\\nLike the golden past we long for so much, Aria the animation isn\\'t perfect, but it does open the door to future seasons, which damn well come pretty close…', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '53cc26b3edf5fc0eae383e7d07c1694f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Aria is often seen as the essential anime within the iyashikei sub-genre, which falls under Slice of Life umbrella. Before we talk about iyashikei or \"healing\" anime, we have to define Slice of Life.\\nFirstly, the genre tag Slice of Life gets used way too often here on MAL. Both School Rumble and Kino\\'s Journey are tagged this way, despite being fundamentally different shows on nearly every level. On MAL, Slice of Life is used to refer to virtually any series that\\'s not heavily plot oriented and doesn\\'t feature tons of blood and boobs. School Rumble is a slapstick romantic comedy whereas Kino is a\\npsychological/philosophical series. A slightly more concrete definition would be \"A naturalistic depiction of people going through a mundane period of real, everyday life\". While half the anime considered Slice of Life here are inappropriately labeled, Aria is a true Slice of Life anime.\\nWhile the term \"Slice of Life\" is borrowed from the French language and many countries write these kind of plays, Iyashikei is more distinctly Japanese. An iyashikei is an anime or manga that not only lacks a central conflict, but all internal conflict as well. It\\'s a series where everything is happy all the time and it feels like eating a bowl of cotton candy for dinner. For a Western audience, this seems like \"Care Bears\" kind of shit. Stories for adults and older teens are simply NOT written this way. Why does this shit exist in Japan? The answer is stress. Japan is not only one of the hardest working countries in the world in terms of number of hours, but also has extremely strict expectations. Japanese students from the time they\\'re children go to school 6 days a week and study on average 4-5 times as much as American students. In Japan there is common phenomenon called \"kuroshi\" or death by overwork. It\\'s also a country with historically one of the highest suicide rates in the world. In such a brutally difficult environment, iyashikei is a means of temporary escapism. You spend 30 minutes to an hour watching a show like Aria and your level of stress and depression is lowered enough to get back to work or studying.\\nBy describing iyashikei, I\\'ve already described a lot about Aria. The characters don\\'t suffer from any psychological issues and don\\'t need to go on a character journey of redemption or improvement. There is never an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Even Seinfeld has more conflict than Aria. Problem: George, Kramer, Elaine, and Jerry are in a parking garage and can\\'t find their car. Elaine needs to get to the car quickly in order for her newly purchased pet goldfish to survive. George has a meeting with his overbearing parents, who will scream at him if he\\'s late. There are stakes and consequences if the gang can\\'t find their car in time. Aria is a pure utopia where there are ZERO stakes. Akari from Aria is absolutely perfect at her job, but if she wasn\\'t it wouldn\\'t matter.\\nThe plot of Aria can be summed up in a few sentences. It\\'s the distant future and technology has solved basically all our problems. We can terraform other planets, overpopulation isn\\'t an issue, war is a thing of the distant past, etc. Mars has become a tourism planet renamed \"Aqua\" that contains replicas of many of Earth\\'s most scenic cities. Our story takes place in Neo-Venice and follows the lives of 3 girls who\\'re training to row gondola boats and become tour guides. Each of the 3 young girls has a rowing master who trains them and lives with them. Gradually, the girls learn to become ever better tour guides and that\\'s essentially the entire plot for all 3 seasons of Aria!\\nSo what makes Aria good? It\\'s all about the details. Aria has a really soothing and beautiful atmosphere that\\'s paired together perfectly with a relaxing soundtrack. Every single episode has at least 1 moving speech. Often it\\'s about happiness or the nature of beauty or something along those lines. Aria is a very sentimental series and I mean that in a good way. While Aria was created specifically to soothe Japanese stress, it has found a large audience outside of Japan. Other countries also have stress and depression, so Aria can give a little relief to these people as well. As of 2019, America\\'s suicide rate managed to finally catch up to Japan\\'s. Keep in mind that Catholic, Hispanic Americans are lowering America\\'s numbers. The suicide rate of Non-Hispanic Whites here in America has already surpassed the Japanese average by a significant margin. Maybe America needs less partisan news media and more Aria.\\nI\\'ll end by saying that Aria isn\\'t necessarily a series for everyone. I\\'ve met a LOT of resistance from my offline buddies, who all seem to think it\\'s boring as fuck. I can certainly see why they would think that and I don\\'t mind when that\\'s how people react to it. However, if you\\'re feeling really depressed or stressed out and you want to watching something pleasant and peaceful, Aria is there for you!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '68fb525d10f2fd4bd5d055b4234fd705'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\\nThere\\'s a lot that goes on in a day-to-day basis that can easily elevate stress levels. Rushing to work due to oversleeping or caring for a crying child bring about more trouble than was initially had. Eventually, these separate events can pile together to the point of breaking. It\\'s at this time that a reprieve is needed. A much-earned break, that brings simple serenity and peace of mind. And it\\'s during this mellow moment that one discovers that the simple things in life are truly precious. Aria the Animation takes this to heart, marking the start of a\\nrather laid-back journey.\\nSTORY\\nAria the Animation essentially follows Akari, a young woman working for the Aria Company, a tour-by-gondola establishment. Alongside her best friends Aika and Alice, they meet many different people as they aspire to be \"Prima Undines.\"\\nIf there is a word that best describes the show, the first one to come to mind is \"calm.\" Above anything else, Aria exudes a blissful feeling that washes over the audience like the waters they ride upon. Its ability to achieve such an effect is done mostly by the way in which it portrays itself. Aria first and foremost makes it its mission to avoid conflict or high-pressure situations. The \"action\" taking place never goes beyond leaves blowing in the wind; at most, riding an air-bike and paddling backwards are the extent of the \"dangers\" that take place. The norm is much quieter: a small conversation by the fire with cocoa, a nighttime look at the shining stars, and basking in the warmth of the sun at the beach are poignant scenarios that demonstrate exactly what makes Aria so peaceful.\\nBut it\\'s also more than just the scenes themselves. Each episode follows a simple format: a small talk in the beginning to present its theme, providing the evidence to support it, and finally a few words tying it all together. The majority of the themes tackled are general, and therefore apply to most people. Ideas such as taking a step back to look at a situation from a different perspective or learning to see the silver-lining are applicable to anyone. Now, the themes are not particularly powerful; not only is there a constant turnover but also, due to their overall generality, it makes many of them rather cliché. The execution is there -- due mostly to the calm atmosphere and basic approach -- but it\\'s missing endearment or everlasting impact.\\nMost slice-of-life shows end there, but Aria twists the formula slightly. Typically, this genre of anime requires a strong cast due to a weaker narrative, and therefore much of the focus is placed on the characters. However, here, it does the opposite; the world, Aqua, is what matters most. Akari and the girls, being Neo-Venezia tour guides, are tasked with explaining the setting to the tourists aboard their gondolas. But what\\'s interesting is that it\\'s not just the tourists gaining knowledge, but the viewer is, too. In essence, the watcher is getting the same experience as the people who paid for the trip. This sounds straightforward: they\\'re all guides, so it\\'s normal for them to describe Aqua out loud. And it is, but that is the beauty of this simplicity. Learning about the Salamanders who work in Ukijima that keep track of water and temperature levels, witnessing the different Undine companies, and understanding the Gnomes who are responsible for regulating the gravity of the planet comes off as completely natural because it\\'s both the girls\\' livelihood and forte. While the world-building isn\\'t always done \"on the job,\" it\\'s delivered in a concise manner; a figurative gondola ride.\\nANIMATION\\nThe art for Aria the Animation is nicely done, but it seems to be missing the second part of its title.\\nPutting Aqua at the forefront once more, the art style puts a lot of attention towards what Neo-Venezia and the surrounding area has to offer. Rustic bridges, multi-windowed houses, outside cafes, prominent statues, and narrow canals really do make it look and feel like the Venice it envisioned. At the same time, the colors and lighting are very soft, adding once more to the calmness of the package. And when the anime is looking to inject some comedy here and there, the girls adopt different faces -- Akari\\'s becomes rectangular-like, Aika\\'s becomes cat-like, and Alice\\'s becomes fish-like -- to good effect.\\nThe character designs are actually rather interesting. Besides just the varying hair styles and colors, of important note are the Undines\\' attire. Consisting of a white cap and gown, laced with the color of the company they represent, the outfit is both futuristic and classic. Alongside them are the goggled, jacketed Woody, the formal Akatsuki, and the short yet cloaked Al, each of whom fit the look of their respective roles nicely.\\nActual animation is usually about average, when it is present. The problem lies in the aforementioned refusal to do anything even remotely with their bodies. A lot of talking and sitting is had, meaning most of the animation is comprised of moving mouths or shifting positions slightly, with the occasional over-exaggeration. On top of this, the camera purposefully provides more scenic views of Aqua to accomplish two tasks at once: less actual animation and more environment viewing.\\nCHARACTERS\\nThe cast of Aria the Animation play their parts, but not much more.\\nAlice is a young girl who works for the Orange Company. Initially isolated due to her lack of empathy, she learns the value of friendship through Akari\\'s way of dealing with others and their predicaments. In other words, Alice begins to go \"more with the flow,\" enjoying what life has to offer now; she sees that that is a much more rewarding way to live. Extremely talented in the art of gondola controlling, she becomes a pseudo-rival to Aika, motivating each other to perform better during training. Above all, while she rarely speaks, she isn\\'t afraid to speak her mind, letting others know precisely how she is feeling should she be pushed to do so.\\nAs the \"head\" of the Himeya family, and subsequently working for Himeya Company, Aika is a proud and determined Single. Her best friend is Akari, and from this relationship sprouts her most famous phrase: \"No sappy lines allowed!\" Idolizing Alicia but loathing Akira, Aika comes to understand two vital lessons. One, that people are complex; just because someone acts a certain way doesn\\'t mean that the extent of their person has been discovered. And two, life isn\\'t always about working or training; everybody deserves to have fun from time to time.\\nRounding out the up-and-coming Primas is Akari. With her unending happiness, affable personality, and beautiful optimism, she exemplifies kindness in all of its forms. Working for the Aria Company, she cares for the President of the same name while receiving wisdom from Alicia. As the lead, she experiences every motif firsthand. Cherishing memories, believing in miracles, and providing help; each message given throughout the anime fits wonderfully with Akari\\'s softhearted ideologies. Interestingly, Akari literally goes into the past in three, separate instances. The clue for why this occurs is found in the third, when Ai -- her Manhome friend and messaging buddy -- also goes with her. And it is love. Not love for the people she doesn\\'t know, not love for her closest companions, but love for Aqua itself. Above anyone else, Akari understands what the world is and what it can offer. In short, Akari knows that it\\'s love that makes a difference.\\nAs a final note, there is an intriguing comparison to be made between the trainee and master pairs. When looking closely, there exists a similar yet dichotomous relationship for each individual coupling. Athena and Alice are both prodigies, but the former is known for her singing while the latter is known for her rowing. Akira has a harsh outer shell but is soft on the inside, as opposed to Aika\\'s outwardly composed yet inwardly critical self. And Alicia listens while rarely speaking, but Akari can always be heard providing some poetic line. The young women have the Three Great Water Fairies teaching them because they complement what each lacks: confidence, balance, and patience, respectively. While their influence has yet to fully latch on, the purpose for their connection has not.\\nSOUND\\nThe OP is a rather beautiful song. It starts with gentle singing, and is followed by the tapping of drums and soft violin. The vocalist is given the opportunity to demonstrate some prowess through nice vocal range, providing the audience with the \"winding down\" that is needed to watch the show.\\nThe ED is a strange step down. In comparison, it is rather lame but can still be quite catchy. The fun guitar, more plain vocals, and background singers give the whole piece a tame feeling that fits the show but doesn\\'t have the same power as its counterpart.\\nThe soundtrack, like the events and art alongside it, further adds to the soothing feel of the show. Guitar-playing, simple piano pieces, whistling tunes, and caring violins are interspersed throughout the entire experience. Everything is quite slow, following the crawling of the story itself. However, at certain points, there are played more lyrical-heavy tracks that detract from the anime and its overall goal of keeping easygoing.\\nAs for voice acting, the performances involved are mostly above-average. Eri Kawai, as the singer for Athena, was always captivating to hear. Erino Hazuki as Akari for her kind way of speaking, Sayaka Ohara as Alicia for her motherly inflection, and Chinami Nishimura as President Aria for her unintelligible but cute sounds; each deserves a special shout-out.\\nENJOYMENT\\nWhile watching the show, it really did give me that sense of being \"chill.\" That the happenings going on to Akari and the gang were so regular and sweet that it became quite difficult not to be at ease. Unfortunately, some of the moments were unemotional when they should have been -- Akari delivering Ami\\'s letter and Akari seeing her snowbug friend off at the start of winter are some that come to mind.\\nMany of the segments are not particularly engaging, but it can be quite humorous when it wants to be. Akari\\'s usual \"Ehh?\" replies after being scolded by Aika, Athena\\'s clumsiness, and Alicia\\'s constant use of, \"My, my\" are repetitive, but were usually able to make me smile. And this goes for every character; they have their shtick that is used quite frequently yet never really feels overdone.\\nHeading in the right direction, Aria the Animation, for the most part, accomplished what it wanted to begin. It\\'s calming, it\\'s funny at times, and most of all it\\'s simple. While the characters are weak and both sound-work and animation could see some improvement, the story and art help to alleviate some of the issues. All that being said, I\\'m very much looking forward to seeing what Akari, Aika, and Alice will be showing me next in the city of Neo-Venezia.\\nSUMMARY\\nStory: Good, master of calm, general and forgetful themes, figurative gondola ride\\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, interesting character designs, about average actual animation\\nCharacters: Fine, play their parts while holding mirrored relationships\\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\nEnjoyment: Fine, relaxing, somewhat funny, with low emotional investment\\nFinal Score: 5/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5b4433708df1f52ed44f28c03cd2b883'}>,\n",

The series received an anime adaptation in 2005, second anime adaptation in 2006, an OVA released in 2007, and a 3rd season in 2008. A new OVA, called Aria the Avvenire, was released in 2016.\\nAqua is a fictional planet that has many things to offer for its visitors. For example, the water city Neo Venezia. It is popular because of the city’s guides, who are called Undines, who are also professional gondoliers. Akari Mizunashi is a gondolier in training and also an employee of one of the companies in Neo Venezia, where you can book an excursion and your guide will be one of the famous Undines. Akari meets new people and unveils the secrets of Aqua.\\nWhat makes Aria that great is its simplicity. Not that it does not have a hidden meaning, or things for you to analyze, the series has a great number of episodes that are packed with many heartwarming and sometimes dramatic events. Aria is a masterpiece simply because of the fact that its main genre is SoL, but it is never boring to watch. Aria offers its viewer a fictional story that might as well become a reality in the future. For that very reason, it is that breathtaking to watch. As every SoL series, it has no action scenes, but what makes this series that amazing is its beauty. And Aria is amazingly beautiful: its world building, its characters; Aria is a series that every fan of the SoL genre has to experience.\\nAnimation wise, it is an open secret that the series aired long time ago and you might find the animation of the first season somewhat…lacking. But that should not worry you, since the 2nd, 3rd seasons, as well as the OVAs have a much better animation than in the 1st season.\\nSound wise, Aria has a great OST that is very relaxing to listen to. Not only the OST, but also the voice actors in Aria are top notch. Thanks to the voice actors, who did their best to show every emotion, the characters they voiced felt real, and because of that it was that enjoyable to watch Aria.\\nCharacter wise, the series has a wide range of characters: Akari, Alice, Aika, their senpais and other supporting characters. While they might look somewhat average at first, but the more you watch the series, the more you fall in love with Aria’s characters. What you might like about them, is the fact that they all are very different, yet similar. That is why it is never boring to watch the series.\\nEnjoyment wise and overall, Aria is, indeed, a title that might not attract the attention of many, it is still a breath of fresh air for many, Its uniqueness and amazing world-building, with an amazingly beautiful world of Aqua for the viewer to discover. Without a single doubt, Aria is a must see for all those, who enjoy and like the SoL genre.\\n10/10.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8a70da295f52129a2fda4fe63329a864'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'We all live in a very fast paced world.  To us humans, time is everything, and every second used is a second that can be used to be more \"productive\" or \"better\".  Because of this, we become creatures of habit, living cogs that let life fly by us without a moment\\'s thought.  We don\\'t really take time to enjoy the smaller things in life, to just sit down, relax, and take in the finer things that can go unnoticed.  It is here where we have Aria the Animation, a gem from 2005, and the beginning of the whole Aria series.\\nAuthor\\'s note:  If I write down any sappy lines, I\\'m sorry.  It\\'s just hard not to do that for this series.\\nStory (8.00/10): Aria the Animation takes place in the world known as Aqua, an alien planet settled and created by humans as a sort of \"second planet\" in order to satisfy the human population.  It is here on this newly created blue planet where we have Akari, our protagonist in this series, settle down on the new planet in a city named Neo-Venezia, a city built based on the city of Venice in Italy.  Here, she learns how to be a Prima Undine, a gondola driver, as she begins her life on this new and peaceful world.\\nThe story of Aria is a very simplistic story, focusing more on the day to day lives of the characters here on the planet of Aqua, mainly the lives of three specific girls, as they train themselves to be Prima Undine.  For any given episode, the characters in the series essentially live their lives on this planet, not really doing much else aside from dealing with the trials and tribulations that lives throw at us.\\nFrom the storyline of the series, it\\'s quite clear that Aria is not really a series that deals with conflicts as heavily as many series these days do.  The tone of the show is calming, serene, and overall, less dramatic than your average anime.  With the whole of its runtime, the show never tries to deviate from its relaxing tone.  As a result, the overall feel of the show is very unique because as you\\'re watching it, you never really get the sense that anything dramatic will happen.  Now, with zero conflicts, does that mean that this show is bad?  Quite the opposite in fact.\\nThe show tackles the smaller things in life.  Throughout the whole show, we are presented with scenes of the characters doing what people generally do in life.  Spend time with friends, doing chores, eating a meal, and even going on an outing; stuff that you would normally see in any given slice of life show.  However, Aria takes this idea one sep further.  Aside from just seeing that characters experience these moments in life, it also takes them into account, putting them in retrospect to one\\'s own life, affirming how we as people can miss the finer details, the smaller experiences that we sometimes fail to see.\\nIn addition to that, the show does a decent job at world building.  Rather than just letting the setting of a different world be just a stated fact, Aria the Animation adds in to that by spending a good chunk of its runtime explaining the world\\'s history, tying that into its life affirming story, making the two work in conjunction to make the story a lot more cohesive and adds to the experience.\\nWith all these good points, what is there to be said badly about this series?  Well, more or less, it\\'s the calming atmosphere that the story has.  Because this show is quite slow and doesn\\'t possess any lingering conflicts, Aria can at times be rather boring.  (I found this to be the case at times.)  It\\'s not that the show itself is bad, it\\'s just that watching something so slow can leave someone to be desiring a little bit more.  Of course, that\\'s not true for everyone, but personally, I couldn\\'t watch more than a couple episodes at a time simply because of how I sort of lost interest sometimes.\\nRegardless of that side effect of Aria\\'s wonderfully calming atmosphere, the story of Aria is still very exceptional.  It puts the things in life that we sometimes forget, forward, giving the audience a feeling of appreciation of things that we may often forget.\\nOverview:\\n+  Some World building\\n+  Very calming show\\n+  Fantastic themes\\n-   Calming factor can leave some people bored (To combat this, I suggest watching 2-3 episodes at one time rather than marathoning.)\\nCharacters (7.99/10): Similar to its story, Aria the Animation doesn\\'t have very complicated characters, each of which really following their own certain characteristics and never really deviating from the traits that they were given at time.\\nFirst we have Akari Muzunashi, the \"main protagonist\" of this series.  As the only apprentice in the Aria Company, Akari plays off as a very simple girl, wanting only to enjoy the time that she has on Aqua, frequently throwing out \"sappy lines\" in order to express her gratitude or overall enjoyment of the time that she spends with the people that she\\'s grown to know in her time in Aqua.  Akari also plays a very crucial role in this series by writing these letters at the end of every episode, essentially writing down any given episode\\'s important takeaway, bolstering the things that the episode is talking about.  It is because of this specifically that I think Aria excels at what it does, because the things that it talks about can really be an eye opener at times.\\nThen we have Aika Granzchesta, a Single from the Hime Company, a different gondola company that rivals the Aria Company.  Being the girl that is somewhat more outgoing than the other two, being very proud of her own abilities, Aika is the second girl in the series you meet with her classic line of \"No sappy lines\" (or any other variation of that phrase.)  In addition, to round out the trio of girls in this series, is Alice, a Pair from the Orange Planet company, (And no, she does not belong to a pest-control agency.)  acting as the youngest of the trio, working to hone her abilities as well as spending time with her senpais from the other companies.\\nApart from these main three girls in this series, we also have their instructors Alicia, Akira, and Athena, who serve similar roles to their apprentice counterparts, as well as the three feline company presidents.  In addition, there are side characters that appear every once in a while, filling in the gaps to make the series feel more populated and overall more enjoyable as you see the personalities of all the characters come together and just live life.\\nOverall, the characters themselves aren\\'t really that complicated.  Like general slice of life, the traits that they are given at the start of their appearances persist with them throughout the whole of the series, with slight growth every now and then to show progression.  Above all, what I think is most interesting is that these characters are very memorable.  They\\'re not very complicated, but even if they don\\'t show up for a while, the characters that you meet aren\\'t really that easily forgettable, which I find to be a plus for the series.\\nOverview:\\n+  Very simple characters that are easily memorable\\n+  Good character dynamics\\n+  Good side characters\\n-   Mostly one note characters in a sense\\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 8.78/10):  The art for Aria the Animation itself is honestly a surprise to me.  Because of its age (being that it\\'s a 2005 anime), I had originally thought that the artstyle wouldn\\'t stack up and would be less graphically well done as the anime that we see as of now.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was rather well animated.  T\\nThe artstyle reflects the feeling you get from the anime of serenity and calmness.  There are no horrendously bright colors, there isn\\'t any dark brooding colors, and there is certainly no ecchi.  Aria\\'s artsyle itself is very classic, being an individual looking style of animation that is bother memorable and very well made for its time.  (Like seriously.  I saw things in 2014 that looked worse than Aria.)  It\\'s a very simple style of animation with enough detail to make the city of Neo-Venezia look beautiful, and it just simply...works.\\nIn addition, for comedic feel, every one of the main characters has a \"second face\", where they all have a specific expression that they make whenever they want their audience to bust a funny.  (Just a detail that I found to be quite amusing.)\\nAs for the soundtrack, Aria boasts a very well made OST that reflects the feel of the series.  In addition to having \"Undine\" and \"Rainbow\" as the OP and ED respectively, the series has a very calming and beautifully crafted soundtrack that adds to the calm feeling of this series.  As for the OP and ED, Undine, its opening, is a very calm and serene peace that I bet can calm any spirit, sounding like flowing spring water as it wafts through your ears, cleansing you of any hardships that you may be experiencing.  As for Rainbow, its ED, it showcases a very cheerful and bouncy feel that is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.  Overall, this soundtrack is beautiful, a masterpiece that is timeless.\\nOverview:\\n+  Very good animation for its time period\\n+  Very classic looking artstyle\\n+  Exceptional soundtrack\\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.00/10): When I first heard about Aria the animation, I was always puzzled why it was so popular, and why it was so revered as a classic.  After some time, I decided to watch it, and boy, am I happy I did.  The themes of the series were very well delivered, and I couldn\\'t stop wearing a smile on my face when I was watching it.  (Above all, I listened to the OP and ED every time.  That doesn\\'t happen very often.)\\nDid I like this anime?\\nYes.  A very big yes.  Aria showcased something that anime for me has been lacking for a while; a simple story that is at the same time, very powerful.  Coupled with the beautiful soundtrack, the great animation, and some pretty memorable characters, there was hardly anything about this series that I didn\\'t enjoy.\\nWhat didn\\'t I like about this anime?\\nThe only thing I didn\\'t like was how at times, I admit, I felt kind of bored watching this series.  With its lack of conflict, Aria\\'s peaceful tone can sometimes be overwhelming.  As a result, marathoning this show can be difficult for some.  Apart from that, I have no complaints.\\nWould I recommend this anime?\\nAfter finally watching the legendary Aria the Animation, yes, I would recommend people to watch this series.  Contrary to anime today, there is no fanservice, it\\'s deep without needing any drama/melodrama, it\\'s a simple story that doesn\\'t poke itself into any other genre aside from Slice-of-life, and above all, it is considered to be a classic.  This show is an instant cheer-up, and to this day, is still a very revered series.  So, if you haven\\'t watched this series, I highly recommend you do.  It\\'s an experience that you won\\'t want to forget.\\nOverall Score:  8.35/10  (I\\'m sorry if there were any sappy lines.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Aria the Animation is the first of three anime series adapted from the Aria manga and focuses mainly on introducing the main characters - Akari, Aika and Alice - and the world of Aqua and Neo-Venezia, without going into much depth and while keeping an extremely relaxing and soothing atmosphere.\\nFor that reason the pacing of the first series can be a little off-putting to some viewers, as the new elements each episode adds are developed only to a limited scope (the introduction) and it might feel as though the whole series is nothing more than cute characters, chilly backgrounds, and relaxing BGM, especially to those\\nviewers who aren't used to the slice of life genre - The Animation is more about taking it easy than actually developing the characters.\\nTechnically, the animation is quite good for a slice of life show, and the amount of effort put by the creators can easily be seen in the backgrounds, water motion, coloring, and the detail of the buildings and scenery. The beautiful art, together with the soundtrack, which is the most memorable out of the three seasons, really creates atmosphere and attempts to draw the viewer in without much effort.\\nAria accomplishes the hard task of keeping characters simple while maintaining a degree of originality that allows them to always look fresh; the interactions between characters feel natural and both the comedy and dialogue are presented as though they are part of normal conversations, rather than a crafted script beforehand.\\nAlthough I enjoyed the series immensely and would highly recommend it, I must admit the series might not suit everyone's tastes, especially if the viewers are expecting realistic characters and situations because NOTHING is realistic in Aria.\\nThe utopian setting and the unrealistic character portrayal are instruments the series makes use to achieve its main goal: healing.

Only 1 obvious QUALITY\\nimage ever jumped out at me after the third rewatch and for the most part there were no flaws. Though it'd have been nice if the faces were drawn anywhere nearly as detailed as in the manga. But then that'd have to be budget-busting stuff.\\nProduction IG was roped in for the CG but it didn't seem all that impressive to me, though it certainly was enough to add to the atmosphere.\\nSOUND\\nAnd here, sir, is where this anime is made into the ideal therapeutic experience. Every single piece of music in every single scene is perfectly fitted together. The decision for Choro Club to cut a major album out of this meant the resulting music was absolutely, astoundingly brilliant. Coupled to the show, it was outstanding and perfectly fitting, while on its own it can be summed up as &quot;perfect&quot; (...that is, if you don't hate the Brazilian-style choro and the relaxing tune). The late Kawai Eri worked her magic into the very fitting OP that was soothing to the ears, while Round Table as usual put in a brilliant song for an ED. The insert song was pretty catchy too.\\nCHARACTER\\nHere unfortunately I'll have to put in some criticism. Most of the characters are simply not well-developed. We get to see the character of every, uh, character, but not much else. The sempai especially. There's almost no background story on them. Plus, they all seem so eerily close to perfect, it's unreal.\\nThat aside, Akari elevates herself to Goddess status as we see through her beautifully clear eyes the wonders of her world. And it is through her that the stories turn out so beautiful, so wonderful.\\nENJOYMENT\\nNeedless to say I loved this to bits. Every episode left me yearning for more wonderfulness, and I eventually wasted a whole day marathoning it when I should have been rushing for projects. It's guaranteed to lift your spirits, relieve whatever pressure you might of had, and turn any pessimist into a perenially happy optimist.\\nOVERALL\\nA beautiful slice-of-life anime all in all, and considering the popularity this had at its airing, way too under-watched.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Due to the nature of the show and my opinions on it, this will be split into different reviews. This is also the required order to watch Aria:\\nAria the Animation\\nAria the Natural\\nAria the Arietta\\nAria the Origination (and episode 5.5 and Picture Drama)\\nAria the Avvenire\\nWith that said, let\\'s begin!\\nOne kind of anime that I love is the calming and soothing kind, as you would no doubt be able to tell if you looked at my anime list. Shows like Mushishi and Girls Last Tour would fall\\ninto this category. They focus on worldbuilding and the characters themselves, while also having mesmerizing audiovisuals. This is why I wanted to try this series out, as the general reception of the show sung high praises of it for it\\'s cast and the unique setting that takes place in a terraformed Mars called Aqua. A world full of water and has many sci-fi elements in the background and houses Neo-Venezia, a city based off of Vence. The show focuses on three girls trying to become Prima Undines, which are tour guides that use gondolas to move around the city for customers. Our protagonist of this tale is Akari Mizunashi, who immigrated from Manhome (Also known as Earth), who moves to Neo-Venezia because she wants to become a Prima Undine herself. A cheerful and laid back girl who loves bringing joy to everyone she meets. Her mentor is Alicia, one of the three Great Water Fairies of the Prima Undines and is known for her calm and soothing personality. The show follows Akari and her adventures trying to become a Prima Undine while also exploring both the setting and the cast. So, let\\'s go through the seasons one by one!\\nSo, one thing that\\'s worth noting right away is that each season has a different feel and purpose to them. Aria the Animation introduces the world and the characters, Aria the Natural is expanding on the world and cast, and Aria the Origination is more so about giving the characters emotional closure to their arcs in a very satisfying way. Another general thing worth mentioning is that in order to become a Prima Undine, one would have to go through the three different stages. A pair, which is a beginner who wears two pairs of gloves. A single would wear one glove and a Prima Undine would wear no gloves. A pair and a single are not allowed to take customers on their own and have to be watched by their mentors. One thing I really like about the show is how the openings are used in the show. In any other anime, I can think of, the OPs and EDs are also accompanied by animation exclusive to that song. While this is true for Aria\\'s EDs, this isn\\'t true for the OPs, where the song is playing in the background while the characters are doing their daily activities. This is an amazing way to try and establish the general relaxed vibe that the show is going for, with the soft and composed singing also followed up with a sense of familiarity as the characters are established that this is how they go about their daily lives. The last general thing worth mentioning is that due to this season is more of an introduction, the first season is pretty aimless all things considered. It\\'s still a good season mind you, but it\\'s just not as strong as the latter two seasons. So, this section is more about explaining the general cast and setting as well as the other bits of the show, like animation and music.\\nFirst up, let\\'s talk more about Akari Mizunashi and her role as the main lead. Akari is a very optimistic girl who enjoys being with other people and loves the world of Aqua, calling it a place of miracles and loves to interact with other people in town. From her friends to Alicia, to total strangers, Akari will always help out others. Moving to Neo-Venenzia with the goal of becoming a Prima Undine, she certainly gives that sort of friendly tour guide vibe that would be needed for this kind of job. Under the tutorage of Alicia, she works in the Aria company (named after their cat, President Aria!). The Aria company is a small company, working with just those two and the mentor would eventually leave if the student becomes a Prima. Akari is a solid protagonist because I believe that she is a true embodiment of the main theme of the series: Appreciate the little things in life and enjoy your companions. Time doesn\\'t last forever, so you would be happier to enjoy the little stuff too. One thing that embodies this idea would be her emails to a friend that she meets in the first season and primarily lives in Manhome: Ai Aino\\nAi is an interesting kid. She came to visit Neo-Venenzia with a rather sour attitude due to the fact that her older sister went there with her husband and she kept raving about her time there. Ai ended up finding the place boring and tried to get Alicia to give her a tour. However, Alicia was busy as usual, so she ended up going around with Akari. Akari tries to deny her because she\\'s not allowed to take customers, but Ai gets her to do it by telling her she would yell things like kidnapper, and they would travel on the pretense of Ai being a friend, so Akari agrees. Traveling alongside Aika and Akari, Akari optimism changes Ai\\'s view on Aqua, and she warms up to the city of Neo-Venenzia. When she returns home, Akari and Ai would write emails to one another about how Akari is living in the city, and we would get a letter from Akari at the beginning of the episode and another from Akari at the end of an episode, which Ai\\'s letter ending the episode. It serves as a reflection piece of what the episode is about, and it really drives home the ideas and themes of the series. By the end of the show, what Ai does makes everything come full circle for both herself and Akari.\\nNext up would be Alicia Florence, the current head of the Aria company and one of the Great Water Fairies of the Prima Undines: Snow White. Being the youngest girl to become a Prima Undine at the age of 15. Succeeding the previous owner and founder of the company referred to as Grandma (Her name isn\\'t revealed until Origination), Alicia is popular due to her soothing voice and calming personality. She\\'s a very patient and peaceful woman, often praised for her grace and knowledge of Neo-Venenzia. Characters such as Aika and Akari look up to her and see her as a pillar of the Undines, but like anyone else, she\\'s a human being. She explains to Akari that she\\'s made mistakes and she tries to guide Akari to the point where she\\'s able to stand on her own. As a crutch, she\\'s able to be the gentle guiding hand of Akari and leads her to appreciate and discovering more of Neo-Venenzia. What also helps expand on her character would be flashbacks in both Animation and Natural where we explore her life with the other Water Fairies and how she became this respectable person she is today. Everything about her is serene and graceful, while still feeling human underneath that kind exterior.\\nAika S. Granzchesta is the daughter of the CEO of the Himeya company, and like Akari, she\\'s a single. The difference is that while they both have the same goal of becoming Prima Undine\\'s, Aika is also going to run a part of her own father\\'s company and eventually the entire company itself. The Aria company is much smaller by comparison, with only 2 people and a goofy cat to run it. Aika also idolizes Alicia and aspires to become like her. She believes that her mentor, Akira, is too strict on her and starts to feel annoyed with her. The show makes it clear that Aika does look up and cares for Akira as a mentor, but she wouldn\\'t openly admit that until later on in the show. Aside from a running gag about Akari saying a really charming or inspirational line and Aika saying \"No cheesy lines allowed!\" and Akari going \"Huh?\", one interesting thing about her is that she has trouble seeing what she\\'s good at compared to her friends. In many ways, she\\'s like Akira: Strict (Although perhaps not as much) and caring to the people so they can succeed. She\\'s a very outgoing and competitive individual, with her saying that she would become a Prima Undine faster than her two friends. She\\'s just a really fun and endearing character.\\nAkira E. Ferrari is the Crimson Rose and one of the three Water Fairies. She\\'s also Alicia\\'s childhood friend, and Alicia became a Prima Undine before she did. Just like her student, she is very competitive and also strict. Dishing out harsh criticism of the girls\\' performances regarding their skills. Compared to Alicia, she has a very different tutoring style. They will both guide you to the correct answer, but Alicia will gentle tell you what you did wrong while Akira will scold you if you messed up. She kind of reminds me of my own mom in some ways. A firm handed woman, but still a kind mother figure like Alicia. The other two seasons make this even more obvious.\\nAlice Carroll is the third and final Undine in training and is also the youngest of the main three. She\\'s a middle school student who also happens to be a pair. She gained a lot of attention from other people and has even appeared on the front cover of a magazine. She appears in episode 3 of the show and comes off as far more introverted and shy than the other two main characters. Like when she has to warn other gondola\\'s that she\\'s coming, but she says it too quietly. What made her popular is her skills as an Undine despite her introverted nature, and what\\'s interesting about her is her growth throughout the series to become more independent and less shy throughout the show. Another interesting aspect is her general demeanor with her new friends and practice buddies Akari and Aika. She often gets into small arguments with Aika and buts heads with her, and Aika likes calling her Juinor as well. She admires Akari\\'s optimism and carefree attitude and also learns from her clumsy mentor, Athena, to try and open up to others. As she grows more and more out of her shell, her confidence slowly grows throughout the narrative.\\nLast but not least in the Prima Undines list is Athena Glory, the final Water Fairy, and is referred to as the Siren due to her incredible singing voice. Like Alice, Athena doesn\\'t meet Akira and Alica until they are all still in training. And like Alice, Akira realizes it\\'s her because of a magazine/newspaper like Aika did with Alice. As mentioned before, Athena is extremely clumsy, to the point where it\\'s a running gag, and Alice\\'s total indifference due to just getting used to it is also a running gag. Despite her clumsy nature, she\\'s also more reserved than her friends, and she still gives Alice some helpful advice about opening up and accepting help from others. While she\\'s not as present as the other two mentors, she still gets enough screen time to really drive home this relationship with Alice. And just like Aika and Akira, there\\'s more alike with Alice and Athena than one would expect, but more on that in a later review.\\nThere are a few minor characters that I would like to mention. First, there\\'s Akatsuki Izumo, an appetence Salamander who helps maintain Aqua\\'s climate and also loves to call Akari Sideburns and pulls on her hair to mess with her, like how his older brother likes to mess with him (As an older brother to at least one of my sisters, I can relate to that). He\\'s the first customer that Akari has, and while he likes to ask for her help when it comes to confessing to Alicia, he does genuinely like having Akari around, even if he won\\'t admit it. He\\'s also friends with Woody, a delivery man who can fly around with a scooter and he really doesn\\'t do anything significant in the show aside from one episode in this season. There\\'s also the mailman who travels with a gondola of his own who also loves doing his job, to the point where he considers it his hobby. Lastly, there\\'s Grandma, who also has the best episode in the entire season. What I love about her is she\\'s very similar to Alicia in that she\\'s a kind and gentle woman, but she\\'s retired from the Undine scene and just wants to relax at home. When the group tries to learn how she was so legendary, they instead just enjoy their time with her. She even tells them the same philosophy I mentioned with Akari: To take anything in the world and enjoy it. And your dreams would come true. The setting gets more focus as the series goes on, but it gives us a taste of what we would enjoy.\\nLet\\'s wrap things up with the audiovisual section. The show does employ the 4:3 aspect ratio, so it can get some getting used too, but generally, the show is still nice to look at. The best thing about the visuals is the set design. It told us that Neo-Venenzia was based on Venice, and it feels like it from the backgrounds to the landmarks, to the architecture. It\\'s a thing of beauty. The running gag of chibi faces when making comedic scenes is also humorous because of the expressive character animation. The entire show feels distinct and lively. Listening to the music during writing this review, it has certainly become one of my personal favorite tracks in any medium. Everything feels so soothing and calming to the nerves that it immediately just lets you sink into the world without needless exposition. It\\'s a real thing of beauty. The voice acting is also great, as it compliments and gives a lot of character to the cast. This becomes even more apparent in Origination, but we\\'ll get to that. Athena\\'s songs are also a real treat. Certainly worth listening to.\\nWhile the first season can be a little aimless, it still does a good job introducing the cast and setting. The entire show is endearing and just full of life. It makes you want to continue seeing these characters go on different misadventures no matter what the circumstances. This was gonna be a review of the entire show, but this went on for far too long, so next, we\\'ll get into the nitty gritty with Natural!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8a92f1c615666bd95d30de8c7e676741'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I have been told from many different internet sites that Aria is the greatest of all slice of life animes. While slice of life animes usually don\\'t attract me, I decided to give Aria a try. I just finished the first season over about a week and still have the buzz of the last episode all over. It definitely was a unique watch.\\nAria takes place far in the future. Mankind has successfully given Mars a habitable environment, complete with the same force of gravity as Earth\\'s, an atmosphere that is equally capable of absorbing blue light, massive oceans rivaling Earth\\'s, and a very diverse biolife,\\nall imported from Earth and successfully multiplied. They have also created an extremely fast and efficient method of travel between Earth and Mars and now people come to Mars for vacations. Despite all this, the world of Aria is very rural, with very little technology at all. The only pieces of technology I can recall, in fact, are the space shuttles that float in the sky, the mailman\\'s flying motorbike, data cards, along with a very old type of phone.\\nThe anime focuses on the lives of three undiines [girls in training to become primas (girls who row the gondolas in this water filled planet)]. These girls have almost no problems in their lives and are free to train and relax as the days pass. Its peaceful, relaxing, stress-free, but I can\\'t say I was really able to relax that much while watching this show.\\nThe story by itself is fine I suppose. Many of the middle episodes were a little too slow and calming, but the end episodes were good. The problem is that the whole time I was watching this anime, I was dying to know answers that were never going to be answered. For example, there was one episode where the whole girl team goes to a uninhabited island and have a good time at the beach. Somewhere in there, one of the girls says \"I\\'m so happy to swim in the ocean. Nobody can swim in the oceans back at Man Home anymore so I\\'ve never done it before\". Ehhhh is that so? Exactly what happened to the oceans back on Earth that they are no longer alright to swim in? Is there mass pollution on Earth now or are the oceans too cold or what? I really wanted the anime to stop focusing on peace on Mars and transfer to the potential mayhem happening on Earth. It never does though, and I am left with no answers.\\nI can\\'t say I am one of the people of enjoy this kind of anime. I really just don\\'t see the charm in it. Why are slice of lifes so typical in lacking any elements that make other anime so great? An anime can still be a slice of life anime and at the same time contain drama, action, adventure, Plot. Slice of life doesn\\'t have to equate to happy go lucky peaceful animes featuring an almost all female cast doing almost nothing (looking at you Lucky Star). But at least Lucky Star was humorous, this anime was not. It was basically a sleep inducer, with almost every episode almost putting me to sleep. A better adjective for this anime would be \\'boring\\'. I\\'m sorry but in such an interesting science fiction world such as this, I want to see some science fiction, not some slice of life sleep inducer.\\nLots of people like this type of anime though, so I\\'ll go ahead and recommend it. However, people like me, who like a core plot directing the anime with action, humor, drama, romance, or whatever will flee from anime like this and go back to other slice of life animes with those things, such as NHK Ni Youkoso, Toradora, or Clannad.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e90b88a21004028ef06371e639990f77'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'If I were to describe this anime with a single word, the word would probably be \"boring\". Surprising perhaps, given that it lies in the \"Good\" region of my rating scales, but that\\'s what this anime is. In this case, \"boring\" isn\\'t used so much to label \"Aria\" as an unwatchably dull anime (though to some it probably is) as to describe what actually happens in it, which is absolutely nothing. For \"Aria\", in many ways, represents the very essence of a slice-of-life anime.\\nIn \"Aria\", there are no evil villains to fight, no complicated plots to untangle, no philosophical conundrums to contemplate... just about the\\nonly interesting detail in \"Aria\" is that it\\'s set on Mars, a Mars of the future that resembles Venice with its abundance of water and gondolas. But don\\'t let this exotic location fool you into thinking this is a setting for a futuristic sci-fi anime, because you\\'ll be sorely disappointed. That detail is pretty much restricted to being background information - as far as the anime itself is concerned, it may as well be set in Venice, as it doesn\\'t really do much with the Mars bit.\\nBeyond its settings, \"Aria\" is plain to such an extent that no measurable aspect of this anime stands out in any way: the animation is ok... in a boring way; the music... despite often having unconventional melody progressions that gave it a distinct feel, only manage to leave an impression of being boringly good; as for the content... it\\'s virtually non-existent. Every episode is pretty much just a case of the unremarkable characters going about their mundane daily tasks - they barely even qualify for the adventure-of-the-week description. But then, this is what the slice-of-life genre is all about, right? Yes, \"Aria\" may not be the most interesting of anime, but it does deliver in the department where this kind of anime is expected to deliver, and that is in the \"heart\" of the show - the part that gives it that indescribable feel good factor. This is epitomised by the last episode, which is a very typical slice-of-life open ending where there\\'s no grand finale, but there\\'s a vague sense of temporary closure at the end, with the option of extending into a second season wide open. But despite the lack of a climax, it does leave you bursting with a wonderful glowing feeling inside, with a twinge of sadness that comes from reaching the end of the series that you\\'ve become fond of. It\\'s this that allows \"Aria\" to soar above the sum of its very plain parts.\\nEven though I have a soft spot for Aria, I\\'d hesitate to recommend it to many people. A lot of them would probably fall asleep watching it. Other slice-of-life anime have additional aspects to keep you watching - Genshiken has its comedy and entertainment values; Planetes has its humble (and also not so humble) heroics and intense drama; Paradise Kiss has its eccentricity and interesting relationship dynamics... \"Aria\" doesn\\'t have any of these things, and instead offers the viewer a simple yet hard to quantify pleasure that comes from watching a slice-of-life that\\'s been distilled down to its purest form. It\\'s something for the connoisseurs of the genre to slowly enjoy. And if you ask them why it\\'s good, their response would probably be the same as mine: it... just is!', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5a6341e8aad03251e949fea9750eaf4d'}>,\n",

The story does however give a romantic view of the world, from small things to big, and is quite beautifully done at times. One of the points that I really like about the story is how the concluding episodes tie back to the beginning to give the story a very wholesome feeling.\\nAnimation: The artwork was splendidly done and really enhanced the mood. I noticed that the series' depiction of water especially, a central theme to the show, was beautifully portrayed and could be mesmerizing\\nin its serenity.\\nSound: The sound is elegant and fits well with the rest of the anime. Although not outstanding on its own, it really works well to create the tranquil mood that defines the series so well.\\nCharacter: The characters were solid and thoroughly enjoyable. The main trio's personalities worked well in tangent with one another which provided for a lot of fun scenes. The supporting roles were also developed well and they contributed to the anime's overall theme and storyline. Every new character that Akari met had something to add that gave more meaning to the story.\\nEnjoyment: Despite a lot of solid good points about the series, the slow pace was honestly boring at times. There wasn't enough to draw me in and give me incentive to continue watching other than a desire to see watch a beautiful story. The story didn't have much tragedy, romance, or action through which to provide excitement and could feel lacking at times. In the end, the slow pace really impaired my ability to fully enjoy the show.\\nOverall: There were many points I liked about the story and several others I disliked. In the end though, the story synthesized its elements into a well-developed piece. The story, art, sound, and character development all came together to produce a beautiful and idealistic story that leaves you feeling relaxed and content.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6983240178e3a728daec1d7b588d9924'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Aria has garnered one of the most interesting reputations I have seen. Put on such an impossibly high pedestal yet still as polarizing as any other slice of life series if not more so makes it an oddity that one can't help but be curious about. And, if nothing else, Aria is a very unique challenge and experience for just about anyone.\\nAria is about a group of girls who want to become the best professional boat rowers possible. There is a lot of food and tea in between.\\nAria, for better or worse, doesn't change much throughout the course of the series. For\\nme this caused an already episodic and formulaic series to wear thin even faster. Most of the episodes end with a message about appreciating the beauty of life, or something similar, accompanied by scenery porn and calming music. While this is admittedly quite comfy, it would work infinitely better if the series didn't run fifty-two episodes and one OVA because there's is only so many times you can impress me with an all too similar life lesson and scenery porn, Aria.\\nIt goes without saying slice of life series usually don't have much in the way of story in their attempt to be as feel good as possible. While not unexpected Aria sacrifices more than most since it actually does have clear overarching story with the three main characters trying to become Undines. Unfortunately this only gets sporadic focus throughout and ultimately isn't as rewarding as it should be. Instead we get a a lot of episodes focusing on the main characters doing something outside of that main goal and there is really no sense of progression.\\nRegardless of the meandering structure I did enjoy the main characters of Aria a good deal despite not knowing if I wanted to pat their heads or violently face fuck them. A wise man once told me multitasking is key. They all have good characterization as well as cute designs, which is all that they really needed to have for this type of story. Like many other things in Aria they can come off as overly sappy but I suppose that is part of the charm.\\nAside from that there are a few minor issues I had with Aria. I didn't quite understand the character of Alicia who everybody in the series has a massive lady boner over. She is portrayed as ethereal and perfect which I suppose is setup for later episodes which show her face some of her faults, but these are less faults than they are sympathetic and endearing traits thus making the odd direction of her character pointless or at the very least not as effective as it could have been. The super natural elements in the series seem like they are abandoned just as quickly as they are picked up which I assume there is more to them in the manga but we are left with what we get in the show. Finally, the dialogue gave me diabetes. I know that just kind of comes with the territory of Aria but it really is over the top sometimes.\\nDespite all my misgivings with Aria I still find the series incredibly thoughtful and charming. The atmosphere is unmatched and with the soft colors of the art and serene music the series is just on another level when it comes to aesthetics. Though I probably will never appreciate Aria and the slice of life genre as much as most, I can't help but enjoy the simplistic beauty of its tranquil and contemplative moments. And really, what else does Aria aim to do if not that.

Having gone through a fair amount of distress this past year, I was looking for something that could bring some tranquility to past few hectic months. Watching Aria brought me this, and so much more, and I'll explain later on.\\nThe story takes place in the 24th century on a terraformed Mars (now called Aqua), where Akari (our MC) strives to be a top class Undine in Neo Venezia. Truly sticking to the nature of SoL, past the first 3-4 episodes Aria the Animation is almost entirely episodic, yet it never feels boring or\\npointless despite the direction of the plot. Each episodes digs into each of the characters and their relationships with one another, and how they grow as people. It feels real, and it feels natural. Even the trope beach/hot springs episodes are extremely well done with 0 pandering fan service, truly sticking to the themes and ideas Aria is presenting.\\nArt and Sound is where this show really starts to kick in. The art style is absolutely superb, with lush colors used in every frame and character design being memorable. The animation is very high quality as well, besides some of the chibi moments that feel very jarring next to the usually-smooth animation.\\nAs for Sound, Aria hands down, has one of the best OSTs around period. From the relaxing OP to the light-hearted ED, and even all of the background soundtracks playing throughout the show, the music for this show is astoundingly well-realized. It is an absolute perfect fit, both for the Italian setting and for the overall mood of the show. Special mention to the OP which is, by far, one of the best OPs I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.\\nThe characters are also surprisingly well-developed for the plot being as lax as it is. All of them are likable, and they all serve a purpose in the plot. Special mention to how well developed Aqua is as well, almost every plothole that could have come from essentially setting Venice on Mars was covered (i.e weather being artificially controlled, gravity being regulated undergrounds by gnomes etc.). You can clearly see how much thought the author put into not only the characters, but Aqua itself.\\nAll these elements fuse together to form an experience unlike any other. No drama, no action, no conspiracies, no villains, just a tranquil story of three young girls realizing their dreams, little by little in a beautiful world. You really do feel bliss when watching this, even more so after going through some rough times. Aria teaches you to look at the bright and positive things in life, a profound yet very forgotten message in the current industry saturated with excessive action and drama.\\nAria the Animation is definitely as least worth a try, if for no other reason that it just being different from any other show out there. A masterfully crafted anime, held back by a couple of technical issues, it truly is a heart warming and positive experience.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '63663adba697d6b14c489eed0e780801'}>,\n",

If you take a look at the reviews and the overall rating it's nothing short of glowing. Take my review with a grain of salt, since I'm definitely not a big slice of life person.\\nTake any literature class, or even high school English, and you'll most likely come across the plot diagram. Introduction, rising action, climax and resolution. Conflict drives almost every story, and in terms of anime it tends to be on a fantastic scale. The end of the world, the fate of a nation\\nor even  the ebb and flow of a romance in a harem or romantic comedy anime. Well, aria doesn't really have any conflict on a fantastic scale. In fact, it doesn't really have conflict at all. Any conflict that does pop up is quickly resolved to demonstrate is easy going mood. It barely suffices to have the skeleton of a plot. Akari, a girl from earth, travels to a terraformed mars made up entirely of water specifically to the the city of neo-venizia. It's essentially just venice on mars or Aqua as the show calls it. Akari is trying to become a professional gondola tour guide within the city, and the show supposedly follows her in trying to achieve her goal.  The pace is glacial, and most episodes are only tangentially related to Akari trying to become an undine if at all (said tour guide). Most episodes are simply the characters traveling the city by gondola in between ordinary activities.\\nThe lack of any kind of real plot irks me a bit but I'm getting ahead of myself. It's a slice of life show, one shouldn't expect it to be plotted like a spider web. Slice of life shows are about character interactions. Unfortunately, though initially likeable, the cast doesn't really develop much beyond basic archetypes. Among the  undines in training, there's the driven, uptight type in Aika, the reserved and mysterious Alice, and the airheaded, unfailingly cheery Akari. For their teachers and seniors, there's the motherly, gentle type in Alica, and the strict older sister of Aika in Akira.  There's a curious lack of any major male characters perhaps attributable to the show's heavy use of moe. The three trainee undines often react and act the exact same way, with blushing, cries of 'ehhhhhhhh?' or 'ahhh' and deformed cartoonish reaction faces. A few have their own catch phrases and keyed reactions to situations. That's really about it.\\nSo, with a ghost of a plot, a very basic character set, what exactly does aria have to keep you watching? The show actually turns out to be more than the sum of it's parts. The music is laid back flemenco and is very good, if recycled a bit, and the art depicting neo venizia is usually beautiful, except when it takes a nose dive in quality due to poor backgrounds or shoddy animation. The show has a genuinely calming effect and manages to be very charming. It takes away any stress you have and transports you to a world free of any kind of strife. So is aria a good anime? Probably. A masterpiece? Not in my opinion. If you're looking for deep characters, action or a complex plot, steer far away. It's not to me what it's cracked up to be, but judging by the other reviews and the overall score I probably can't tell you whether you'll like this or not. In any case, it's decent enough to warrant at least a few episodes worth of viewing from their each viewer can probably decide if they want to continue with the rest of the Aria franchise.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '75d1a01f6608a95e39850d552fa68ae2'}>,\n",

Strangely enough, it works. Actually, bludgeoning likely isn't the best verb. Sedating is more suitable, since Aria is probably the most relaxing show in recent memory.\\nAesthetically, Aria the Animation is a gorgeous series. From the pristine water that the gondolas so gracefully glide over to the well kept stone buildings, the city of Neo Venezia is brought to life by its splendid colors and vibrant tone. There's a feeling of life and soul breathed into it, yet it's calming in\\nits tranquil beauty. History is exuded from every structure, almost as if Neo Venezia has existed for well over a thousand years, like its Earth-born counterpart.\\nThe characters are well designed and well animated, all unique and memorable enough to endear themselves to the viewer. Even the bit characters are given appearances that don't feel entirely generic, which is a definitely plus. During its more amusing moments, the characters' faces turn into some of the best chibi faces ever brought to anime.\\nThe audio, from the stellar voice acting to the soothing background music, is simply divine. While the music wouldn't likely stand on its own, it's the perfect complement to the series, bringing to life the soothing rhythm of Neo-Venetian life through acoustic guitars and soft singing.\\nAs a slice of life series, the story aspect takes a backseat to the characters and their interactions with each other and their environment. Strangely, it's when the story veers away from everyday life that Aria's at its weakest. The few supernatural-themed episodes are a strange departure from the norm, not really having any bearing on the overarching plot.\\nWhile it can be argued that they're perfectly fine since the whimsical  overarching plot is broad enough in scope to allow the encompassing of a few more somber subplots, I still feel that Aria is at its slowest during these strange few episodes.\\nAlso, as a slice of life anime, the characters are the focus. The three undines in training, Alice, Aika, and Akari, are supported by their superiors Athena, Akira, and Alicia respectively as they go through and explore their daily lives, becoming ever closer to achieving their collective dream of becoming master gondoliers (Undines, as they are known).\\nTo make for even more lighthearted fare, the main trio are usually accompanied by the absurdly cute President Aria, a cat who has the sheer force of personality to carry an entire episode by himself... and seems to be harboring a deep secret that has only been alluded to. Animals have been put in series for the sake of cuteness overload and comedy before, but President Aria is arguably the best around.\\nMost will probably argue this, and I can see why. He's obnoxious enough to deter some viewers, though it didn't work on me in the slightest, so fair warning if you find small animals who yell random gibberish annoying beyond belief.\\nNow, before I write a dissertation on why I think President Aria is the best cat in history ever (He has a sailor hat! What's not to love in a cat who wears a sailor hat?), I'd best wrap things up.\\nAria the Animation is a fun little series that does well in breaking away from the mold. Original for slice of life fare, with a few deviations that I felt detracted more than added anything, it will sedate you with its snail-like pacing and soothing aesthetics. Some may be put off by this, but rest assured that it's not nearly as boring as it sounds. Also notable is the overall optimistic tone. While the mood may drift into the melancholic at times, it never loses its upbeat charm and aforementioned whimsy.\\nWhile I haven't viewed its sequels yet, and I do plan to, I can comfortably say that Aria sits toward top of my favorite series list. It does Slice of Life differently, and it does it well. Like an actual gondola drifting through the canals of Venice, Aria is relaxing and slow, the whole purpose being an observation of the everyday life of the people.\\nNever before has a show left me feeling completely at ease, unburdened by the hardships of this world. 9/10 stars\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b63e714925d9be619ab0c9a5bd38da9'}>,\n",

There is no moe; there are no crazy plot turns; there is no artsy action. Instead, Aria the Animation goes deeper than you think; judging a book by its cover becomes less and less relevant when diving into the waters of Neo-Venezia.\\nStory: 9/10\\nI really, really wanted to label this as \"slice of life\" and\\nmove on. But honestly, I couldn\\'t - not because there actually was a crazy, flip-flopping story you\\'d normally expect, but because every episode was fresh and had meaning, not just some slapstick humor and that was that. There were several heart-warming moments; nothing so sad it left you depressed and nothing so happy it seemed fake, but lessons like enjoying the little things in life really hit home here. This wasn\\'t an anime of plenitude, but instead one of deeper meanings below a facade of happy, go-lucky trio of girls. The constant references to Italy, Italian mythology and beliefs, as well as traditional food and drink kept the atmosphere lively and had a unique sense of familiarness, despite this being on a completely different planet. In general, though, I loved every last bit of every part of the story. There wasn\\'t a plot point I didn\\'t enjoy. The warm feeling inside after each episode made me think that this really hit the spot.\\nArt: 9/10\\nNow this is slightly older than I would have liked, but the animation was excellent. Nothing was skimped, from the beautifully recrafted Venice (hence the name Neo-Venezia) to each character\\'s uniform ornamental arrangements. I couldn\\'t find anything wrong with the animation style; everything was beautifully crafted and honed to near-perfection. There were frequent changes in style, such as when a character said something sarcastic, their faces become much simpler, to reflect such humor. In my book, any sort of simple, yet elegant art gets a darn good score anyway. Plus, nothing was ever an eyesore, and every scene generally had something new in it, reflecting the continually entertaining and changing environments the characters interacted in.\\nCharacter: 9/10\\nThe characters really shine in this anime as well. There wasn\\'t too much of an airhead, too much of a tsundere (kind of) or any sort of typical anime characterizations; no, this was something much more special. Each character fit the role laid out for them almost too perfectly. Every personality was represented, albeit in a toned-down and subtle sort of way. I found it hard to find a character I hated, for crying out loud. Every anime has that one character you wish were dead or flying into another dimension, forever forgotten and alone. But this was something unique, something I found vaguely comforting that I wasn\\'t willing death, but life. Their daily interactions, though very wistful, belies a childlike tone and lessons of life, things rarely found in anime nowadays.\\nOverall: 9/10\\nAnyway, this was n interesting amalgamation: a blending of whimsical, steampunk-like science fiction, slice-of-life, some slapstick humor and genuine life lessons really impacted my heart. I kept feeling all warm and tingly inside, something you should be prepared for with plenty food items, because the food on here looks dang delicious. Generally, though, this deserved a high-ranking score, because of the lack of things I had problems with. I never had to pause for effect, never had to stop watching it because of boredom nor because it was too much; but it floated along at its own pace, never quite hurrying, yet never becoming tedious.

I feel that it is necessary for the entire collection to be presented together since a potential viewer should watch the entire collection instead of just any one part.\\nI won’t be describing what ARIA is about; it is well-described in the synopsis and other reviews. You too, would want to be\\nthe one discovering and understanding what ARIA is about to you.\\nLet me first give you a rundown on what you can expect from ARIA:\\n1.\\tYou want to take a break from the usual action-packed and angst-filled anime. ARIA is a slow-paced and smooth-sailing anime. Every single episode, except the ending episodes of Origination, is standalone, but all of them will contribute to creating your vision of the world of Aqua. ARIA will not invoke strong emotions and desires, only a sense of calmness and curiosity.\\n2.\\tYou want the feeling of happiness. ARIA epitomizes happiness. Every single act or occurrence or thing that appears in ARIA will bring happiness to its characters. And happiness is contagious.\\n3.\\tYou wonder about the state of the world today, and think that the future of the world is bleak. ARIA will make you think otherwise. ARIA is filled with so much faith in its people and so much optimism in its future that it can probably bring hope to someone in (insert worst situation you can think of).\\nHow you should watch ARIA in order to enjoy it?\\n1.\\tWatch it in order. Aria the Animation will introduce to you the setting and its characters. Aria the Natural will take you on a tour of its world and the many mystical happenings that occur within it. Aria the Origination will delve and develop each character to the fullest before concluding.\\n2.\\tDon’t rush through the story. Savor every moment and every scene, like tasting a glass of well-aged wine. Heck, re-watch an episode if you want to. I sometimes tend to replay a single scene over and over before being satisfied of the feels it was conveying.\\n3.\\tOpen your mind and your heart. Don't be too quick to dismiss something as impossible, stupid, or lame. ARIA will contain varying degrees of these elements, and you should look deeper into the abstract meaning of each of them instead of judging hastily.\\nExperience and maturity are essential in order to appreciate this collection to the fullest.

If so, Doctor Penguin recommends a good dose of Aria the Animation to cheer you up. This delightful slice-of-life story is sure to have you smiling again as you follow along the training of three young undines (gondoliers) on the newly terraformed planet, Aqua (Mars). Known for its sleepy pace, serene settings, and whimsical nature, it is sure to delight any slice-of-life fan. Fans that require more story driven shows or action sequences will obviously want to avoid this one. On to the breakdown!\\nStory: 5/10 - Slice-of-life shows\\ncertainly aren't usually known for their complex plots and storytelling. Aria is no exception to the rule. In fact, it probably contains the simplest plot out of any show I've seen. The show is episodic in nature, with each storyline propelling the characters toward a new life lesson. I enjoyed that the writers for the show avoided overly sentimental or sappy story lines for the most part. They kept the same lightheartedness atmosphere consistent through the entire series. I still have to give it a low score though, because like I said, there's not much story to be found.\\nArt: 7/10 - The art style works well for the anime. The artists use lots of bright vivid colors to reinforce the cheerful atmosphere. Their recreation of Venice was competently done, but I think they missed out a little on a chance to really make the settings spectacular. Character designs were fairly traditional, but they worked. The only oddity in the show was the design of President Aria, the mascot for the Aria company. What the hell was up with that cat?\\nSound: 7/10 - The voice actors (I watched the Japanese version) were average. No one performance stuck out as incredible or awful. The soundtrack fit well with the animation, but isn't something I'd listen to as a standalone.\\nCharacter: 7/10 - The characters above all were very likeable. That's probably the most important aspect of a slice-of-life series. I found myself emotionally connected to them throughout the story, which is very crucial for my only personal enjoyment. If I were to be more critical each character in the show is a little underdeveloped.  I would have liked to have seen a little more back story for the main characters. At only 13 episodes, with each of those having very little plot, it's an understandable problem though. The only other thing I can say about the characters were that a few were a bit too idyllic. A few flaws always helps make a character more believable.\\nEnjoyment: 9/10 -  On to the intangibles... How is it that everything else gets rated 7 or below, and this receives a 9? I really don't know. It just made me really happy as I was watching it.\\nOverall: 8/10\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd61d1a5e9d6b9c551ebd2c3554dadc68'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': '(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\\n[Synopsis]: In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company – a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city’s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria follows Akari and her friend’s progress as Undines and their heartfelt\\ninteractions with the people of Aqua.\\n[Characters]:\\nMizunashi Akari, the protagonist of the show, through her characterization sets the tone for Aria quite well. She’s highly optimistic, friendly, and cheerful all of which go closely hand-in-hand with attitude of the show. Her ability to find joy in the mundane speaks most chiefly to one of Aria’s primary messages as well as the show’s laid back, slice of life nature. Akari’s correspondence with her friend Ai back on Manhome, previously known as Earth, serves as a useful framework to deliver thematic sentiments at the beginning and end of each episode as well as allow the show to clue in the viewer to certain jargon and in-world terms such as Sylphs, Gnomes, and Salamanders without addressing them directly, allowing the information to present itself naturally within the dialogue of the show. Akari’s sentimental and caring nature makes her the perfect character with which to explore the world of Aqua as her own personality and thoughts reflect so closely to what the show tries to accomplish.\\nGranzchesta Aika, an Undine employed under the Himeya company and Akari’s close friend, serves a few purposes within the show. Her catchphrases and sharp remarks are the source of a good deal of the show’s comedy as well as Akari’s comical reactions. Additionally, Aika, similar to Alice, is perhaps the more passionate of the three in regards to her job as an Undine – though they all aspire to one day be like their teachers, Aika vocally strives to be the best Undine possible though her work ethic and overall attitude may not reflect this trait. As opposed to Akari she felt somewhat under-investigated as as character with only a handful of notable traits and so I can only imagine she will be fleshed out in the future.\\nThe last of the main trio of apprentice Undines is Carroll Alice. Though she starts with a slight complication concerning her attitude I found that it was dismissed incredibly quickly rather than serving as a source of development for her and while I enjoyed Alice is a character more than most others, I felt that this aspect of her character was mishandled. Despite liking the character as much as I did, I felt she too was a little under-explored and while complex characters are not a necessity within a slice of life setting, due to the calm and relaxed nature of Aria, these elements would help keep ones attention all the better.\\nOne of the important things concerning the characters that I think the show did well was in how it portrayed the relationship between the three apprenticed Undines and their mentors. The three main characters very straightforwardly mirror their seniors however I liked the fact that each characters personality felt influenced in some way by their teacher. This made the relationships feel more genuine and moreover, the fact that they were not perfect copies of each other helped reinforce their individuality as characters.\\n[Art/Animation]:\\nThe animation felt fairly par for the course and while it was not flashy in its presentation it was not lacking either. The true success within this section stems from the show’s setting which was executed fantastically. The setting of a Venetian city on a distant planet is presented excellently and while the city itself does not feel extensively explored, the colors and serene atmosphere of the city support the tone of the show wonderfully. Furthermore, the countryside settings lined with wind turbines and the intermittent tree-covered mountaintops add diversity to the water-dominant environment but also display a great marriage between the show’s anachronistic setting and its sci-fi premise in an aesthetically pleasing way. The art of the show is certainly a point of triumph for Aria.\\n[Story]:\\nAs Aria The Animation is one of the premiere slice of life shows, the story is both laid back in demeanor and episodic in nature. The events of each episode succeed in presenting a relaxing mood through the interactions between Akari, her friends, and the people of Aqua and while there are the occasional obstacles and problems that arise they are resolved by the end of the episode and punctuated by tooth-achingly sweet, optimistic observation that closes out the theme of what transpired.\\nAs the characters and the world serve as the two primary points of interest in the show due to its reliance on them rather over a more traditional story I was surprised how little the city felt fleshed out and how underrepresented its populace was. The city setting is portrayed fantastically and the bustling of the crowds and of people nearby is ever present within the background of the show however its main characters only actually interact with a small handful of people throughout the 13 episodes which somewhat contradicts the show’s premise and best interest. The city itself was featured in an aesthetic way on plenty of levels however I feel that the inclusion of more people would have gone a long way in presenting a slightly more  lively and believable atmosphere. For this reason, it felt to me like Aria The Animation is mostly a source of groundwork being laid for future exchanges and interactions while harboring a somewhat wanting number of these things within itself. That being said, the exchanges that do take place are sincere and heartwarming and I think the show has great potential in this regard to both develop its characters and create more meaningful interactions between them.\\n[Music]:\\nWhen I think about the music of Aria I am reminded of how the art of the show supported it as I think a very similar thing takes place in this category. The music, while not necessarily iconic, blends together with the aesthetic and tone of the show in amazing ways and while no individual song sticks out in my mind, the effect of the music on the show was one of the more memorable elements of Aria.\\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]:\\nAria The Animation was a show with a decent number of triumphs concerning its overall presentation and attempted tone however a fair number of shortcomings in the form of lack of characterization and a more extensive cast. The show is certainly worth a watch and while the show may not be amazing it certainly lays a good groundwork for what could become an even more interesting setting with a larger and more in-depth cast.\\nRating: 6\\nI gave Aria The Animation a 6 because it was overall a decent show however it was significantly held back in a variety of ways mostly in relation to its entertainment value. Because of the slow and serene tone of the show I will look next to the characters in order to compensate for the slice of life elements of the show in order to keep my attention and make me invested in the events of each episode however as the cast is relatively small and the main characters with the exception of Akari lacking significantly in character depth and traits my attention falters and I am left with a great atmosphere wherein nothing of real note or concern takes place. The pros outweigh the cons here and the atmosphere of the show really is executed beautifully but these lackluster elements hold the show back from climbing any higher.\\n[Recommendations]:\\nAria The Animation is slice of life at its most pure and for this reason I would highly recommend it to any fans of the genre as it does a great job in many regards. At the same time, the show somewhat requires of the viewer very much what it preaches over several episodes – that one must be capable of finding enjoyment in the mundane. Other slice of life shows will often bolster their content with either comedy or certain other story elements and while these things are present in small doses in Aria it is most primarily concerned with the somewhat trivial events that take place and in this way demand a little extra from the viewer. The comedy of the show is highly reliant on the catchphrase interactions between the main characters however there are a handful of stand alone jokes though I would not recommend Aria as a comedy to someone anything less than enthralled with the other elements of the show to begin with. One final thing I will say is that the world of Aria is an interesting one that speaks to both fantasy and sci-fi simultaneously though, like the comedy of the show, I would not recommend it solely for these reasons as they are not the central point of the show even though their execution is quite great.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '75d2768d8a1950209384204f3d1b8a18'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"This will be the first of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews will be based on how I felt after finishing the season my first time.\\nARIA the ANIMATION is the first season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's AQUA and ARIA manga series. I will say right off the bat that this is not an anime for everyone, for those who cannot stand slow paced, happy and calm slice of life shows this anime IS NOT for you and should turn around now :P\\nStory: In the year 2301, Mars has been terraformed into a water planet and\\nrenamed Aqua. Neo Venezia, an exact replica of the old city of Venice, was build on Aqua. It is there where Mizunashi Akari, a girl that has come from Man-home (formerly called Earth), has arrived in hopes of becoming one of Neo-Venezia's trademark female gondoliers called undines. As a slice of life anime, there is not much of a real ongoing plot going as most of the episodes consists of the day to day life of Akari as she trains under Aria Company with her friends in order to become a full fledged undine. Regardless, each individual episode has a certain charm to it that draws you into the world of Aqua, so its not so bad.\\nArt: As far as the character art goes, it is nothing incredible, but it is consistent and well animated. The real charm in ARIA's graphics are in the backgrounds and landscapes which resemble the real Venice with incredible accuracy. The sky, the oceans, and the city looks beautiful in this anime and is a real treat to watch.\\nSound: This is without a doubt the best aspect of this show, the various instrumental and vocal songs in this show really makes you lose yourself in the world of ARIA and are just very enjoyable to listen to. Some of these songs are so relaxing you might find yourself slowly drift into drowsiness sometimes when watching this show.\\nCharacter: Another great aspect of this show are the characters, the six main undines we are introduced all have their own distinctive personalities and they all interact so well with each other that just watching them talk about everyday events is very entertaining to watch. I would describe ach character to you but its better to just experience them yourself to fully enjoy it.\\nEnjoyment: I'm surprised I managed to watch such a slow paced show yet not feel like I wasted my time. I was on the verge of falling asleep various times watching this yet I did not hate it. There is a certain charm in this show that kept making me come back to it. And im glad i did.\\nOverall: This is a very good show, however if you decide to watch it I recommend that you DONT marathon this 4-5 episodes at a time. This is an anime meant to be enjoyed at a slower pace over a longer period of time. Watching this show felt like going a tour around a city that both fictional and real. It was a very calming experience and i can definitely say I enjoyed watching it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3102d146fdae9dd1291f2c7e7965048f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'I would say that this show made me feel really good at night...\\nBut embarrassing remarks aren\\'t allowed ;-;\\nSo someone told me about an anime series that I had never heard of. He said that it was the greatest \"feel good\" series ever made. He called it the \"Aria\" series. So I looked it up on MyAnimeList and thought to myself, \"Holy crap, this show looks like it\\'s boring as hell.\" The part of me that thought that probably thought that it was due to the apparent lack of relatability that this show held. I mean, it\\'s a slice of life, but it\\'s in a fantasy\\nsci-fi world where the planet Mars has been converted into a water planet where humans can inhabit. It follows the lives of freaking boat tour guides. How relatable can this anime get?\\nAria is beautiful in the way it takes such a ridiculously unimaginable world and still makes the ride relatable. It does this through dynamic and colorful character interactions weaved in with little life lessons that we all can learn from. It\\'s a show about enjoying life to the fullest, and it dives into themes that you have probably bumped into during your life. For example, wanting to be a hero! Or that all good things must come to an end. Or that no matter where you are or who you are, there will always be a place where you belong. Combine these lovely themes with one of the most beautiful and peaceful atmospheres in anime, and you get this serene series about life and dreams.\\nPros:\\n- Calming and gorgeous atmosphere. Like said before, this is a prime example of a \"feel good\" series.\\n- Amazing cast of characters! There were no characters that I actively disliked.\\n- One of the best soundtracks in anime. It plays a huge role in setting up the atmosphere of the show.\\n- Simple yet still beautiful art. Neo Venezia just looks so cool!\\n- Great little life lessons that are executed beautifully! Makes the show incredibly relatable to, even if it\\'s a fantasy.\\n- Kick back and relax!\\n- No fanservice! OMG!!!\\nCons:\\n- A very simple story with no thought required. For people who want a show with even a shred of thinking needed, this one ain\\'t for you.\\n- Slow and peaceful, with 0 action. Action fans, go away!\\n- Fairly silly and seemingly pointless.\\n- This show isn\\'t very laugh out loud and jokes can get repetitive. (It does have its moments though.)\\n- No fanservice! OH NO!!!\\nStory: 9\\nThe premise is simple, but also pretty weird to most people. It\\'s about Akari, a young girl and upcoming undine (boat tour guide) who moved from Manhome (Earth) to Aqua (Mars) in order to pursue that career. At first, you may be like... what? Mars? It\\'s now filled with water, hosts a city that looks like Venice, and is actually habitable? The premise makes the setting look like it\\'s completely out of this world, which it is! However, despite this, through the characters interacting with each other, building the world, and living their normal lives, Aria\\'s story and themes are somehow very like our world. People live their lives, chase their dreams, and enjoy life in their own way. In other words, Aria is truly a Slice of Life. It isn\\'t cute girls doing cute things, it\\'s people doing normal things.\\nSo Aria\\'s story is just slice of life. What\\'s the main overlooking theme of the entire series? That, my friend, is miracles. Aria convinces you that miracles don\\'t just exist, they can be created by hand. Just look at Aqua! A formerly uninhabitable planet was turned into a beautiful and serene place through the power of human willpower. Nothing can get more miraculous than that. Aria\\'s depiction of miracles is truly beautiful.\\nArt: 8\\nAria\\'s art is pretty simple as well! It isn\\'t particularly high quality or anything, but it still captures the tranquil atmosphere of a fantasy world incredibly well! The character designs are also great, and the deformation during comedic moments is also hilarious! There isn\\'t much in this show to animate, since it\\'s a slow pace slice of life, but it can pull of high quality animations when it wants.\\nSound: 10\\nProbably the best aspect of this series is the OST. It\\'s quite literally porn for the ears. Serene, peaceful, and beautiful, the OST consists of extremely nostalgic pieces either on the piano or strings, and it sets up the amazing and easy going mood of the show incredibly well. Also, the OP and ED are some of the best songs I\\'ve ever heard. They both give off extremely nostalgic vibes and are definitely songs that I would listen to on repeat.\\nCharacter: 10\\nThe next best aspect of this series are the characters. The characters aren\\'t particularly special, but they fit their world so well and they definitely carry the story. All of the characters are lovable and have their own unique quirks, and the interactions that they have really pull you in. Also, it\\'s time to talk about their chibi deformations! All of the main undine characters have these incredibly hilarious chibi expressions during comedic scenes, and they each have their own unique one that makes them stand out! Their chibi faces always seem to be screaming out something, such as...\\nAkari: Hahi, hohe, what the hell is going on???\\nAika: Hey! Embarrassing remarks aren\\'t allowed!\\nAlice: I\\'m so done with this bullshit.\\nAlicia: Ara ara ara ara.\\nAkira: Dafuq did you just call me?\\nAthena: Derp.\\nAlso, President Aria is by far the best pet sidekick character ever conceived. He just has so much personality!\\nEnjoyment: 10\\nI smiled like a dork the whole way through. This series lives up to its name as the best \"feel good\" series so far, and I still got 3 more cours to watch!\\nOverall: 9\\nA great and peaceful series that you can just sit back, relax, enjoy some tea, and just turn off your brain while watching. While this type of series definitely isn\\'t for anyone, for those that click with it, it\\'ll be a serene experience that you won\\'t want to end.\\nTL;DR: \"The world is wonderful in the eyes of wonderful people.\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '98706ad16689b192cafb33726851c94c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Aria the Animation, a work that provokes mixed feelings. I was tempted to watch this show after being recommended to it by this site and after reading the reviews. I though I had found a show worth watching, but Aria was more like watching an overly corny reality show. Here´s my reasoning.\\nI watch anime in order to enjoy many things, the art, the music, the characters and most importantly, the story. Aria has all the previous, except a well-defined story. Now, slices of life are normal for this, but many use comedy to fill in the holes. Aria just wants to you to feel al\\nwarm and fuzzy, that is unacceptable for me. I want to feel something, be it laughter, sadness, anger or any emotion. Aria just tries to keep me relaxed with its stereotypical characters: the clumsy and kind-hearted protagonist, the equally kind-hearted tomboy and the silent, sweet girl that serves as an observer between these two.\\nIn terms of character development I saw none, regardless of what situations they´re put through, they remained the same throughout the entire show. Now, that is not a bad thing, slices of life tend to be a bit more difficult than your average story, since they try to portray the happenings of everyday life.\\nI felt no strong feelings towards the music (one of the most important things I note in any audio-visual work), and in this Aria excellls. It doesn't want me to feel any strong emotion, it just wants me to smoke a blunt or drink some coffee and relax.\\nAria achieves its goal greatly: for you to feel nothing and just watch the everyday life of an unremarkable trio of girls. Perhaps that is one reason why it has such good reviews.\\nUnfortunately I don´t watch anime to experience the same kind of morbid reactions most reality viewers enjoy. I watch it for the stories, the scares, the action, (God forbid) even romance, but not for the sake of watching it. That´s why Aria scores less than average in my book.\\nIf you want to experience reallity anime, this might be the first, or at least the most known of its kind. If that´s the case, by all means, you might even enjoy it, but if you want to feel something, you are better off going somewhere like I did.\\nAt the time of this review, the reviewer has dropped Aria the Natural at episode 6.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2e38a6c5c9cc34e4c9e793aa8531fc84'}>,\n",

It evens gets more dark when Aria wants you to think Akari doesn\\'t know she is affected by these narcotics \" When\\ni came to Aqua ( Alice\\'s house) i wanted to be ......( i dont want to make any spoiler) ....... but then i started to see everything of this world was awesome (probably because of the narcotics)\", every time i see it that chapter i have to pause, cry and after 4 hours i continue watching.

You may not like the idea about chibi faces but trust me that chibi shit its so fucking great in Aria, I can\\'t understand why the fuck I liked it.\\nThe music (ost, opening, ending, what ever) is relaxing and well placed i dont know what well placed means but i am sure Aria did it.

As long as the premise and the characters are enjoyable, I can pretty much swallow any kind of SoL-experiences there is... mostly! When I was adviced to pick the Aria up, I was spectical, yes, but still optimistic enough to give it atry, and after the experience that I would describe at best as a \"4 hour nap-time\", I\\'m greatly dissapointed!\\nFirst of, what is good? Or \"good\",\\nif you will. Well... the art is decent, often times quite pretty, actually! The Aqua as a location is pretty to look at, but not very innovative nor interesting to look at. I mean... when you have a Mars turned into \"secon Earth\", there should be imo something much more interesting to invest into, than snowflies and bizarre cats for crying out loud! The sounds of the characters are really mellow and soft - read; I hate them! - but the music is really beautiful, expecially the opening songs and endings, with their lovely animations - I just adore those \"brush-painted\" endings so much!

The story told in under a 13-episodes can be amazing, if the story is good, just as the show with 50-episodes or more can be jut as afwul, if the story is bad!

Within\\nthis brave new world, the story centers on a young girl who aspires to be a great undine in the canals of Neo Venezia, a place that reminisces Venice in Manhome.  Contrary to what you’d expect from a futuristic show, the series does not offer a world that is a continuation of life on earth but rather a re-start, (even the names of the characters all starting with A gives us an Adam-like sense of a fresh beginning) thus, offering a world devoid of the robotic experiences of the technological urban life. Here, you are exposed to beautiful scenery of Neo Venezia, like a guest in the gondolas of sweet undines, gazing through the city surrounded by nature and the serenity that comes with it. Not to mention the relaxing music that accompanies you in every step of the way.\\nAnother interesting aspect of the series that I did not expect is the way the ‘story’ is revealed. If you expect to get curious about what is going to happen next, it is not the case with Aria. The whole experience is like the acknowledgement of little things in life that are more than enough to make someone happy. Instead of a storyline, the series reflects an alternative dream-like world, an anime version of Neverlamd,so to speak. The imaginary elements such as gondoliers being called undines - mythological nymphs - and the top three gondoliers being the three water fairies add to the man-made, dreamy nature of Aqua. Here, you can get away from the worries of mundane life affairs and take it easy. If anything, it is not a travel to the future but to the depths of human nature, revealing its secrets, wishes, and dreams.\\nAs can be inferred from what I already mentioned, thematically, the show focuses on what it means to be human, how to appreciate the small things we normally take for granted in life and more than anything, what it means to be able to dream without any boundaries of the adult perspective on life.\\nIf you need some tranquility and recharge for your soul, this show surely feels like a warm hug and the whole experience will tickle you all the way to the end, letting you take a taste of exploring the future in the most nostalgic manner possible.

Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don’t change… Both are precious. Don’t you feel the same?\"\\nI watch anime to enjoy myself. Every fan does. I have horrible days, awesome ones, but always after, I find myself opening up my Laptop and watching some good ol’ anime. You see, there’s a special charm to the medium. A unique aspect that distinguishes it above all the rest. Whether it be its exclusiveness to its respective origin country, or just the shows in general\\nthat can only be made from the minds of the Japanese, I always find myself appreciating the wonderful world that anime has given me. I haven’t watched enough shows for my opinion to matter, if I’m being completely honest, due to time constraints and a filled-up schedule but whenever I come across an anime that I love, I obsess over it for days, weeks, even months. With this obsession comes my desire to write a review that expresses my thoughts and why I cherish the said anime with all my heart. And it seems Aria the Animation is one of the few that have rekindled this feeling.\\nEnter the beautiful world of Neo Venezia, the city of a now-populated, man-made planet named Aqua, which to no surprise to its name, is filled mostly with water. A Utopian wonderland filled with the bustling life of citizens and tourists alike, Neo Venezia is also the setting of which we meet our main protagonist for the first time, Mizunashi, Akari. Akari is a bright and cheerful girl, always optimistic in the face of conflict. Due to her positive mindset in life, she is constantly greeted with many characters who all come to be drawn into Akari’s liveliness. Among them are Aika and Alice, two other trainees who share the same goal as Akari. To not just be a Prima, but to also surpass their seniors. In the show, Prima’s are basically tour guides who introduce newcomers to the wonderful city of Neo Venezia in their gondolas. In reality, Neo Venezia could very well be Venice, located in Italy, with most of its area being filled with water and the presence of gondolas being felt everywhere. Think of Neo Venezia as the future of Venice.\\nThrough Akari and her friends’ desires, they come across many kinds of obstacles but always overcome them in one way or another. They help each other as friends should and trud through it all no matter how tough the going gets. Yet, the problem that matters most is not about achieving their goal and becoming a Prima, it’s when their expedition ends and they are forced to part ways due to the fact they’re all in their respective rival companies. An internal conflict that lingers in the mind. What happens when they become Primas? Will they be able to maintain their friendship? Will reaching their destination bring more hardships? Questions like these are addressed in the anime in a way that stirs up drama genuinely, not with any half-assed melodramatic exaggeration and tons of crying, but with actual sincere emotion that is believable and convincing.\\nEach episode begins with an opening monologue that leads to the pleasant and calming Opening, Undine, a song so beautiful, you could end up trying to sing along with it (at least that’s what I did). Each episode is devoted to fulfilling its role as individual short stories, every detail matters and every bit of character interaction helps in developing the characters, making them realistic and authentic. The main appeal from Aria the Animation lies in its overall message. Every episode contains a neat little adventure that almost always gives us a reason to appreciate whatever we have in life. Not just that, but the Ending song perfectly wraps the story without leaving any bitter aftertaste. Aria is not merely just an (extremely) well-done Slice-of-Life. It’s an entire experience. The city of Neo Venezia is brought to life with the help of Akari and her friends. Every character has a purpose, each and every one of them all have one unique facet to their personality that is needed for the show to thrive. It is solely dependent on its characters, and while each individual story that Aria carries around with it is certainly intriguing and required some actual thought, it’s the characters that bring this anime to the pedestal that it is now standing at. They are the reason the community praises the Aria franchise to be the truest to the Slife-of-Life genre. That is the core of Aria.\\nUnlike many other SoL’s, it does not rely on any sub-genres or anything exciting for that matter. There is nothing spectacular, nothing that makes you leap off of your couch. Due to this, when reading the premise of Aria, the show can come off as “lackluster” or “uneventful”. It’s common to think that there isn’t anything really special about Aria, that it’s wholly plain and not worth your time. But if you’re willing to embrace this show for what it is, for what it wants to offer us, the audience, that’s when you can fully understand why it’s repeatedly regarded as the best SoL to exist. Period. In Aria the Animation, you come to appreciate the little details, the tiny things that may have just been forgotten, all these little aspects that surround the anime are all connected and realised in some way. It persuades us to appreciate life, OUR lives, for what it is and what it could be. Aria inspires us to be able to reach for what we initially thought was impossible. And that was what drew me into embracing Aria and fully loving what it’s all about. I’ll be honest. It does take a while, I admit the first few episodes seem like a slow trip, you might even want to stop watching as it doesn’t look like it’ll go anywhere, but trust me. You’re about to be in for a sweet ride. The show takes its time and it does so for good reason. Every episode matters, no matter how unimportant it may seem while watching, as the show begins to come to an end, everything will fall into place and you’ll come to realise that every single element ties itself together forming a united whole.\\nAnd that’s not all. Aria doesn’t just give us compelling and wonderful characters, it goes above and beyond with its animation and soundtrack. Aria the Animation makes good use of its animation and despite it being old and outdated, it still accomplishes its purpose. Every beautiful scene is dazzling and alluring, showing that even an anime that\\'s more than ten years old can still hold up against shows such as Violet Evergarden and Koe no Katachi, known for its beautiful exterior. The same can be said about the anime’s music and sound design. The songs are attractive and easy to listen to. The sound is the backbone that supports the show and brings the emotions to its full scope. Consisting of piano melodies and string instruments, each minute of music causes Aria to be 5 times as elegant as it already is.\\nAria the Animation is an overall endearing, soothing ride that casts a net of serenity on the viewer, utilizing its animation to its full extent and incorporating a soundtrack that can only be described as perfect, with a graceful Opening and a lovely Ending that surround the show. Because of its calming nature, there’s a certain way of watching the anime for you to fully enjoy it. First, take a shower, grab a cup of coffee, and press play on your Laptop. There needs to be no distraction. Nothing else needs to be in your mind. With that, you can truly acknowledge this masterpiece. I can understand why it might be easy to dismiss Aria completely. Some people just can’t get into it no matter how much they’re persuaded. Others just don’t like Slice-of-Life. Every person’s taste is different. Anime, like all other mediums, is subjective. It’s art that can be interpreted in many ways. But if you’re a fairly new anime fan or just someone who wants to get into the genre of Slice-of-Life, then Aria the Animation is the perfect introductory piece. This anime will remain as one of my all-time favorites and I’m eager to watch the two next seasons of the franchise. To put it simply, Aria the Animation is gorgeous.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f713944c74d23cd56a8ff52d72a9a3ad'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Antithesis of the exciting effects of coffee, \"Aria\" is an anime that leads us to a peaceful dream without ever closing our eyes, tightened in the desire to be us also inhabitants of the wonderful Neo Venice and have the chance to take a few turns on a gondola, very different from those of our, although real, rather decadent (without any offense) city on the sea.\\nWe are in the year 2301, or about 150 years from the terraforming of Mars. While the Earth has been given the new name of Man-home, the red planet is now known as \"Aqua\" and hosts, among other attractions, the\\ncity of Neo-Venice, or the perfect reconstruction of the Venetian capital now submerged by the waters . It is here that the adventures of our protagonist Akari Mizunashi take place, which is committed to becoming, one day, an expert Order.\\nLike the following ones, the first series of \"Aria\" perfectly shows that weaving tragic or spectacular plots is not strictly necessary to hit and excite the spectator. A dreamy and relaxed atmosphere, the magic of everyday life and extreme simplicity are the elements that are the masters in this wonderful work and that make it a product of all respect.\\nAnother essential element of the work are the sentences and thoughts of his characters, in particular of his protagonist: they are expressed with the most genuine naturalness and come directly from the heart. In the contemplation of a place or an extraordinary event, our Akari cannot help but let itself go to simple comparisons, far from complex and sought-after scripts, and similar to poems that only children would be able to compose and that adults would never have the courage to write. The occasional sickness that could derive from it, then, is wisely damped by Aika\\'s torment \"Forbid embarrassing sentences\".\\nFirst of all, it is often pointed out how the world in which our protagonists live is an \"extraordinary miracle\": the planet Aqua, in fact, is the product of the hard work of human beings who have worked together to offer people a place pleasant and comfortable to live in. If the following series are more dedicated to exploring the streets and canals of Neo-Venice, in \"The Animation\" we often move outside the city and travel between suggestive spas, bucolic landscapes and white sand beaches. On each of these occasions, Akari cannot fail to contemplate the wonderful world that was given to her, and she will not fail to thank the people who created her and those who continue to make her existence possible.\\nAs for the adjective \"extraordinary\" I used previously, it should be pointed out that in most cases it is synonymous with \"ordinary\". Obviously it sounds like a strong contradiction, but one of the prerogatives of \"Aria\" is precisely the absence of sudden developments and striking twists. An expression that in this work would fit perfectly is, in fact, \"Happiness is in the small things\": every episode is an invitation to rejoice, to be moved, to be moved by everything that surrounds us and by the small events of each day.\\nMoving on to the characters, there is no need to dwell much. These thirteen episodes have essentially served to introduce and give us a general smattering of protagonists and supporting actors, while for a more in-depth characterization we will have to wait for the following seasons. At first glance, however, they are all very nice, each with its typical interlayer and the distinctive super-deformed face (the latter, perhaps, a little too much used).\\nThe sound sector is characterized by an excellent soundtrack. After the opening theme that directly touches the heart of the viewer (able to give even a few thrills on certain occasions) we move on to the tracks, governed by the Italian popular musical instruments and perfectly remembering the Victorian atmospheres of the real Venice, enveloping the spectator more and more with its magic. Everything is never invasive and always remains a delicate outline. To finish it all, the closing theme is taken care of, more musical and sought after in rhythms than the others but always a light and pleasant song.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f9bd057bf92992fc9cd39544860bdb05'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'After rewatching the Aria, I\\'ve decided it\\'s definately personally my favourite SoL series. I hope this review will help you decide wether Aria will be sometihng for you or not.\\nStory? Not rated, if you want to see sometihng with a deep and profound story, atleast the first two seasons are probably not what you\\'re after. Reasons why you may be interested though are: a desire relax and lose stress. Seeing little wonders or amazing things. Aria is basically a feel good anime.\\nAria is mostly about Akari, a girl from Manhome (24th century earth) going by herself to Aqua (terraformed Mars which is now mostly covered\\nby water). By the first episode she\\'s already been there for almost a year. So there\\'s no \"settling in\" and the \"story\" can start right away without any delay. Akari is training to become an undine (it\\'s not important what an undine is, but it\\'s basically someone rowing a gondola for tourism purposes). You don\\'t see her overcoming all kinds of obstacles because that\\'s not what the anime is about. Instead you see parts of her life and her adventures (with her friends) in the days passing by as she\\'s trying to become a professional.\\nThe art is pretty good. There\\'s not much to be said about this. The scenery is gorgeous. Eventhough the anime is (currently) not available in any kind of resolution near HD what you see is still amazing. There is some chibi/exaggerated facial expersions stuff going on in the series (mostly when depicting people their quirks and traits), but if you don\\'t mind it too much it should be fine.\\nThe sound is absolutely amazing. I like pretty much all voice actors (I don\\'t really like Alice\\'s VA but other than that I have no complaints. The music fits perfectly. I personally think Aria has the best soundtrack I\\'ve ever heard. I don\\'t like a cappella for example, but I can\\'t help but appriciate it when it plays. Most of the songs are soothing, calming and cheery fitting the general scenery and mood of the anime.\\nThe characters are all unique within the anime. Every person showing up has a strongly distinct personality. Though sometimes certain traits seem a bit exaggerated, their acts and decisions are all very human. Nothing seems out of place in this aspect. The diverse cast I think can make you appriciate Aria even if you don\\'t absolutely love Akari. Characters other than Akari also get plenty of screen time.\\nI also like the structure of the anime. It usually starts with a short introduction of the episode, which naturally flows into the opening (the OP gets different scenery every episode which has been made to fit the mood/story of the episode). By the time the OP fades out the it has naturally flown into the main body of the episode. It\\'s a bit hard to explain, but if you decide to watch Aria you\\'ll know what I mean.\\nThe first time I watched Aria, I did it within about 2 weeks. I really enjoyed it a lot. However after hearing multiple people saying that watching it slowly would be better I decided to rewatch the whole series 1 episode a day (before going to sleep). That is when I found out the soundtrack wasn\\'t just very good, it was in fact, amazing. It also made me appriciate every episode more.\\nI rated everything a 9, because I do think that Aria isn\\'t perfect. But the small imperfections don\\'t really matter to me as it gets compensated by being amazing as a whole.\\nTo me there\\'s no real difference between in setup or quality within the series. So what I wrote will apply to all 3 (currently finished) seasons.\\nIf you\\'re reading this there\\'s a good chance you\\'re interested and didn\\'t stop reading after the first few lines. I know I wrote amazing a lot. I did it because it amazes me how much I like Aria. I guess I could have written \"wonderful\" (suteki) instead to make it look more like Akari\\'s point of view.

Again this is a part i will have problem with staying objective because if there is a city i love it has to be venice and when\\ni found an anime that created a perfect new venice i couldnt help but love it. It has parts of being supernatural in it but it stays true to what it is about. Aqua and the beautiful world of new venecia. It gives you a feeling of wanting more no matter how far you get in it and it can bring you to a sleepy state of dreams there you are trapped into the anime and cant help but to float with it and follow the story as they tell you everything there is about this new planet aqua and its city new venecia. Granted if i want to be more objective i will honestly say that this might feel very slow for some who watches it i will be honest there but for those who appreciate a story telling through and anime like this its capturing.\\nAgain art isnt what im good at but for me it was a nice fit for the anime with a good original feel to it.\\nThe sound was another thing that gave the story life of its own. Granted it might make you sleeping and relaxed too much which might be a bad thing but it also throws you into a sleeping feel there you just want to listen to the soundtrack as the anime floats by.\\nEvery character has something to offer they tell the story of each of the more central characters in its own time. Though Akari will stay a mystery in a way you will still love the characters with their own personal beliefs and stories. Again this anime follow what some might call my pace but that is something i hope those who watch this anime will realise and enjoy to the fullest.

There were times i even shed a tear or two because the feels you get from the characters story and music can wring your heart yet give you a laugh or two.\\nSo overall i want to call it a masterpiece eventhough an objective side of me is trying to tell me otherwise i cant really help but loving every part of this great anime.  10/10 Because beautiful and calm anime like this is the rarest out there and this captures that.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'be7e3bb48b7b352cd170495b7230e978'}>,\n",

There is little that goes on in this first season besides the odd jobs that the Aria company picks up and the daily adventures that Alice, Aika, and Akari each undines(female gondoliers) in training one day hoping to become a Prima Undine (a professional gondolier) go on. The world of Neo Venezia where they live is a peaceful and wondrous city that shares many similarities to Venice combined with a warm beach front. There isn’t many serious conflicts in the show, and very little progression to speak of, but it\\ndoes fantastic show to unwind, and refresh yourself with. The show easily can put me to sleep (in a good way), with its nice and inviting atmosphere and beautiful music. The OP’s slow and galavanting pace makes the gradual vocal crescendo oh so satisfying, and the ending is just a cheery little number that leaves a smile on any viewer's face without fail. The characters are all hardworking and nice people, though a bit one dimensional so far. The repeated use of  jokes and sayings quite often like: “Embarrassing remarks are not allowed!”, “my my”, etc help to establish all the different characters and help to show off their individual personalities, and are cool for a while, and I’m glad that they never really drive any of them into the ground. I wonder why every single female undine’s name starts with an A, it can make it really difficult to remember which name goes to which face. Also the presidents being cats is a bit ridiculous though I’m not sure if they actually have any managerial duties, or are instead just figureheads or mascots for the companies. Neo Venezia is an idealized utopia, explored though these cheerful young Undines in training.

The story seems to fit in with lighter fare comparable to that of Someday's Dreamers, but it does pick up and adds an interesting sci-fi twist to the world the characters reside. And though the stories have a little trouble flowing from episode to episode, the fluffy narration helps guide the viewer to the themes of both the individual episode and the overall series.\\nAnimation- 8\\nThe art style is plain, but crisp, effervescent, and\\nexpressive. The direction very decisively uses wonderful pans and panoramas to give a unique sense of scope to Aqua. The water glitters with radiance, and there is a milky smoothness to the gondaliers' rowing.

The score to Aria the Animation has a wonderful authentic Italian feel to it. The opening and ending themes are deliberate and flow easily into and out of the show.

Wow so much italian sentence happen in this episode, i learnt so much too, good for me. Its good attach for the series, comparing to other boring episode happen in the late half episodes. Except this and previous, i like both of them. Unfortunately indeed, this type of series that prioritizes soothing visualization, is full of boring things happen. Not my typical show to watch, but personally i dont have much complain about that. I rather say, all of that, well enough to say good, nor be my best show\\ni ever seen.\\nNice scenes with Ai-cwan in the end, tho. She appear as a beginning start from second episode till 12s. So, when she comeback, im surprised like Akari, lol! Thats surprising moment really get my judgement alert to the upper level. Im happy, all of that OST really balancing the relaxation paces. Ofc, so much previous scenes better performing relaxation and a melancholy event. But, in this end, i appreciate much.\\nTheir union too, very good! Their happiness too, increasing my mood! And ofc, for the baby Aqua! Well, Ai really get what she deserve about Aqua terraforming, just change your home, please, and reunion with Akari at once!

This is for your stress medicines. This is for your healthy life. Thats all, which is somehow, a bit far of my original expectation.\\nThis show somehow late its peak momentum. So much loss desire happen, just increasing my boredom level to the lowest, like some part at the island, Arias president story, or in Grandma village. Sort of lame approach for me to filled the episode. But, whatever, im glad the end fitted like that. Its my most highly appreciate point for this show at this rate.\\nWith how slow its pacing, tho, i won't wish too much. Its average attempt, imo. And i know the studio really work hard to filled all the detail only for the first 13 episodes. Season is over, now. And im trying hard to push myself on to other season. What will happen to Akari and her lifes in the Aqua? Lets see the story moving forward. But for me, Aria season 1 is good. No other comment itching myself, rather than that. 7 points for the story.\\nBesides the ending, and Ai perform contribution, i may like how the music and sound buzzing through this first series. This show really mark at my mind as a therapy for mental illness. Its very good to make your mind clear, just enjoying the music, and watch a beautiful Aqua Neo-Venezia City vistas. And im pretty sure, you will get your healthy again as soon as possible. Thats my 9 point there, thats was added to Art section too, i guess?\\nNot much mentioning how the characterization goin on here. There is so much miss detail explanations. While the scenes on the Time Travel aspect screwing up a bit to the past of some character. Like in the episodes of 12, i see Aika and Akira? The hell is that? No explanations. Just random without any good reason, because you wanna thing it just for fun? This is SciFi remember? At least give me more explain how their reaction first for showing their development. But, no, its get abandon. Like any other parts, feel like blurred to me.\\nOfc, this is only for season 1, but i dont get well with that pacing. Too slow for me! Thats it my complain for development character sections. Even Akari had a little contribution, here, since her spot just to explain how Aqua world-building start from first till the last. Im laughing at that point. This show really had some hidden meaning to solve of its problem. Their reaction? Their mimics? Their conversation sounds? Its up to you, for completing the development of the character. For me, it just a bad approach to satisfy my curiosity. With that, 7 points shall be enough for my respect toward Aqua colonialization.\\nAt the last, my enjoyment will be the average, referring so much problem happen at the entire level of the series. I happy, ofc. I feel the joy, ofc. I get the relaxation moment, ofc. I know some hidden meaning appear at some scenes, no kidding. But, its ways of telling to people newbie like me, its a worst part. Glady your music and Ai, baby Aqua cuteness save the day from being miserable punishment. Then, i hope it get better at the next season. Just, my normal hope, not too high for this kind of series.

Today, Aqua is covered in water and the city built on it, Neo Venezia, is built much like it's Earth counterpart, with canals and waterways\\nthroughout the city. Our main character, Akari, is a relatively new undine. The majority of the anime focuses on her interactions with the other undines, tourists, and discovering more about the beautiful planet she now inhabits.\\nThe art is beautiful and endearing for it's time.

A focus on architecture and beautiful landscapes make Aria a pleasant watch.\\nThe soundtrack is hands down one of the most beautiful things I have ever listened to and it's no surprise that the CDs for the soundtracks are sought after and sold at premium prices.\\nThe OP makes use of odd intervallic relationships between the leading voice and piano accompaniment along with the steady and slow swelling strings in the background to lull you into the dreamlike state that permeates the series.\\nThe characters aren't over the top or outstanding in typical anime fashion. i Each of them have their quirks, yes, but these quirks are not the defining traits of the characters and their interactions feel much more grounded in reality throughout the series because of their nuanced behavior.\\nI love this series, and you probably don't need me urging you to watch it to be intrigued by the concept in an industry dominated by stories that are far too often too similar and characters that are far too often recycled.\\nI believe the only people who wouldn't enjoy Aria are people that solely watch anime for action or nihilists.

The artwork is nice and it the manga does go more in-depth story-wise. However, I'd recommend watching the anime ONLY for the wondrous harmony of audio and visuals. No other anime have approached audio and visuals the way this had. Not then, not even now. That's because of the genius storyboarding: these writers knew EXACTLY what to do and they've done it fucking well.\\nI rarely give out nines and tens to anime and manga series, but this one gets a clear 9.5 out of 10. It is a beautiful anime. Every episode will warm your heart and tug on your heartstrings. It is the anime that you most likely draw some connection to. The tempo is slow and the pacing laid-back. But this is a design-choice. The producers WANTED this to happen due to the inherent nature of the story. As all of you should know by now, the anime adaptation should appropriate the manga. It's synchronous ability to do just that is sublime.\\nWatch it! If you're not watching anything else right now, watch Aria. If you're watching something else right now, drop that shit and watch Aria instead. Nah, I kid! Finish that first and then watch the anime.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8b849b6173e7f8af05678eeb404222f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Aria the Animation\\nLength: 13 Episodes\\nRating: 7.5/10\\nGenre: Slice of Life, Comedy\\nPlot: come and observe the life of Akari, an undine working for the Aria Company in Neo Venezia, on the planet aqua. Aqua is what&rsquo;s formerly known as Mars, after humans managed to pull up water from the surface and make the planet one that of water. Earth, known as Man-Home, has become an almost impossible place to live.\\nAkari came to Aqua a year and a half ago and started working as an undine, or someone who steers gondolas. Join her as the makes new friends and learns more about Aqua. That&rsquo;s really it. It&rsquo;s the\\nultimate slice of life anime. There&rsquo;s no suspenseful plot, you watch it to observe the lives of those in it.\\nSo that you don&rsquo;t get confused by what&rsquo;s going on sometimes, I&rsquo;ll explain a bit about Aqua.\\nThere are four key jobs that are essential to Aqua. They are the Undines, Sylphs, Moles, and Salamanders. Undines are responsible for piloting gondolas, and there are three main companies &ndash; Aria Company, Himeya, and Orange Planet. They transport many people from place to place, and also serve a s a major source of tourist income. There are three levels to being an undine &ndash; the two apprentice levels, which are Pair and Single, and Primas, who are the professionals. You can differentiate between the ranks by the gloves on their hands &ndash; a pair has two gloves, a single one, and a prima none. It is the want of all Pairs and Singles to become a Prima, because they can then take around customers on their own and mentor other pairs and singles.\\nSylphs are the package deliverers. While there still is a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; mail system, most of the mail is done through the sylphs, who ride around on hover-bikes transporting the goods.\\nMoles and Salamanders make Aqua inhabitable however. Moles live underground, and they control the planet&rsquo;s gravity. Its very important to do so, because the strength of gravity is about 1/3 that of earth, which would make things very uncomfortable for humans to live on. Salamanders all live in the sky, in a hovering system known as Wikijima. They are responsible for controlling Aqua&rsquo;s climate, and making it habitable. The reason that they are called salamanders is that Mars&rsquo; nature by default is to be very cold &ndash; therefore, the salamanders main job is to make sure that there is enough heat in the atmosphere to survive. That being said, there are still the four traditional seasons.\\nAnalysis- Contrary to what you might think, its actually a good anime. When I first heard of it, I thought &lsquo;this is going to be really stupid. It&rsquo;s a show about gondolas for crying out loud.&rsquo; after being prodded by a friend, I decided to watch it.\\nWhats great about this anime is that, as I said before, it truly is a slice of life anime. Its very calming to watch this and become immersed in the characters lives. The characters are instantly lovable, and each have distinct personalities just like many people in the real world have, not just the cookie cutter personalities that you find in many anime and manga. These characters are all real people. I think that that is what make this anime so great.\\nMy only downside to it is that it is slow paced. Because theres no plot from episode to episode, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of suspense contained there. Sometimes it was a force of will to watch them when I was bored, when I could have gone for something with a little more action. This anime you probably should watch when you&rsquo;re content with everything and you&rsquo;re not just watching anime because you&rsquo;re bored and have nothing else to do.\\nCharacters:\\nAkari: She is a very loving girl, and also very innocent. She takes everything sentimentally, and feels obligated to help others at most chances. However, she is prone to panic if something starts to go wrong. She is a single for the Aria Company.\\nTrademark Phrase: Ehh??\\nAika: Heir to Himeya she takes everything seriously. She isn't one for touchy-touchy feelings, but if theres someone that she really likes, then she becomes pseudo-obsessive. She treats everything as though it were a contest, and as such mimics her instructor, Akira. She has a crush on Alicia She is a single for Himeya.\\nTrademark Phrase: Hazukashi serufu kinshi! [Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!]\\nAlice: A prodigy undine at Orange Planet, she is a na&iuml;ve, closed off girl. She treats everything apathetically, and first time that we see her, she doesn't know how to smile. Because she is a prodigy, she was treated differently by the girls in her school class. She is the only pair of the group, yet she is as talented.\\nTrademark Phrase: adding Dekkai to everything [which means something along the lines of big, extreme, very]\\nTheir mentors are the Three Water Fairies, or those who are said to be the greatest undines that are currently working.\\nAlicia: She is a very light natured girl, much like Akari. She loves people, and she never sees the bad side to anyone. She's best at her social skills, and as such is much wanted by the tourists. She is a prima for the Aria Company\\nTrademark Phrase: Ara Ara, *giggle [Ara means My, so she's saying My My]\\nAkari: Much like her apprentice, she deals with everything seriously. However, beneath it all, she's really nice &ndash; the rough exterior is her way of trying to properly train whoever is underneath her. However, even with that, she still has a mean streak, which is apparent whenever someone insults her, however jokingly she meant it. She's best at controlling the gondola out of anyone. She is a prima for Himeya.\\nTrademark Phrase: Unfortunately, I can't find one.\\nAthena: She is a big ditz head. She is clumsy, silent, and prone to making mistakes. However, she is remarkably perceptive, and helps usually from the shadows. She doesn't make much of an appearance, so I can't say much more. Her best skill is that of canzone, or singing [which, is quite frankly, quite amazing]\\nTrademark Phrase: Again, can't find one.\\nOther Characters\\nAi: A little girl from Man-Home, she became friends with Aria in the first episode, after which they became pen pals. Every episode starts off with a conversation between the two, which foreshadows/concludes the episode in some way or another. In the two episodes that she appears in person, I really don't like her. I can't really explain why though.\\nNow, before you all yell at me for this next part, let me explain. On Aqua, blue eyed cats are considered to be lucky, for they embody the water goddess. Because of that, all gondola companies have a blue eyed cat as their president.\\nAria: A big, fat, Martian cat, he is my favorite character. He can understand human speech, and loves having fun. He is curious, as all cats are, and he likes to help out other people.\\nTrademark Phrase: Pyun nyan nyan nya! [Ok, its basically the only thing he says. He's a cat. But i love his voice].\\nHime: A Persian cat [I think], like her name suggests, she has a very regal manner to her [Hime means Princess in Japanese]. She is president of Himeya.\\nMaa: A ... weird ... cat ... who loves to bite Aria's stomach. He is president of Orange Company.\\nMusic: The music in this anime is very calm, very relaxing. Something thats unique is that there is no opening sequence - rather, the song is played in the background while we watch the characters do stuff.\\nreview taken from animeruwelz, check out my profile for more details\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7345634b7134d89db3729853218d5f6f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Story:  The story is for people who enjoy slower pace and marvelous execution. Like Mushishi, the plot follows a protagonist on a journey, in this case to see Akari's dream of becoming an Prima Undine (gondelier). It's goal is like a treasure hunt designed to introduce us to all the special things about Neo-Venezia and the people who inhabit Aqua (Mars). Everything from the sound and character design to the art style revolves around this world. Meandering from place to place, while giving me a place to explore along with the characters and get to know the neighborhoods and people who live there.\\nArt:\\nThe art for ARIA is quite wonderful. Everything really fits the mood of the story and the music and let's us see the world as the characters do. The art direction, and even some of the angles used were particularly interesting to me (such as the scene in the glass shop - it seemed like the director wanted to say that the couple wasn't seeing the whole picture, or Neo-Venezia for what it was). I was also especially impressed by how well the characters mouths are synched with the sound. Everything from the shouting to the singing is right on track (which you really don't get in many anime).\\nI think the elements are what are portrayed particularly nicely - the water, the night sky, a sunset, a field... it shows just how important this world is to the people who live there. The water is essential and much of the series is dedicated to honouring it.\\nSound: Definitely a 10! The music MADE this show for me. I had the good fortune to begin watching the show very late at night and it became a kind of nightly ritual for me, because although it is still a wonderful series in the daytime, there is something so soothing and a little sleepy about the music - a very dreamy quality that makes me completely unproductive if I watched for too long. It was like watching a quiet storm from a large window or being lulled by waves. You just felt a little lethargic afterwards. I still hear it as I fall asleep or sing Athena's songs to myself.\\nCharacters: The characters in the show are great! You really get to know them well and they begin to feel like old friends very quickly. I thought it was interesting seeing the world through the point of view of Akari, a transplanted native, her friends, actual native, and Ai, a visitor from Manhome that Akari befriends. It made for an interesting juxtaposition of perspectives.\\nMy only (very slight) selfish complaint is we don't learn enough about some of their backgrounds. They are driven by behavior, so we do learn some things, but I'm nosy and love to really get to know my current series' characters well. I am never satisified until I learn what drives their behaviors. In this series, however I found that it wasn't really necessary, so I feel like I was able to know most of them adequately. Would have been nice to learn more about Al though.\\nMy overall enjoyment of the series was definitely Outstanding. I didn't expect to get nearly as much depth as I did or care for the characters and AQUA as I do.\\nThe thing that really struck me about ARIA was how much I had learned about its world once I had finished the series. I knew about people's daily lives, their background, its traditions and annual festivals. I got to know the inner workings of how some of the tourism, trades and industry and how people made their livings (including the mail service!). By the end, I even knew some of the locals by name and some of the things that were important or special to them, which is pretty rare and wonderful in a 2-demensional animated world. The world of AQUA and Aria is like a treasure that you keep warm and safe inside you, whether you spend that time alone or share it with others.\\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated! ^_^\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '132f210e20e5cb020aac8126fddd392a'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'When i first thought about watching the Aria series I was amazed to see how many episodes overall the series has including the 2nd and 3rd season. So this made me wonder was this a series that doesn\\'t want to die or is this show just that good that episode count doesn\\'t matter. Well after having finished the whole series I can say that this is a slice of life series that deserves the time it takes to build the characters and make us never want to leave Neo-Venezia and the planet of Aqua.\\nA quick description of the series, we are following Akari Mizunashi who\\ndecides to move from Earth to the terraformed planet of Aqua (formerly Mars) where she plans to train on becoming undine in the city of Neo-Venezia, a city of canals modeled after Venice, Italy. She is an apprentice at the Aria company, which is the small 2 person company. As the series progresses we meet many characters and learn about this incredible world of Aqua.\\nProbably the biggest compliment I can pay to this series is that it makes the viewer to live in this city of canals and experience the little things in life that sometimes are taken for granted since we are moving too fast, this series slows us down and gives a relaxed view of something you\\'ve never experienced. Also the animes\\' director went on location to Venice to get true replicated designs of the canals and historic buildings which are replicated in Neo-Venezia.\\nAkari of course is our bright-eyed rookie who is happy to be living her dream and growing up as the series moves on. The rest of the characters are good, I won\\'t go into detail because part of the enjoyment for the show is learning each of the characters\\' personalities and motivations.\\nAlso important to note, since this is a slice of life series there is no action/battles/super powers/ etc. There is some small magical/mystery elements but that is not related to the main characters and more to do with the city of Neo-Venezia itself. So the adrenaline junkies might want to move on to something else. But this series is pure \"feel good\" from the opening song to the closing song everything is orchestrated perfectly to make you happy and at times sad that you can never go to Aqua yourself.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b5ef5600b5868e07b55fcc82f5d0c435'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'This is probably the first series I’ve ever watched that seriously sucks all the energy out of you (in a good way, mind you). Aria is just so calm and soothing, that you can’t help but feel relaxed afterwards. Because of this tendency, though, this series also took me very long to complete, mainly because of me struggling against the forces of sleepiness (x.x). The calming atmosphere to this series is truly unique, which is probably why Aria has such a great reputation amongst those who like Kuuki-kei “atmosphere”/slice-of-life anime.\\nThe story takes place on former planet Mars, which is now called Aqua in this series.\\nAqua is a terraformed Mars, which in itself is quite a unique setting. For those that don’t know what terraforming is, terraforming would be where a normally uninhabitable planet (without water, like Mars) is artificially made habitable by adding plants, water, and other basic necessities. This series is great at portraying the city of Neo Venezia, which is made into a truly charming and diverse setting. The scenery is great, with the all-encompassing presence of water reminiscent of the Italian city of Venice. Perhaps it’s that large presence of water that makes the setting feel so calm and peaceful, and personifies this series perfectly.\\nThe most notable part to this show is definitely the characters; the characters are so goofy, yet have a nice charm to everything they do. The dialogue between all the characters feels strangely natural, which makes this show both easy to follow, as well as fun to watch. The everyday interactions between all the characters, such as our main character Akari or the company mascot President Aria, are quite innocent yet endearing. The characters’ every day lives aren’t exactly eventful, yet at the same time, are thought provoking and philosophical at times, which sends a often endearing message through it’s characters. Sometimes the characters fit into more generic stereotypes found in anime, but that doesn’t stop the main cast from being fun to watch. The characters are well thought out, and their interactions with their surroundings really produces some genuinely great stories.\\nAn oddity to this show would be how each episode’s plot is almost completely disconnected with each other. I sometimes found myself clicking ahead one or two episodes by accident, only to realize I actually skipped some episodes later on. Since there is no solid continuing plot, it’s very difficult to get a concrete linear storyline set in mind. I will admit that there are benefits to the disconnected story format, which allows for the introduction of more side characters and some very unique plots, so I guess it all depends on if you feel the format benefits the overall impressions of the show.\\nThe music, and the sounds of the waves, really helps complement the soothing atmosphere to this show. Production quality wise, the animation is consistent most of the time, but the actual contents of each episode is great to see, with plenty of beautiful scenic panoramic shots throughout the show. There are many who will argue that the plot is too slow and boring, but that’s pretty much all dependent on what you expect from this show. If you’re expecting some sort of action packed, dramatic tear inducing show, Aria is definitely not for you. However, if you don’t mind trying out new types of anime, and could appreciate a more slow paced, well developed yet extremely calming and charming anime, Aria might just be for you.\\nProduction Quality: 8.0/10\\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\nStory: 8.5/10\\nSetting: 8.0/10\\nOverall Score: 8.3/10 (rounded down to a 8 on MAL)\\nFeedback and comments is always appreciated.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6f8103efe664697af46ce3f2f03d6d28'}>,\n",

I watched just recently so can\\'t really refrain from judging with modern standards.\\nThe animation is quite good it helps you\\nfeel the movement of the scenery, the chibi part is also likeable since every charachter has a different \"face\" that later becomes a further charachterization of them.\\nSound: 10/10\\nWell, were to start? The opening...\\nThe first episodes the opening was just a fine tune, but when i started to \"Understand\" how the anime worked, it became something more, something important.\\nI would easily say that the best part in the anime is the opening, watching a young lady rowing the boat in the vastness of the sea is just... perfect.\\nTroughout the show the musics where on point, never stressfull tough (which is the point of the anime, it helps you to relax, not to get stressed).\\nThe ending is quite nice aswell, i usually skip both openings and endings but for this show i had very good reasons to not do so.\\nIn short the sound is just incredibly good.\\nCharachters: 7/10\\nThe charachters are just nice, i would not say that those are good or the core of the anime ( that is the sound ), i would also not say that the charachters were an issue for this anime.

But as we all know SoL Show are have their own special time you need to watch them.\\nI will start with the sounds, which are absolutely magnificent and relaxing ones soul. The lyrics of the songs(Op,Ed,OST) are original and related to the show. Which further invite \\'us\\' the viewers to relate to the show and characters in particular.An amazing job from sounds part! IT was relieving and heart warming.\\nContinuing to the characters. As more SoL Shows depend on easily relatable\\ncharacters so that the viewer can get easily absorbed. Same goes to Aria. The characters are well introduced each with its own traits and weaknesses and each of them influence the others with their unique actions. All together making a great and relaxing company.\\nAs far as Story is concerned , its pretty simple. We follow the protagonist in her daily Life and learn via her experiences valuable life lessons. You also can say that the show has some pretty serious teachings to deliver but also most of them are widely knows. (was at least for me)\\nProbably one of the most Heart warming, relaxing,relatable shows out there. It awakes wide feelings within the viewer. Mostly it tries to appeal to the innocence we all had at some point in our life but we lost it. (Tho it is terribly stupid at some points.)Also the comedy is what i would call mediocre. It is good if you love the characters and its enough to help you maintain a constant grin on your face. But not what you would call hilarious or asphyxiating. Also most of the gags are recycled sadly.Personally I didn\\'t love it much, or laughed.But it did suffice!\\nThe visuals and animations is oke. Fitting its theme very well but personally but it definitely had some pretty weird CG from time to time. You cannot say it was ugly but you can say not entirely attractive.\\n----------------------------------Personal opinion and weak points----------------------------------------\\nIf you don\\'t get absorbed into it, there is no chance to like this and some serious problems are created. Personally i found it lacking proper physics and common logic (but that\\'s one of the minor problems). Also there it has some metaphors that i found out of place and the only reason to be there is to add some deep meaning and confuse the viewer.Example,\"Become one with the wind.\",\"I want to deliver my heart to you\",\"Sky full of lead colored clouds=clouded sky\", \"those silver angels will...=snow\" etc. Another thing, is that it used \\'Engrish\\' as humour... Worst kind of Japanese comedy ever made imo.I also did a mistake... i watched it one go!... Which slowly started to feel completely bored of it at some points. (I gotta blame myself for it) but it also didn\\'t have any certain goal so as to keep me attached. So we can say its not so attractive you must watch it out of your own volution.BUT 1 major thing i found sad. There are Lots of random stuff trying to add something intriguing stagnant into the show and confuse the plot. Also adding depth...wait..what plot?For example,Wind blowing,Shining Sea,Shining Rows,Weoponized Lens Flare Sun angles.There is a Ski-fi tag but there is no explanation to several obscure phenomena ...(time travel). Last but not least,Unless you are autistic or have some sort of serious mental illness reacting to everything with INTERJECTIONS is something bad other than cute,relaxing and comfortable.\\nDespite my salt opinion as long as you get absorbed this is absolutely relaxing and it will offer you a really pleasant feeling.But its really boring if you feel detached no matter how relaxing,calming overwhelming you with happiness, enjoyment it offers.4 hours warm spent.\\nReasons to watch it:\\n-Anime is quoting about life and it does it good.\\n-Unique feelings of happiness.\\n-Only likable characters.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bb8eb175e71bf40d05f95463d5799e22'}>,\n",

A slice of life series, the pacing is rather slow as compared to modern Animes. But hey, sometimes you just have to take it slow and chillax. Just let the Anime teach how to appreciate all the little things in life.\\nArt: 10/10 Art is amazing, this Anime is made way back in 2005, you cannot expect the same level of standard as of today, but the environment, characters and cats are welly drawn and comfortable to look at. Landmarks are distinguishing, a very warm\\nstyle of art I would say. Feels cozy as I think back.\\nSound: 10/10 The sound is astonishing. It suits the atmosphere of the Anime perfectly. 1 thing they did very well is to have a different opening scene every episode, so I pretty much listened to \"Undine\" (opening of anime) 12 times, the song sorta grew on me. Ending(Rainbow) gives off a very cozy feeling, lyrics fits the Anime really well. The OST in the Anime is marvelous as well, all of them give you a calming feeling, like lullaby. Brings wonders to my ears, they are also superb for studying or when writing a Aria review!\\nCharacter: 9/10 I do not believe a character has to change to be a good character, in the series there are little character development, however, all the character are distinct from one another and are unique in their own rights. Most importantly, they are lovable. They pretty much remain the same throughout the series, but learning the backstory of some of the characters intrigues me.\\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Did not finish the whole Anime in one sitting like I usually do. Took me a few days, but everyday I find myself wanting to watch 1 or 2 episodes of Aria, the Anime does not bomb rush you with plot, each episode tells a different excellent story, there is no cliffhanger, perhaps that is why I could not finish the Anime in 1 sitting. But unique idea, the characters, the music and the cats gave me a blast. This Anime is certainly one of the kind. An Anime that tells you simple, warm stories. I would not say that the Anime is deep, anyone can pretty much understand what is going on with just one watch. But the simplicity fits the Anime very well, I mean, it is to take us through all the little things in life.\\nOverall: 9/10 I would say the Anime has outdone itself, I always disliked slow pacing Anime, but miraculously I finished this Anime, I do not think I will watch the sequel due to how long an episode is but I will definitely finish the Manga, which the Anime is based on. However, I would recommend this Anime to anyone, if you like watching Anime as compared to reading the Manga, please do check out the sequel, as I heard they are tear-jerking! However, the Anime got an 9 from me, is because the Orange Planet\\'s cat looks weird. I like cute cats that are nice to other cats.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd32fa27c2f0fff552e0f3e233d3cb92b'}>,\n",

Main cast, their senpais and eventually their kohais. Main cast consists of very cheerful and happy girl, with soothing senpai. A quiet and odd girl who was my favorite and her clumsy and weird senpai.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Sailor Moon is one of those franchises that you're almost certainly familiar with. It has five anime series with a sixth currently airing. I already looked at the first series, which was great if you watched the original and terrible if you watched the heavily censored Eglish dub. It also has a live action series, over a dozen video games, a musical version and a trio of anime films. Today, we'll be looking at the first of them. Sailor Moon R: The Movie.\\nStory:\\nWe open with the sailor soldiers going to a greenhouse/ garden to look at flowers. Everything seems to be going well\\nand laughter is in abundance. That's when a strange guy approaches Mamoru and takes his hand in a very suggestive fashion while telling him that he's brought a flower like he promised. Usagi notices and tells him that Mamoru is her boyfriend. He responds by pushing her away, shifting appearance to look very similar to Ail and Ann & teleporting away with a flowery effect. But he vows to bring Mamoru lots of flowers. Mamoru mentions the name “Fiore” and goes off on his own. Leaving the soldiers to contemplate what it all means and Usagi to try to deal with her boyfriend's probable bisexuality. Although she really has no room to judge given that she's attracted to at least three other women over the course of the anime.\\nNow, I actually do like that they use their words and try to reason with the antagonist rather than just going into a long fight scene. I also do like that they make Fiore sympathetic, which is pretty common for Sailor Moon villains, instead of evil for the evils. The film also has some good comedic moments, some with Chibi-Usa, although I only begrudgingly admit that I liked some of her scenes. I also like that the film's story is self-contained, giving you enough information that you can easily understand it even if you haven't seen the series leading up to it. The film's major narrative flaw is the ending. A lot of the stuff leading up to it is good, but it moves into an obvious fake out scene with a cheap resolution. Now, it really needed a little time after that scene to wrap things up properly. Instead, the movie just ends abruptly. It feels like they couldn't think of a good way to wrap things up and just decided not to bother.\\nCharacters:\\nThe sailor soldiers remain fun, entertaining and interesting characters. Some of the best scenes in the film involve the five of them just having fun or explore their bonds with each other. Fiore is also a great character and I did, overall, like what they did with his story arc. The weak links are Chibi-Usa, who gets some funny scenes but is still a pretty annoying character, and Mamoru, who is just as bland and generically good as he's always been. The difference is that in the series he stayed largely on the sidelines as a secondary character and in this film he's one of the major focus characters. It does make his dullness more noticeable.\\nArt:\\nThe art is good. The character designs look as nice as ever. The action sequences flow better than they do in most of the series with some of the stock attack animations being replaced by more active scenes, although there are certainly plenty of the stock animations present. The backgrounds are lively and nicely detailed, certainly moreso than was present in the first series at least.\\nSound:\\nThe vocal cast is superb, as it is in the main series. Mitsuishi Kotono, Hisakawa Aya, Tomizawa Michie, Shinohara Emi and Fukami Rica are joined by Touma Yumi as the Kisenian flower and Midorikawa Hikaru as Fiore. Sailor Moon fans may recognise them as the same duo who played Ail and Ann in R. Which is a little confusing given that the film's story really has nothing to do with the main R storyline in spite of the title. Still, they all give great performances. The music is really good. Sure, some of it is recycled from the series but it was good music then and it's still just as good.\\nHo-yay:\\nGiven that the plot revolves on another man with an obvious crush on Mamoru and that Mamoru does respond to his feelings pretty favorably in spite of Fiore's feelings being arguably one-sided, I'm going to give it a ho-yay factor of a 5/10.\\nFinal Thoughts:\\nSailor Moon R: The Movie does have a lot to recommend it. The characters, aside from a certain two, are really good. The story itself is compelling and features a lot of good moments. The voice acting and music are great. It's not a great film, however. It suffers from a weak ending. It feels incomplete. One of the focus characters is Generic Male Love Interest #403. If you're a fan of the Sailor Moon franchise and you haven't seen it, check it out. You'll probably like it okay, at the very least. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Tomorrow, a film from a different famous Toei animation franchise. Yes, this one is probably the first one you thought of.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '520a0a980ad12d01d1a790e0584102da'}>,\n",

This is one movie that many fans who hated the American dub, at times agree that the movie was dubbed great in contrast. The voices of both the original and dub were convincing, and the ending song was the best song I heard in Sailor Moon.

I can't speak for the other movies in this franchise, but this one certainly was.\\nThe basic plot element, in one word, would be 'nostalgia.' Keeping spoilers to the minimum, the movie is about the circumstances that'd arise if adults were suddenly provided with the golden age of their childhood, the period they were brought up\\nin, cheerful and gloomy moments alike, and the opportunity to live in it forever; and how our main cast struggles their way through it to earn their anticipated outcome.\\nDespite the seriousness of the plot, the film is thoroughly light-hearted and comical, as in accordance with the minimalistic art-style that keeps it apart from the rest of the medium as well as the misadventures of our eternally young 5 year old protagonist and his friends. That's why even the bus-chase that is over 10 minutes long, or the pointless acrobatics above the Tokyo tower never feels overbearing but makes the emotional moments even more captivating. The movie also doesn't miss out on inserting some social commentaries in between, which are gleefully lost among the puns and parodies. The story has a villain, or two to be precise, but they're portrayed as justice against justice rather than evil, and are on the softer side when it comes to implementation of violence to achieve their means, which gives them that humane touch that prototypical villains lack.\\nAs already mentioned, the art is crude, as is the comedy, but it perfectly contributes to the overall feel of it. And it'd be a real shame to skip this one based on preference of visuals alone. Because here is something that has the colour of a sunset, joyously defies serious scrutiny should one even attempt it, and at the same time is culturally profound from a Japanese point of view, from the very first mahou-shoujo anime televised, right down to Taro Okamoto's avant-garde art and an escapist society of the early 21st century.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '328e1243d91d7e10990af9df1f8ef1a4'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Every year, my friend and I go to our local cinema to watch the latest instalment of the Detective Conan franchise. We’ve been doing this since 2014, going through the movies whether good or bad.\\nI entered the cinema with fingers crossed and hoped for the best. After the disaster that was the 20th movie I was cautiously optimistic about this one, and while a small part of me was reluctant to watch it, the squealing fan-girl within me pushed me to give it a chance.\\nAnd so fast forward several days later – I can still recall the utter relief that rushed through me\\nwhen I finished watching The Crimson Love Letter. I left the cinema with an excited smile on my face, mind whirling with thoughts and opinions to prepare for this review. It’s a little depressing to be happy just because the movie didn’t suck, but eh. We’ll just have to wait and see if the movie 22 turns out to be good, so that the spike of dread at each new Detective Conan movie will finally cease.\\n[Story: 8/10]\\nThe case this time is simple and straightforward, no closed room murder or intricate murder mystery for the viewer to unravel. I think it’s a good thing because instead of getting a complicated mess of a story what we got instead was a simple and solid mystery. The whodunit didn’t become clear to me until they were revealed but more astute watchers might guess who it might be if the manage to piece together the evidence quicker than I could.\\nThe Crimson Love Letter not only gives us a good mystery, it also provides a generous dollop of competitive Karuta – something some anime fans might be familiar with if they watch or read Chihayafuru. Basically, it’s a sport wherein players have to ‘steal’ cards from their opponent’s territory, a one-on-one battle to see who gets the card first. It requires a fast-reflexes and an intimate knowledge of the poems written on the cards, and the first player to get rid of all their cards, win.\\nA deep understanding of Karuta isn’t necessary but you would enjoy the Karuta battles more if you did, I suppose. The movie does a good job of tying it in with the main plot and character motivations, so I was slightly impressed by that. The inclusion of Heji and Kazuha also served to spice up the regular mystery formula due to the fact Heji’s childhood friend has a role to play in the story as well. Overall, I think the plot was well-paced and kept my interest for the entire runtime.\\n[Characters: 7/10]\\nHattori Heji and Tomoya Kazuha stage an epic return in this movie. I really missed them as it’s been quite a while since they appeared in both the manga and the anime, and as I watched Conan and Hattori bicker like old pals I felt indescribably happy at such a familiar scene.\\nIn contrast to Conan’s rational and sometimes cold personality, Hattori’s hot headedness provides a nice change. He spices up boring exposition scenes and makes the regular doom and gloom of searching for the murderer more enjoyable, and his ‘will they or will they not’ relationship with Kazuha makes The Crimson Love Letter more energetic and humorous. There were many scenes throughout the movie where the chemistry between the two childhood friends were downright intense – you can literally see their affection for each other through every action and remark.\\nThis causes the appearance of the movie’s new character, Ooka Momiji, to have a bigger effect, one of the side plots being that she is ‘engaged’ to Heji due to a childhood promise. This was another aspect of The Crimson Letter that I really liked as it gave the movie a lot more personality, rather than going through the usual tired detective mystery and eventual capture of the suspect.\\nIn many ways, the characters here felt more genuine than those in the last few movies.\\n[Animation: 8/10]\\nEditing was on point for this movie, and the creative use of panels from the manga to convey flashbacks was a very nice touch, and honestly, damn impressive. They really stepped up the game for this movie. The animation was consistent with several standout moments, like one scene where Kazuha and Momiji admire their surroundings from a boat. Overall, I have nothing but praise for the animation.\\n[Conclusion: 8/10]\\nThe Crimson Love Letter may not be a return to form, but it does a fine job of reminding fans of why they're in love with Detective Conan. A well written mystery with entertaining characters and impressive animation, you can’t go wrong with this one. Take it from someone who hated the last movie, The Darkest Nightmare.

But alas, that day will have to wait as Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter struggles to keep its audience engaged and ends up becoming a very hard to follow film.\\nAs one will know from the summary alone, the film centers on Kazuha competing for Heiji's love in a game of Karuta, an ancient\\nJapanese sport where players must swipe a card that is called out by a speaker. From what I can gather, it's like Bingo, except more aggressive and each card has its own poem associated with it. Since I knew this much, the Karuta games never bothered me that much this time around.\\nWhat does bother me is that almost all of the movie-original characters are very forgettable. With the exception of Momiji, the girl Kazuha is competing against, I couldn't recall any of the other characters involved in this movie.

The Satsuki Cup, which crowns the winner of Japan's Ogura Hyakunin Isshu based competitive\\nkaruta tournament, is currently being filmed inside the facility. The incident results in a big commotion and, while the building is burning to ashes, the only people left inside are Heiji and Kazuha. They get rescued just in time by Conan, who rushes to the scene. Both the identity and motive of the bomber are unknown.\\nWhile confusion takes over due to the explosion, Conan meets a mysterious beautiful girl who claims she is Heiji's fiancée. Her name is Momiji Ōka and she is the Kyoto High School karuta champion. As fate would have it, Kazuha is going to face Momiji in the Hyakunin Isshu competition, so she begins to train with the help of Heiji's mother, Shizuka, who is a skilled Karuta player.\\nAt the same time, in a Japanese house in Arashiyama, Kyoto's outskirts, the reigning Satsuki Cup champion is murdered. Pictures of the crime scene reveal Momji's presence. Additionally, several Karuta cards were spread around the victim.\\nConan and Heiji, along with the Osaka and Kyoto police departments, begin their investigation on the Satsuki Cup and the related murder case. As the inquiry goes on, they come across a secret connected with the Hyakunin Isshu.\\nThe introduction of Momiji to the Detective Conan cast is great on many levels—firstly, she’s a *likable ojō-sama character and secondly, she’s a professional karuta character. Which is awesome! Watch this movie if you’re a diehard fan of Chihayafuru!\\n*Typically, ojō characters are a toss up. Mostly leaning on the unlikable or obnoxious side of the coin.\\nThis is a film that focuses on Heiji and Kazuha’s relationship, similar to the 7th film: Crossroad in the Ancient Capital but with a much stronger narrative. Their relationship has always been a hot topic in the Detective Conan fandom. Despite Heiji’s status as chick magnet with the canon of the show, episodes that emphasized his love for Kazuha, such as ‘And There Were No Mermaids’ arc (episodes 222-223 of the TV series), were so popular that they were reanimated and continually aired *decades after their original broadcast!\\n*And There Were No Mermaids originally aired January 29th, 2001.\\n—Technical\\nThe chief director on this film was Kōbun Shizuno; he is known for his bombastic, larger than life directorial style! His notable works include:\\n•    Detective Conan Movie 15: Quarter of Silence\\n•    Detective Conan Movie 16: The Eleventh Striker\\n•    Detective Conan Movie 17: Private Eye in the Distant Sea\\n•    Detective Conan Movie 18: Dimensional Sniper\\n•    Detective Conan Movie 19: The Hellfire Sunflowers\\n•    Godzilla 1: Planet of the Monsters\\n•    Godzilla 2: City on the Edge of Battle\\n•    Godzilla 3: The Plant Eater\\n•    Hyakka Ryōran: Samurai Bride and Samurai Girls\\n•    Sidonia no Kishi\\nIn the Detective Conan films, Shizuno iconically uses Conan’s soccer-ball-belt frequently as a plot device. Conan using the soccer ball was especially essential in: The Eleventh Striker, Private Eye in the Distant Sea, and The Hellfire Sunflowers!\\nAs usual, in Detective Conan, the story is well-written and the *setting is breathtaking! In an interview, Detective Conan’s mangaka, Gōshō Aoyama, stated that he was initially interested in writing a story about Hyakunin Isshu and karuta after watching the live-action adaptation of *Chihayafuru.\\n*The story takes place in Arashiyama, a mountainous area in the outskirts of Kyōto. Chihayafuru is based off a manga, created by artist—Yuki Suetsugu, that resurrected Japanese interest in karuta and spawned not only a live-action film series but anime and novel adaptations, as well!\\nIf you’re new to the Detective Conan franchise, it is known not only for it’s incredibly talented writing staff but, also, for its cast of top notch seiyū! Recurring characters and their seiyū:\\n•    Conan Edogawa, the titular character has Minami Takayama as his seiyū—Ms. Takayama is a veteran voice actress, not only does anime seiyū work but has also released drama CDs—notably recording dramas for characters such as Ai Amano in Video Girl Ai, Nuriko in Fushigi Yûgi, Myōjin Yahiko in Rurōni Kenshin, and Yuri Suzuki in Red River.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"To be honest Flip Flappers should-be more popular. I felt that it had all the material needed to engage with audiences regardless of their preferences, and most importantly sell great merchandise. The only thing that stopped me from giving the incredible piece of art a solid 10 was the strange and often times confusing story; which I'll get into in a moment so please keep sitting in your chair, or levitating above, you wizards.\\nSo what is Flip Flappers about? Why should you be watching it? Can you eat it? Only two of the three questions above will be answered.\\nFlip Flappers’ story is interesting in many\\nways. We follow the lives two cute girls, there’s intense action, amazing visuals, a yuri undertone lurking. What more could you want— other than nudity, perv.\\nThe Story can be hit or miss depending on your preferences. If you’re into simple story-telling and plot developments then Flip flappers most likely won’t be on your watch list. The plot, the real plot, not fan-service is very confusing at times. It is so bad to the point where I found myself questioning “what the hell going on?” in certain episodes. You see, Flip Flappers method of storytelling is hard to follow…\\nThere are often times too many distractions, mostly imagery, that if you miss a single detail then you will be momentarily confused as to what is happening in the story. This is extremely prevalent when there are scenes filled to the brim with dialogue and monologues. Personally, I found myself getting lost in the vibrant imagery or special effects while characters were talking. Now as far as the story telling goes, the “direction” I have to say that I strongly believe that both the narrative was straight forward as to be expected. Flip Flappers method of storytelling is “the hero’s journey.” For example, think of movies like Harry potter or Lord of the rings.\\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the scenario, something bad or out of the ordinary happens. This causes the girls to go on an adventure to solve the problem; they receive supernatural aid, and get just a bit of character development. As their adventure progresses, they run into the antagonist whom they proceed to do battle with. At this point, “death & rebirth” kicks in. The girls lose, but suddenly realize that this battle is important, plot armor kicks in, and they both gain some sort of supernatural ability that helps them defeat the antagonist. After the grueling battle rests, a predictable outcome, the heroes succeed and head back home where everything is nice and happy.\\nNow with “the journey “that the girls go on. It is not incredible but it sure is unique. During the span of the entire series Papika and Cocnoa are involved in some type of journey that teaches them both lessons. For example they both need each other. They’re friends! Most of the problems the two have to fix during the series, I perceived them as stepping blocks for the two to continue building their budding relationship.\\nThere’s never a dull moment in the Flip Flappers’ story I feel like it provided more than enough entertainment.\\nAt first glance, depending on if you have a good eye or are just really experienced with watching anime. One would assume Gainax worked this title with its unique choices in art. However, they didn’t (as far as my knowledge goes) do much in the animation department. The credits in episode 11 say that they were used for outsourcing. This is common in the anime industry. Personally I believe that their unique art style was used as inspiration for 3hz.\\nBackgrounds are beautiful despite lacking detail and high quality at times. Character designs are unique, cute which is most important. On the other hand, the animation wasn’t as impressive. I felt like there could’ve been improvements to the aesthetics and quality to make the show look more modern. HOWEVER! And Honestly, I think everything worked out. I enjoyed the beauty the show had to offer. It has a sort of “dreamscape” fantasy design to it. This choice fits with the theme of the show. Lastly, the colors are rich and the special effects are fluid.\\nThe soundtrack does an excellent job setting the mood for certain situations. I felt that the composer did a wonderful job of creating songs that fit theme of the show. Happy, jaunty, tunes, the bells are of course the most important part. Voice acting was good to say the least. I didn't feel like the actors were anything special. The opening and ending song... Scratch the opening song. The ending song perfectly describes what the show is about! the sound director deserves to be acknowledge for their contributions to the show.\\nEnjoyment & Overall: Flip flappers deserves some notoriety for its great efforts and contributions to the fall 2016 season. I felt that this title was incredibly fun to watch! The characters, art, soundtrack and story. There was so many things that I liked in the show that made it enjoyable. I had to give Flip Flappers a solid 9/10 because of how great I felt watching everything unfold.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '678b9ff702ad15bcd65a49bd06dcc96c'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers is the textbook definition of a hidden gem. A short, artistic original anime by a relatively unknown studio, and also an anime which is quite difficult to explain. This is partially because of its symbolic themes, but also because the execution itself is very unorthodox. It is like the anime equivalent of an LSD trip; something I can only describe as a crossover of FLCL and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita. But somehow, Studio 3Hz actually made it work, resulting in what I would probably have to consider my favorite anime of Fall 2016.\\nThe story follows two girls who meet each other by coincidence:\\nthe extremely energetic and cheerful Papika, and the much more level-headed and all-round normal Cocona. The somewhat futuristic world which Flip Flappers plays out in does not only contain hoverboards and advanced robotics, but also a fair amount of less explainable things. Supposedly there exists a second, overlapping dimension called Pure Illusion which Papika and Cocona end up stumbling upon by literally falling down a hole into it. This other world is largely responsible for what makes Flip Flappers so different, because in Pure Illusion pretty much anything seems possible. It reminds me of Fantasia a bit with its magical, colourful landscapes, mythical beasts and other strange creatures, doors functioning as teleports, and just a ton of magic in general. Sometimes however it can be sci-fi-esque rather than fantasy-esque, with digital Tron-like cyberspace environments, mechas and more.\\nPapika and Cocona work for the Flip Flap organization, which tasks them with searching for so-called \"amorphous\" fragments within the world of Pure Illusion, which are supposedly capable of granting wishes. These fragments can be found in different kinds of environments within Pure Illusion, which is largely what causes them to end up in such blatantly different surroundings in almost every episode. In their adventures however they end up finding out that Flip Flap is not the only organization on the hunt for amorphous fragments, as they encounter a second group who seemingly wants them for their own ulterior motives. And thus we end up with a lot of fighting in-between the two sides throughout the anime as they keep trying to beat each other to the punch for every fragment.\\nFlip Flappers utilizes the strange world of Pure Illusion in order to tell unusual stories on a mostly episodic basis out of chronological order, and on top of providing interesting adventures it also has a plethora of symbolism underneath the surface. Pretty much everything in this show has a meaning. However, not the entire anime is on an episodic basis. Towards the end, everything starts to connect, and an overarching storyline you might not have even realized was ever there suddenly starts to become visible. Ultimately, it all culminates into a quite grandiose and conclusive ending.\\nBut what really makes Flip Flappers a success to me is that it manages to deliver its deeper messages without it really hampering the fun factor of the anime itself. A common problem I have with more philosophical anime is that they often end up feeling like nothing more than lectures and either turn out to be quite boring (like Mushishi) or just plain cringey (like Yuri Kuma Arashi). But Flip Flappers is actually a ton of sheer light-hearted fun on top of its subtle themes, like a child\\'s imagination come to life with its execution, and even though there is generally way more to each scene than meets the eye, it is still very entertaining to watch. And as a result it actually made me interested enough in the show as a whole to motivate me to pay attention to the details as well, so in a way the fun factor actually made the deeper themes better too. It is the same reason you usually learn more from a class you actually enjoy than one that makes you literally fall asleep.\\nThe characters are overall quite likable but also very symbolic. Papika\\'s bubbly personality is like a representation of childhood innocence, whereas another girl called Yayaka rather seems to symbolize adulthood, with Cocona stuck somewhere in-between the two extremes, unsure what she really wants to do. It\\'s a nice way of combining character diversity with contrasting deeper themes.\\nThe production value is also quite surprising. Studio 3Hz do not have much in their repertoire other than Dimension W and Sora no Method prior to this, but even so they still definitely delivered here. The art style looks incredibly hand-drawn, like something you would normally see in a Studio Ghibli film rather than something you would expect to see airing on TV. But it fits really well with the Fantasia-like setting of Pure Illusion, further enhancing the experience of magic and wonder of it all. And on top of that, Flip Flappers boasts with not just having one of the best opening themes of the entire season, but also quite frankly one of the best ending themes I\\'ve ever heard in anime.\\nOverall, what you have is an anime which honestly does not feel like it has any clear weaknesses in my eyes. The unorthodox setting and story, the way all the dots suddenly connect towards the end, the diverse and symbolic characters, the gorgeous art and the enjoyable theme songs, it is all really good. Just... not utterly amazing either. I guess the biggest downside would be that at times the story will undoubtedly come across as rather confusing, even if you really try to pay attention. Granted, this is all intentional, but that does not really help much in practicality. However, as mentioned earlier, even if you will not understand literally every message that Flip Flappers is trying to convey, I think you should still be able to enjoy it quite a lot. When it all comes down to it, that is probably its greatest strength.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5f38dc9fc9d9b85797d5bc2b05b2f242'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Critics call this series: \"beautiful, imaginative, action-packed, and mysterious\"\\nI\\'ll add that it\\'s also \"diverse, unique, immersive, and, most importantly, it\\'s (*cough*cough* mostly *cough*) coherent!\"\\nFlip Flappers is pretty underrated and will take you on a relatively unpredictable journey with two middle school girls named Papika and Cocona as they travel to another dimension called \"Pure Illusion\". The story begins mysteriously as it follows the warm and simple-minded Papika as she escapes from what looks like a lab and flies off into the night sky on her hoverboard. It then switches to the perspective of the visibly depressed or kuudere Cocona and briefly gives insight into her\\nstruggles to figure who she wants to be and what career path to choose. At this point, no one could have guessed the incredibly diverse future that was in store for these two protagonists.\\nTL;DR at the end\\nI strongly believe that Flip Flappers is one of the most original and imaginative anime ever made. It should get more attention because it definitely has all of the necessary ingredients to become one of the treasured gems of the anime genre. I highly recommend that you check this out if you enjoy diversity, unpredictability, action, and beauty. I usually like to contemplate anime, but this series was so unpredictable and silly that I had to turn my brain off for most of it, haha!\\nStory: 8/10\\nThe concept of other dimensions gave this anime the ability to explore unlimited possibilities. Mechas, ghosts, sci-fi, action, comedy, horror--- you name it and it was probably in Flip Flappers. The overarching plot showcases the growing friendship of Papika and Cocona as they journey to \"Pure Illusion\" to collect rock-like-things that grant a wish once collected (kind of like finding the dragon balls). They eventually come to face opposition from another group that\\'s also trying to collect them. However, ~PLOT TWIST~ things aren’t really as they seem… What real-world consequences will their actions in Pure Illusion have? Do the rocks really grant wishes? Who, exactly, is Papika? In fact, who is Dr. Salt?  In fact... who... are you...? Just kidding, but these are some of the major questions that you might wonder throughout this anime. Overall, I did think it was a bit random (mostly in a good way) and sometimes the randomness strayed from the coherence of the plot. However, the pacing was, nonetheless, great and the stories/sub-stories were all interesting as well.\\nArt: 9/10\\nAlthough the art was mostly simple, it was beautifully simple. The art was deliberately made to look simple and is one of the most colorful anime that I’ve seen. It was truly a work of art! The motion was a bit choppy at times, but you could really FEEL the action. Pure illusion (alternate dimension) was absolutely stunning with rich and vibrant colors, and its artwork was enough to make me feel fully immersed in this series. The art wasn’t good because of its detail, but instead because of its creativity. They did a great job on setting the moods of the diverse settings in Flip Flappers. Sometimes it goes from a fun and light-hearted mood to a sci-fi mood, and then to more darker moods. Although the art was really good, I never once thought “Oh... My... Fuck... BRILLIANCE! MASTERPIECE!” like I did for Unlimited budgetworks (unlimited bladeworks) or Kizumoneygatari (Kizumonogatari) so I couldn\\'t give it a 10 (Visit Kill la Kill or Katanagatari [10/10 Art]) for how to be flambuoyant, but still fluid in animation)\\nSound: 9/10\\nEvery character’s voice matched the character, battle sounds were great, and background noises were normal. The background OSTs were primarily cinematic and didn’t have a memorable central theme like in Fairy tail, Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown, SAO, Madoka Magica, or Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles but it was nonetheless great background music. The opening was pretty good, but the ending was perfect for this anime. The ending was lighthearted, had an Alice-in-Wonderland-like feeling to it, and the artwork really matched the music perfectly. The sound was great overall.\\nCharacter: 6/10\\nI personally think the characters were the weakest part of this anime. All of the characters were cliche tropes that weren’t complex at all. The story was diverse enough that it didn’t matter much, but none of the characters were particularly unique in any way. It’s fine because I’m not sure how they could’ve developed more complex characters with its diverse settings in a matter of only 12 episodes. Their simplicity didn’t really take much away from the anime, but you probably won’t be getting any new favorites from it.\\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was pretty unique, so I think I’ll remember it for a long time. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again someday! That doesn’t happen to me often (I’ve only really re-watched like 2 series). There was just something special about this anime that I haven’t seen elsewhere.\\nOverall: 8/10\\nTL;DR\\nIt was very unique, the story was pretty good, and it was interesting overall, but it could have been better. The story was also extremely diverse but consequently had some very minor inconsistencies. The artwork was creative, but a bit choppy. The sound was great and well-suited to this anime, but not amazing.\\nShould you watch this anime? Well, I totally recommend it personally but:\\nIf you value anime for its uniqueness, then definitely!\\nIf you like artistic anime, then yeah!\\nIf you like girl action anime, then yep!\\nIf you like sci-fi anime, then ehhh you might want to give it a shot...\\nIf you found the story or concept to be intriguing, then you should probably try it for about three episodes...\\nIf you dislike simple anime and tropes, then no because this anime is very simple and trope heavy.\\nIf you dislike “friendship power”, then nah this anime “Fairy Tail”ed at times.\\nHope this helps you make your decision!

       "  <Document: {'content': \"I remember discovering Flip Flappers in the fall 16 anime season and I immediately fell in love with it. It was a fantastic coming of age story that had great characters, beautiful and unique visuals and a funky soundtrack. It was so good that I put Flip Flappers in my top 10 anime to come out from this decade.\\nFast forward to 2019 where this decade of anime is reaching to a close I decided to re-watch Flip Flappers just to see it's truly worthy of being in my top 10 favourite animes from this decade along with stuff like March Comes in Like a Lion,\\nHunter x Hunter 2011, Little Witch Academia TV and The Ancient Magus Bride.\\nAs a middle school student, Cocona has been trying to decide what to do with her life. Magical girl, however, wasn't a career path that she'd ever considered. When suddenly a strange girl named Papika thrusts her into a secret organisation called Flip Flap Conona's outlook does a radical flip-flop. Her views start to chance when she gets dragged by Papika into an alternate dimension called pure illusion where she's charged with gathering crystal shards and facing off strange creatures from various alternate dimensions with the aid of Papika.\\nOn the surface, Flip Flappers looks like you standard throwaway magical girl show from 2006 but when you actually watch the series especially past the first episode you begin to see how special and unique Flip Flappers is. At its core Flip Flappers is a coming of age and adventure tale that features pretty colours, charming characters and attractive symbolism.\\nThe journey aspect of flip flappers while not revolutionary is unique.\\nThe first half of Flip Flappers is like watching two cute girls going on a journey travelling to various worlds, interacting with the set world, learning various life lessons and returning into the own world as different people. This is easily the best part of Flip Flappers story because not only the show was capable of using it's coming of age elements with its captivating symbolism that synthesise well with the narrative but it also brings out a lot of core themes and messages that strengths the characterisation for Conona and Papika.\\nThe second third is for the most part similar to the first third however it started to introduce its core themes and story elements to the mix. Not to mention this is where Flip Flappers comes full on character-driven series putting its episodic structure in the bench. There are a lot of themes that Flip Flappers explored like growing up, puberty, understanding one another, and sexuality and these's were masterfully executed in the anime.\\nIf you are a Yuri fan then Flip Flappers would be your cup of tea. It has a lot of Yuri elements that only strengthens the show's core themes thanks to great direction and writing.\\nDespite Flip Flappers being one of the more unique coming of age stories from this decade of anime, it has one major flaw that prevented Flip Flappers from being one of the all-time greats from this decade and that is the final third aka episodes 9-13.\\nSpoilers aside from the series kinda lost of what it so special in the first place. The shows tried to introduce a lot of new plot elements that weren't explored in the earlier episodes but these new plot elements, unfortunately, fell flat on its face thanks to the lacklustre episode count which is not enough to flesh out the new story elements in the narrative.\\nTo the final third's credit, the ending itself was satisfying as it was able to tie up most of the loose ends. Plus the character development for Cocona, Papika and especially Yakaya in the final third is incredible completely overshadowing most of the issues that I had in the final third.\\nSince Flip Flappers is a coming of age tale, the main characters must be great and interesting to justify the narrative and themes? Lucky the main characters in Flip Flappers were fantastic and well thought out from start to finish.\\nConona is an example of a coming of age protagonist done right. She starts off as a shy and cautious person who doesn't know what to do in life thanks to her lack of social skills that prevented her to socialise with anyone apart from her grandmother and Yakaya.\\nAs the series progresses as Conona spends more time with Papika travelling into various worlds in pure illusion she becomes more social and confident to others.\\nWhile Conona is a greatly written coming of age protagonist, she pales in comparison to the energetic and lovable Papika.\\nShe is my favourite character in Flip Flappers.\\nOn first glance, she appears to your usual girl who is the thirst of adventure. She has no sense of danger and has little understanding of personal boundaries that put people off but as the series, progress Papika not only starts being a more reliable person thanks to great character development.\\nThe best part about Conona and Papika as characters is how strong their character chemistry. At the beginning of the series, Conona didn't care less about Papika but as the series progresses they understand one other thanks to brilliant character interactions and by the end, you really feel that these two are unbreakable.\\nWhile Cocona and Papika were great and well-developed characters, I cannot say a thing for the same thing for the supporting characters. They were not bad characters but at they were pretty forgettable then again that's expected from a coming of age story that is partially focused on a handful of characters but it would have been cool to see some supporting characters get a moment in the spotlight.\\nThe one expectation of this is with Yayaka. Despite being part of a rival/villain organisation she a nicely written character that I loved from start to finish. Her development is a strong as Conona and Papika.\\nFlip Flappers visually can be best described as a firework factory that is filled with pretty and vibrant colours. The various world's that Conona and Papika were beautifully crafted as they all have their own identity. The various colour palettes for the background scenery Characters designs were unique and appealing to look at.\\nMy praise for art doesn't end there. For starters, I really love how Conona and Papika have swapped hair colours when they transform.\\nThen there's the symbolism which is easily the second best things for Flip Flappers.\\nWithout getting into heavy spoiler territory I found the show use of symbolism to be very clever.\\nFrom the change of colour contrast, character movement, imagery and great shot composition the show was able to communicate its narrative and themes through visual storytelling. The only other shows that I saw visuals storytelling done experimentally well is Utena, Penquindrum and Yuri Kuma all works directed by the very talented Kunihiko Ikuhara.\\nThe glorious art is only made better of how smooth, dynamic and crisp the animation is.\\nYou can tell the staff were fans of Gainax and Trigger as almost every fight has that Trigger/Gainax flavour.\\nAs much I love Flip Flappers visuals there was one thing that kinda bothered me and that's the fan-service.\\nFan-service isn't necessarily bad, but, the way the Flip Flappers uses it was pretty distracting. Frequent butts, tights and crotch shots mess up certain key moments in the series.\\nThis wouldn't be such a problem if the characters were not middle school. I understand that puberty is one of the show themes and all but did we need weird and awkward fan-service? I don't think so.\\nThe best word to describe the soundtrack for Flip Flappers is adventurous. Done by the underrated talented music group TO-MAS the score does a fantastic job at capturing the adventurous and mysterious tone of Flip Flappers thanks to the nice choice of upbeat, mysterious, electronic and sci-fi tracks that play in the anime.\\nThe opening theme Serendipity by ZAQ is a great opening that fits the anime perfectly.\\nThe ending theme FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP by TO-MAS feat Chima is one of the best anime ending themes I ever heard in an anime thanks to its catchy and happy nature that masterfully closes an episode of Flip Flappers well.\\nAudio-wise Flip Flappers is very good that features a lot of talented voice actors for both languages.\\nIf I had to pick dub or the original Japanese audio it would pick the dub as it is not only it's one of Sentai Filmworks dubs, in general, the dub actually fitted the show better.\\nAdd this up with the strong performances by Luci Christian (Papika) and Brittney Karbowski (Conona) and you got yourself a great dub especially for Sentai Filmworks standards.\\nFlip Flappers is one of the best and unique coming of age tales I have seen in a long while. The rich thematic exploration charming characters mixed in with splendid soundtrack and the fascinating production values really make Flip Flappers one kind of a series even with its couple of handfuls of flaws from the underdeveloped final third (despite having a lot of good moments) and the shotty use of fan-service.\\nRegardless Flip Flappers is still one of the best animes I have seen from this decade but it's sadly no longer in my top 10 as it is now comfortably sitting in my top 30 rather in my top 10.\\nFlip Flappers is a beautiful ride that I will never forget.\\nThank you Studio 3Hz and the staff for making this near perfect journey possible.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '70aa3995d252738042855cbe4fbb22fb'}>,\n",

The artwork and animation is gorgeous throughout, full of liveliness and energy, capturing everything from fantastical dreamscapes to heated battles to the subtle, little gestures that are so often forgotten. That and the intrigue of the setting and the characters was enough to draw me in. I kept watching for the varied worlds each episode would offer; it reminded me of Space Dandy in that each setting felt like a chance for different artists to go hog wild and really let loose. Papika and Cocona are likable leads to boot, which always helps.\\nSomething I also appreciated was the show\\'s slavish devotion to showing, not telling. There\\'s no narration, no characters explaining every step of their thought process (at first), it\\'s all conveyed through the visuals and the way these characters interact. That can be all too rare in anime and should be applauded.\\nUnfortunately, the last third of the show starts to cram in plot point after plot point, as if the crew realized that they were running out of time. We stop exploring these distant worlds and instead have to drudge through the tedious, infinitely-less interesting backstory. Characters show up with no purpose (NyuNyu). The characters we already have are pretty thin, with little depth or nuance to really explore. We have yet another \"small child with reality warping powers of a god running amok\" plot. Then the whole thing ends with so many threads unresolved at best or completely forgotten about at worst; Yayaka, who\\'s friendship with Cocona is the basis for a powerful turning point in Ep 8, is almost entirely redundant by the end and gets no conclusion to her arc. The story doesn\\'t end, it just stops.\\nIt\\'s a shame that a rushed end can damage an otherwise good or even great show, but that\\'s why execution is so, so important.\\nAll that being said, don\\'t take this 6 to mean its bad. I would still heartily recommend Flip Flappers as a whole; it\\'s breathtaking to look at and, at its best, it\\'s a wildly fun and imaginative ride.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Papika and Cocona. Remember those two names well. Flip Flappers chronicles the adventure of these two girls as they venture into a world known as the “Pure Illusion”. For a girl like Cocona, this is a dramatic change of her life. Think about it though. If you certainly got dragged into a world of unknown, wouldn’t you be curious, scared, or excited? Those are the sort of feelings I was expecting this show at first. It’s expecting the unexpected.\\nAs an original anime, viewers need not to worry about faithfulness related to adaptation. Also, director Oshiyama Kiyotaka puts his talent to work. For those who are\\nunfamiliar with his resume, he’s been involved with various projects pertaining with sci-fi elements. (ex. Space Dandy, Bounen no Xamdou, etc) As such, you should expect to see plenty of expressive ideas and creativity that he pours into Flip Flappers. The first few episodes seems to also draw influences from fairy tales such as Alice in Wonderland. However, the story itself is much different as the Pure Illusion world brings unnatural ideas to reality. The basic concept is two girls working for a mysterious “Flip Flap” organization in order to collect amorphous fragments. These fragments are implied to have the power to grant wishes.\\nI have to admit, watching Flip Flappers began as nothing short but exciting. My original impression was something along the line of a magical girl series of cute girls doing cute things while trying to accomplish a goal together. That quickly evolved as we see how action packed this show can really be. The third episode will leave you in awe as the audience will be presented with a spectacular battle. It adds elements that can draw similarity from other popular works such as Mad Max or Fist of the North Star. For this reason, Flip Flappers breaks the mold of the usual cute girls doing cute things but derives into more of a surrealistic adventure. That adventure takes place mainly in the Pure Illusion world where many creative ideas are used. What makes their adventure special is that while it can feel crazy and wild at times, it retains the strengths of storytelling and at the same time updating it for today’s audiences. The storytelling also gets more complex as we learn more about the main characters (specifically their past) and connections to the Pure Illusion world. The supernatural phenomenon and purpose of the characters will also be realized that easily can draw the viewers’ curiosity frequently.\\nOf course, Flip Flappers can’t shine without its characters. That’s where our main protagonists, Papika and Cocona comes in. Papika and Cocona are sort of polar opposites on side of a coin. Cocona is a pretty serious girl who seems somewhat insecure about her future. She attends a school but is often cautious about people and events around her. It seems that she is often careful about letting others get close to her. This is the opposite for Cocona, a highly energetic girl who seems to be very interested in Cocona. The two develops a unique relationship as they explore the Pure Illusion world in all its glory. What I find most interesting about their relationship goes beyond just a charming character chemistry. Rather, it’s how Papika’s influence seems to change Cocona. She becomes livelier, sheds her initial reservations, and better express her emotions to others. It’s also hinted at many times that Cocona seems to view Papika as much more than just a friend. To me, her character goes under heavy changes as she begins to realize her purpose in the world.  Remember, she was very unsure about her future but finds purpose through her character connection with Papika. On the other hand, there’s Papika, the girl that always wants to get close with Cocona. She naturally tries to become her friend from the very start despite Cocona’s cautious personality. From my point of view, she is like the light of that Cocona is searching for in a dark tunnel. She is able to open Cocona’s eyes to a brighter future.\\nBesides Papika and Cocona, we are also introduced to other characters in the show. Yayaka (Cocona’s childhood friend) is perhaps the most prominent one among those introduced as she has a past history with Cocona. However, the most intriguing part is how her role in the show also has influences on Cocona. The way this show adapts character drama becomes more and more emotional as time goes on. Now, what I do have some concern with is the later stages of the series as more revelations regarding Cocona is revealed and those that gets involved in her life. The antagonist in this show may or may not be likable for their roles. It’s also easy to say that while I do enjoy the character drama, it can sometimes feel a bit forced and thrown into the face of the audience. However, one thing is for sure. It’s still pretty convincing way to explore human emotions. Jealousy, regret, apathy, compassion, loneliness, love, shame, acceptance are just a few of those.\\nProduced by studio 3Hz, I have to admit, the show feels like something out of a fairy book when it comes to visual dynamics. It gives a very picturesque feeling with its setting that sharply contrasts between the real world and the Pure Illusion world. In fact, fairy tale allusions enter the show itself such as with the animal motifs and stylistic dresses. As more episodes progresses, there’s even mecha that enters the story! That being said, the show’s risks paid off for its visual quality and is more than just about being symbolic or unique. It’s there to show that Flip Flappers stands out as a show on its own merits. Character designs and transformations may seem like a generic magical girl theme but retain its surrealistic expression. Speaking of expressions, characters convey that exceptionally well to display their emotions. Cocona is a prime example as this as she is the most human character in the show while Papika’s goofy personality makes the series more relaxing and playful to watch. As I mentioned before, the battle segments in this show is fast paced yet precisely crafted. Think of it similar to FLCL or Gurren Lagann as it displays the talented directing of the staff. When in motion, it’s when the action really becomes epic. There’s also some fan service (namely an episode with swimsuits) but that really shouldn’t hold you back from watching the show.\\nThe soundtrack and music offers a unique dynamic to the show as well. In particular, the ED theme song highlights the talent of Kiyotaka Oshiyama’s directing as the lyrics has a balanced rhythm. The OST also offers a good balance between intense battle segments to the more emotional dialogues. This comes with character voice mannerism that is impressively performed by the voice actresses. I’m mostly impressed at the two main leads – Cocona and Papika. The two are able to deliver their lines in such a believable way that it’s just hard to ever turn heads away from them. I mean, who can ignore their iconic “Flip Flapping!” line?\\nAh Flip Flappers, an underrated gem that some people may have overlooked this year. It’s a series that brings fantasy to a surrealistic level in a world of unimaginable possibilities. The characters play their roles in a fashion that has meaningful purpose while always arousing the curiosity of the audience. Storytelling may or may not suit your tastes but I’d still advise in giving this show a chance.

The two girls go to these worlds, which may be quite deadly, for no reason beyond curiosity and a prize that neither seems to care about.  They desire the greater goal of getting \"a wish\" but they barely care about the 10 or so pieces they need in order to actually get the wish.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers is a show I didn’t initially care about as I just saw it as an average cutesy fantasy show. Magical girls, inter-dimensional journeys, cute aesthetics, these are things that the show possess that have been done before already. I wasn’t a fan of the cast at first as well. Most of the cast lack substance and the two main characters Cocona and Papika’s rollercoaster relationship annoyed me to death. However, I kept watching and every new journey that unfolds lead to new things that continually picked up my interest. It eventually peaked and came to the realization that this show proved that it\\nhas a lot of potential, albeit not all of them has come to fruition.\\nThe first thing that fascinated me is the visuals. They are just hypnotizing as we are presented the world of Pure Illusion and how it contrasts with the real world. The animation is good yet eccentric at times with its bright colors and fast-paced scene transitions, like a constant attempt to grab the viewer’s attention. It’s honestly the main reason I didn’t decide to drop the show early on, it’s just a well-done eye candy.\\nThe setting looks generic but it keeps on unveiling a lot of things, though gimmicky at times, as the main duo travels through the different faces of Pure Illusion. It helped me understand the characters better as it reflects the character’s perspective. Cocona sees it as a nuisance yet Papika sees it as an adventure. Yayaka sees it as a long-term mission and the rest of the cast sees it as a mystery. This conflict aided the strengthening of relationships especially the two main characters who seemingly fight all the time.\\nAs the show progressed in the second half, major revelations are being dropped one by one which caught me off-guard. The whole Pure Illusion started making sense with respect to what the objective of the story is. While I mostly received this as a positive thing, it’s also problematic since the show decided to suddenly go deep into the story when it’s been doing well episodically beforehand.\\nLike mentioned before, the show has a lot of potential as it keeps opening these potential plot points by the episode. New aspects of the setting are being explored, the characters are starting to get fleshed out, and the story is starting to take flight with the real objective being uncovered. However, not all of them were addressed by the end of the show. There were a lot of questions and mysteries left to what the show was trying to offer. It’s like we are presented these tasty ingredients prepared to be transformed into a dish, but the product feels unfinished. Nevertheless, the story remains solid enough to not crumble on itself.\\nOverall, Flip Flappers managed to go beyond my underwhelming first impression. It turned out to be one of the best shows this season had to offer. It’s a show recommended to those who like cute girls dealing with fantasy elements with a bit of personal edge to it. Well-presented, consistent, cutesy, heartwarming, I think I already written enough trying to describe how a surprising delight this show is despite addressing a considerable amount of issues but give it a shot anyway.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Finding the hidden gem of a year is always the best feeling an anime fan could feel. In my short experience with seasonal anime (following seasonal stuff since around 4 seasons ago as of the creation of this review), completing this series was my reminder of why I follow seasons in the first place. Watching anime weekly provides the opportunity to try out stuff one would have never had given a shot if certain series were completed. I was really having trouble containing my thoughts for this series, which is why this review will serve as the way to express them. An anime who\\'s name\\nis what I imagined the title for a soulless kids show would be... get this... Flip Flappers.\\nMinor Spoilers ahead. My overall thoughts can be found in the last paragraph for those too lazy to read, though I doubt this will be long anyways.\\nStory: 7/10\\nThe story of Flip Flappers can\\'t really be detailed in much ways without getting into spoiler territory. MAL\\'s synopsis for once does a good job at saying what this show is about (without spoiling), but it does not do the events that occur justice in every episode. The main character Cocona is an everyday middle school girl that encounters a red-haired, eccentric girl of her age (in a flying surfboard of all things) named Papika. Shortly after their first interaction, they end up in a parallel world where it snows 24/7 and giant white-haired mammoths are the norm. After a life threatening situation, the main girl\\'s thigh birthmark starts glowing, she goes badass Super Saying and saves her (it sounds weird, I know). What happens next is a sort of \"episodic\" adventure between our main characters, with each passing episode embracing its random nature. Explosive sakuga action, fun comedy, the discovery of intriguing worlds, yuri undertones and an insane mix of ideas ensue.\\nWhen I said this show is \"episodic\", there was a reason that I added it in quotation. This show does have a very linear plot. The reason I said episodic is because for the majority of the series, there\\'s a huge \"where the hell is this going?\" vibe. At the end of each episode the viewer is left off with more questions than answers, wondering if their questions are going to be answered at some point. It sounds bad but trust me, the show shines its brightest when its setting things up.\\nThe story of this show is between two rival\\xa0 secret organizations who send out middleschoolers (the two main girls working for one of these two) to look for mysterious \"fragments\" said to being capable of granting any wish if all are collected. Pretty straightforward and decent, but I found the main plot to be way more uninteresting than the \"episodic\" adventure. Basically, in the last episodes, the creator(s) making this show realized that they needed to wrap things up and answer things, so they did the best they could do to provide a satisfying ending. The end result wasn\\'t bad by any means, but it is pretty evident that they focused more on making this a fun experience rather than having a thought-provoking plot. This reminds me of my experience with Re:Zero, where I enjoyed the journey a hell of a lot more than the main story. The story of Flip Flappers comes off as simple and lackluster compared to the insane ride we were given during the first 9-10 episodes or so. Since the show has to explain what they have set up, the last couple of episodes changes focus to other side characters that are crucial to the plot, but far more uninteresting than the original duo. My wish is that Studio 3Hz would have an unlimited budget to keep making episodic adventures between Cocona and Papika who are the real stars of Flip Flappers.\\nPop-culture References:\\nIt is always very interesting when a show references other famous works in pop-culture. This show didn\\'t just made one or two references to real life works (for example how 3-gatsu no Lion referenced My Neighbor Totoro and made it a running gag, which was pretty cool btw), the show literally has anything and everything that would make the show cooler. It\\'s like the creators of this show sat down one day, wrote down everything they liked from modern entertainment and decided to add it to Flip Flappers. Some include the following: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, how they literally chase a rabbit through a hole like in Alice in Wonderland, Star Wars\\' Tatooine, Dragon Ball\\'s transformations and fight scenes, Mad Max vehicles and enemies, mayhem like in The Warrior and the Sorceress, a little bit of over-the-top animation from Ginax, Jackie Chan fighting maneuvers from Drunken Master, every Magical Girl anime ever, every Mech anime ever, Power Rangers, and many more that I am too lazy to look for. The show even does references to historical people and groups, like how a character is named after a German Biologist Jakob von Uexküll and how the baddies visualy are a carbon copy of the KKK (yep). Most references happen in the parallel worlds of \"Pure Illusion\" and seeing how unique and insane each look, I would have loved to see more, but sadly the anime has to come to an end and I am left wondering what other crazy worlds were left undiscovered.\\nYuri Undertones/Exploring Sexuality:\\nFor those who didn\\'t follow discussions for this anime as it aired, there were plenty of talks whether this anime was a commentary on the LGBT experience told through a middleschooler and the self-discovery of being queer. For example, in many instances the show seemed to hint at something far greater than just presenting how good of friends Cocona and Papika are. Camera angles, optical illusions dealing with perception, fanservice, and other methods of cinematography were used to hint of a possible relationship between the two main girls. Hell, there\\'s even an episode where Cocona straight up questions if her love for her friend Papika is just that, a friendship. Being completely honest here, I got pretty excited when stuff like this occurred (not in a perverted way, baka). In my opinion there aren\\'t enough anime out there that explore sexuality, and the ones that do do not explore it in the way Flip Flappers does. An anime that dives into queer discovery being told through the eyes of a teenage girl, plus adding kickass sakuga and fun comedy sounds golden in my opinion. The setup was there and the subtlety was present, so did it deliver? Well, it depends on who you ask. The show takes the route where if you do not want these themes to be a part of your experience with this series then you will be okay (except for episode 7 were the yuri reaches its highest point). The best way I could describe it (being the geek I am) is comparing it to an Easter Egg in a movie or videogame. It\\'s present for those who look for it, and those who don\\'t bother to look deeper will never know. If you are looking for something more than just undertones you will be dissapointed just like I was. Don\\'t get me wrong, I did enjoy the yuri subtleties that were present, but I cannot help but end with a bad taste of feeling like I was yuri-bated yet again. My crave for them yuris will never be satisfied.\\nArt: 9/10\\nOne of Flip Flappers\\' best attributes is without a doubt its visuals. This show is full of impressive sakuga action moments that look pretty amazing when they want to be (holy snap epsiode 3 was impressive). Of course it has its still moments, but for the most part it is a visual extravaganza, especially when the characters are in the parallel worlds part of what is known as \"Pure Illusion\" where the possibilities of fantasy are endless. The character designs are good and my only nitpick is that I found the character\\'s eyes to be too far apart from each other making them look a bit weird to me at first, but again this is just a nitpick that I completely forgot about later on. Colors are also used heavily to convey emotion and establish a mood. Fanservice is apperant from time to time, but it\\'s not \"in your face panties and tits\", rather more subtle and tasteful which I can at least appreciate.\\nSound: 8/10\\nThe soundtrack is another thing that is worth mentioning. It is not the best thing I\\'ve heard by any means, but it does a great job at setting the correct mood. The opening and ending songs are permanently stuck in my brain until I die because they are catchy as hell (I\\'m listening to the ED as I\\'m typing this ffs). The opening especially is perfectly fitting for this series. Just take a second and go check out the OP and tell me it doesn\\'t get you hyped to watch the show.\\nCharacter: 7/10\\nWhat makes Flip Flappers such a great show (apart from all the unique worlds) is the characters, specifically the main duo you see on the cover. They have very different personalities, Cocona being a rather shy, cautious and well-behaved girl that cares for her loved ones and Papika acting as her polar opposite, with the only thing that they have in common is their love for others and one another. This back and forth between two completely different people make for very interesting dynamics and comedic situations. The side characters are okay with some having more development than others, but overall there wasn\\'t a character I disliked (except for that pink-haired scientist that is just obnoxiously loud and serves as an unfunny comedic character).\\nConclusion:\\nIn the end, Flip Flappers is by far one of the most underrated and overlooked anime of the year. It is a memorable story about a girl overcoming her difficulties, and this self-growth is portrayed through parallel worlds that defy logic and understanding. It starts out great and gets better and better as the series progresses. Unfortunately, the last three episodes take a simplified route at answering the viewers questions that were built up throughout the series and is not nearly as good as the rest. Is it a yuri? Is it a magical girl show? Is it a clusterfuck of ideas? I\\'m not entirely sure yet, but what I can say is that Flip Flappers is one hell of a ride.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '718a3ce97ffe2b546423044ca1fffcac'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'As with any type of storytelling media, the overall value of a show will be inevitably judged by how much the viewer makes out of it. And, if there’s a show that exemplifies this idea of a viewer’s dedication to enjoying something affecting their overall opinion of it, it’s a strange little magical girl show from Fall of 2016.\\nFlip Flappers is one of the most polarizing series I’ve ever seen in anime. On the one hand, there are those who would defend it as ingenious and philosophically meaningful, while on the other hand there are those who dismiss it as cheap yuribait with a contrived\\nand unfitting final arc. Obviously, I’m not going to be in the hate camp. But I won’t be trying to defend the show’s philosophical value either. I’m simply here to explain the reasons why I enjoyed a fun little Alice-in-Wonderland-style romp through the mind-bending world of Pure Illusion.\\nCHARACTERS - 7/10\\nThe characters in this series are quite simple to understand, be it for better or for worse. Three stand out as our main heroines: Cocona, a melancholic schoolgirl who desires to quietly lead a normal, safe life but often finds herself going on fantastic adventures; Papika, an energetic girl who seems to be the polar opposite of Cocona in almost every way, and Yayaka, a more mature girl who seems to be grounded in reality as is Cocona, but even less so susceptible to the emotions that drive Papika.\\nSome fans have compared these three girls to the proposed three parts of the human psyche: id, ego and superego. This comparison would paint a picture of Cocona (ego) being pulled towards emotional, spontaneous desires by Papika (id) while simultaneously being pulled toward more realistic, colder motivations by Yayaka (superego). Now, there is no way to confirm whether or not the writers initially intended to structure the interactions of their characters in this way. However, it certainly makes for interesting and believable interactions, because the fact remains that, whether intentionally or not, the characters do reflect the psyche and the internal conflicts felt by almost everyone.\\nOne of the biggest appeals of this show is the way that it embraces the “show, don’t tell” style of storytelling. The first eight episodes of the show focus almost solely on Cocona’s relationship with Papika, demonstrating to the viewers their characteristics and the clashes in their ideals by putting them in various fantasy situations that they’ll need to work together to get out of. Because of how, as the viewers, we able to experience the girls’ interactions firsthand rather than by being told about them via exposition dumps, the climax of the series when Yayaka starts to play a bigger role in the story feels much more meaningful than it would have if the show hadn’t spent its first two-thirds introducing us to our characters.\\nThe side characters, although fun, don’t serve much of a purpose other than to provide occasional exposition or fanservice. However, each of them, no matter how small their role in the story may be, undergoes a complete character arc by the finale. All of their motivations and worldviews are explained through flashbacks, which additionally help us to understand their reasons for doing what they do and, more importantly, why Pure Illusion behaves for them in the way that it does.\\nVISUALS - 9/10\\nEasily one of the strongest aspects of this show is the visual style. The art is totally unique, looking very much like a strange combination of SHAFT’s character designs and Trigger’s vibrant, energetic artistry. The characters are drawn beautifully, and the landscapes of Pure Illusion somehow look even better. The trippy watercolors that blend together to form the backgrounds are stunning, and very well convey the atmosphere for any given episode. The dull grays that blend together during the “horror” episode set a completely different tone than the neon lights of the “mecha” episode, which feels altogether unique when compared to the infamous “Mad Max” episode.\\nBecause Flip Flappers is a show about differences in perception of reality, another thing that it does exceedingly well is conveying a character’s emotion by showing what they can see. In one episode, Cocona and Papika are experiencing childhood through the eyes of girl in a dysfunctional family. When she walks in on her parents fighting, they are drawn very loosely, and they pulsate and distort, colors blending and changing to reflect the terror and confusion that this girl feels.\\nFlip Flappers also likes to tell its story through the use of symbolism and optical illusions. Early on, a character shows up who will later be revealed to be a villain masquerading as a kindhearted woman. Her first few appearances depict her as the famous illusion that makes it impossible to identify whether the figure in question is a beautiful girl or an old hag. Later on, the show teaches us to associate two characters with each other by giving them the same clover crown at two different times in two different episodes. It even warns us that it will get darker near the end during the first episode, when Cocona and Papika huddle together in the unmistakable shape of a human skull. Even simple things like inconsistencies in reflections tell entire stories in themselves, and a sharp-eyed viewer is rewarded handsomely for their attention to detail. If you pay close attention, you can predict almost the entire show just by watching the OP.\\nFinally, the animation during action sequences is absolutely brilliant. The fights are characterized by colorful explosions and bright streaks of color as the camera does loops and flips to follow our heroines. My personal favorite sequence is when Cocona and Papika fall through a tunnel into Pure Illusion, and the lines of their characters and the colors of ear skin and clothes begin to change and flash in a total acid trip of gorgeous animation. There is a beautiful scene when someone explodes into clover leaves that drift through the air in a single spectacular shot.\\nDuring the final episode, the Flip Flappers team ran into budget problems. Because of this, there is an obvious drop in quality during the finale, causing the show to just look “good” and not “phenomenal.” But hey - Evangelion ran into the same situation, and everyone loves that show.\\nSOUND - 10/10\\nThe soundtrack is, simply put, one of the best I’ve ever heard. The OP is very catchy, and all of the insert songs are memorable and fit the tone of the scene well. However, the real shining point in the soundtrack is the ED, which is not only easily the best ending theme ever, but one of the best pieces of music ever. Listening to the ED just once will give you a good idea of how the series plays out. It starts as a simple, upbeat song accompanied by little bubbles and other sound effects that fully immerse you in its musical world, but it gradually evolves into an epic, more-than-slightly foreboding and mysterious orchestral piece that sounds like something out of Madoka Magica.\\nSTORY - 7/10\\nFlip Flappers is a show about the Umwelt. The Umwelt is a theory proposed by a scientist named Uexkull (people who have watched the first few episodes of Flip Flappers may recognize Uexkull as the name of Cocona’s pet rabbit). This theory states that perception of reality is different for every given organism, and that each interpretation of the same experience is just as correct as the next. This show takes the seemingly abstract and advanced concept of Umwelten and makes it much more accessible and fun by presenting us with a story about two magical girls who have the ability to jump into these realities created by other people’s interpretations of their surroundings.\\nNow, what sets Flip Flappers apart from other magical girl anime is the fact that, after jumping into these Umwelten (called “Pure Illusion” in the show), what our characters do has a clear effect on the “real” world after they leave. Large amounts of the story are told through symbolism, and the viewer has to be paying full attention in order to get the full experience. For the first eight episodes, very little plot development actually occurs, or, at least, very little that is immediately visible. The final arc harkens back to everything that has happened thus far, and has the potential to catch the viewer by surprise if they got too used to the idea of being drip-fed a story. Flip Flappers draws influences from, parodies, and gives not-so-subtle nods to (some would even say “rips off”) Evangelion, Mad Max, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, Alice in Wonderland, and Nausicaa, to name a few. I won’t try to defend these influences due to the fact that they didn’t bother me. The story was still a good one, and that was what mattered.\\nThere are many theories as to what deeper meanings may be concealed within Flip Flappers’ eccentric plot. One of the more obvious points is the fact that, as the story goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that Cocona and Papika are in love with each other. As Cocona struggles to come to terms with her sexuality, she is eventually forced to confront an over-protective mother who is less than pleased that her daughter is a lesbian.\\nAdditionally, Pure Illusion has been compared to the Dantean model of Hell by some, as various characters in the show state that Pure Illusion has layers, much like Dante’s model. Symbols of Hell and similar concepts such as the Thinker statue, the Drowning of Ophelia, and a literal vision of eternal damnation populate the show’s early episodes. Now, as I said, I’m not going to try and defend the show’s supposed philosophical value. But I will state that the entire series is very open to interpretation, almost as though it is the viewer’s own Umwelt. I can’t say whether or not this is intentional, but it’s very enjoyable either way.\\nThe show can be divided logically into two halves. As previously stated, the first half is about Cocona and Papika’s relationship, and is very episodic. Some of the episodes suffer pacing issues, but nothing too dramatically awkward happens. Following the girls’ ninth trip into Pure Illusion, the plot finally kicks in and the show starts to feel more deconstructive, or at least much darker and more mature. Similar to how the Harry Potter books get progressively darker to reflect Harry’s maturing, Flip Flappers does the same as Cocona finally comes to terms with her sexuality. This is what has awarded the show with the most criticism: the ending. However, it didn’t bother me, because I saw it coming all along.\\nENJOYMENT - 9/10\\nThere’s not much to say here. I love this show. I would run home from school on Thursdays just to watch the latest episode, then lie down and ponder it for at least a good hour afterwards. I participated in drawing the great big thank you card that /a/ sent to the studio after the last episode.\\nOVERALL - 8/10\\nFlip Flappers is quite the enjoyable ride, for someone willing to keep an open mind and accept the show for what it is. It’s unique and pretty, if nothing else. Give it a try, and see if it suits your taste. If you aren’t sold by episode 5, it’s probably not going to be worth your time. But if you’re looking for something equal parts tender and intricate, this is a perfect choice.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '2204127e919b0634d7017764c9adafda'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'If something makes you happy, excited, or sets off another string of convoluted positive emotions, it’s kinda tough not to like. Hell, even things that makes you scared, anxious, or want to cry, emotions that seem negative in nature, are contributing factors to why you might like something. Think back to whenever someone tried to explain why they loved “Clannad: After Story” with “it made me cry,” or think back to whenever someone told you why they loved “Shingeki no Kyojin” with “I couldn’t stop looking at the screen!” The same can be applied to why people love those moe slice of life anime, it\\njust makes them happy. It’s tough to beat emotion with logic, which is why Flip Flappers felt so damn successful. A world where anything could happen, the writers do what they want because they felt like it, not limiting themselves to a set of rules or principles, and goddamn, it was lovely. Every episode explored a new world, with new characters and a different sense of fun each and everytime. Flip Flappers understood perfectly well how to have a good time, and it was an absolute fucking blast to watch.\\nHowever, all of the fun can easily be destroyed in the face of an underwhelming ending. Flip Flappers was shaping up to be a wonderful series, but a sudden shift from episodic fun to an attempt at establishing a serious story changed everything. You could certainly argue that the final arc was what they were going for the whole time, while everything else was filler, but the “filler” was still significantly better than the actual story. Somehow, even the absolutely gorgeous animation had suffered. In comparison to everything else, the final scenes looked underwhelming. This may seem like a silly criticism, but for a show that boasts visual beauty, it’s disappointing when that beauty fades. Even then, I wouldn’t mind if the story managed to stay on track, but it doesn’t.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFun Beginnings\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFlip Flappers absolutely decimated my expectations. The cover screamed nothing more than another typical magical girl anime. However, it really is so much more. This series is about exploration, travelling beyond the unknown, and doing crazy things for the sake of fun.\\nThe series surrounds a middle school girl, Cocona, being carried away from her boring, mundane world by a very mysterious girl, Papika. Cocona gets introduced to this “portal” device that will allow her and Papika to travel to whatever world necessary in order to complete their objective. This objective is to obtain crystal shards, which Papika is having trouble gathering on her own, so she enlists Cocona to help her as best as she can.\\nEven if you haven’t seen the series, it’s pretty clear that this is a setup for something of an episodic nature. At first, the focus was on Papika, Cocona, and their adventures (or perhaps misadventures) within all of these varying places. Every episode explored a new world, and each world possessed strikingly different themes in a wonderful attempt at originality. It’s hard to confine Flip Flappers to one genre, because it tries so many things over the course of its thirteen episodes. A few examples:\\nThere’s an episode where Papika ventures across a gorgeous orange desert in a battle to the death against a group of bandits. She was trying to protect a weak village of weak creatures, and when she squares off against their leader, she practically goes Super Saiyan, and you see the two zooming across the sky as if you’re watching Dragon Ball Z. This episode is clearly inspired by the super power genre.\\nThere’s an episode where Cocona and Papika have to pilot giant mechs and battle with other giant mechs over the backdrop of a gorgeous neon city, destroying most of that city in the process. This episode is clearly inspired by the mecha genre.\\nThere’s an episode where Cocona and Papika get trapped in a school, where doll-like figures with giant black holes for eyes follow them around telling them that all they want is to be their “friend.” This episode is clearly inspired by the horror genre.\\nIt was hard not to appreciate what the series was trying to do, as every time I clicked “next episode,” I knew I was in for new. This was an absolutely wonderful change from what I had been used to. I was simply in love in with this sense of adventure.\\nHowever, Flip Flappers once again decimated my expectations, except this time it wasn’t in a positive sense. The last third tries to give us a real story. It tries to wrap up what it had set up, and it wants to leave us on a good note. I could understand this, as having the series stay episodic through and through was probably a scary thought, so the creators might’ve wanted to at least give it an ending. However, this final arc doesn’t manage to be as likable as the rest of the series, and it really destroyed some of the fun.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nNot-so-fun Endings\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFlip Flappers loses its charm when the creators shift the tone entirely. It tries to develop the characters backstories, give everything some kind of relevance, and they finally tell us what the hell is going on. There’s nothing wrong with what it was aiming for, but it just doesn’t work out the way I would have hoped.\\nWhat had happened to Papika and Cocona in their lives is incredibly compelling, and genuinely got me excited. Seeing Papika’s relationship to Cocona’s mother, and how they were stripped away from each other in such a barbaric way gave me goosebumps. We also get an explanation on why they’re searching for these shards, who the people chasing Papika and Cocona are, and why Cocona’s life is the way it is. Everything was explained decently, and at the start of the serious arc, I was convinced that it would work out pretty well.\\nHowever, where things start to get messy is when the series encroaches upon the conclusion. As Papika and Cocona draw closer, in an attempt to “save” each other, things become more about love, faith, and their “bond.” This sort of escapism might have worked before, in the mystical and whimsical portion of the series, but after giving us this serious, edgy, more depressing backdrop, all tension is diluted when it’s solved so inconsistently. The goosebumps faded away, and I was left with an empty feeling. It didn’t help that the animation started to take a serious hit. The final scenes felt underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the series. Not only the animation, but where all the previous fights were these epic unbelievable brawls, the final fight was more about hyping up a super-move of love to one-shot the final boss. Even if this was consistent with what the show was originally going for, the changing of the tone towards the end didn’t help that they decided to transition back into what they were originally going for out of nowhere.\\nEven if you disregard this, it’s not like the serious arc was being handled too well to begin with. Sure, I liked some parts of it, but it didn’t change that the writing started to get a bit messy, characters were acting inconsistently, and the story felt underwhelming with its attempt to dramatize everything. Seeing Papika and Cocona go from lovely, fun personas to this serious bunch with edgy backstories felt out of place. I started to get used to it, but then it did a complete flip and they went back to what they originally were. It’s hard to be sure what to feel at this point, so all I could do was watch aimlessly.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nConclusion\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nFlip Flappers starts out wonderfully, giving us a taste of pure fun for the sake of fun. It does whatever the hell it wants in an attempt to excite you, and it really works. Where things start to fail is when they try to create a darker story, characters, and tone. The serious arc is unfortunately very underwhelming. Although it isn’t bad, it never manages to be as fantastic as the series was beforehand. Flip Flappers really could’ve been something, and I’ll never stop being disappointed that it didn’t turn out the way I wanted.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8f93052db9d2fa651c931a6e307ecc51'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Dimension Jumping Magical Girls with a dash of a \"Coming of Age story\" and a paintbucket full of beautifully bizarre scenery!\\nLA wants to get straight into it...so let\\'s dive into the technical rabbit hole shall we?.\\nFlip Flapper\\'s plot format for the first 10 episodes goes into a \"World a Week\" kind of schema but using movie and anime references as it\\'s settings, such examples being Episode 3 having Fist of the North Star and Mad Max Fury Road settings to Episode 5 having the Shining merged with yuri genre settings to even the meta-narrative of \"archetypes and HECK the MECHA genre in one episode. Even\\ntheir transformation sequences harkens to Pretty Cure\\'s transformations to the point it\\'s oozed into their attack names. The plot format surrounds Papika and Cocona trying to find the the \"amorphorus\" for the FliFlap organization under the various omni-genred episodes we get for unknown reasons and another rival organization by the name of Asclepius trying to get it as well for the first 9 episodes. Really these early 9 episodes was to emphasis and develop the relationship between our two main leads of Papika and Cocona through going through their trials and tribulations of their relationship and most importantly Cocona\\'s indecisiveness, they both face when going into the Pure Illusion worlds. Come episode 10, all the hints and the reasoning to getting the amorphorus, Papika in general, Cocona\\'s involvement in all this, Pure Illusion in general all comes into full force, something LA wasn\\'t HARDLY expecting. In all respects, this development isn\\'t exactly new as the hints were their just subtle in it\\'s approach and because of this, the plot twists come episode 10 were amazingly executed, what happens after episode 10, the omni-genred feature of self-reflection and coming of age story for Cocona for Flip Flappers quickly changed into a yuri shounen anime...seriously that\\'s the vibe LA got after this development, but that a bit later.\\nPapika and Cocona are polar opposites for the most part and although it\\'s an easy opposites attract what with Papika the hyper-always genki character who\\'s rather clingy to Cocona, her mysteriousness can kinda be a saving grace to Papika (which was LA\\'s perspective). Cocona on the other hand, is a strict, no nonsense character though she opens up halfway through the anime though she reverts or becomes confused by her relationship to Papika (quite frankly metaphorically visually shown in one episode). There is one other character, Yayaka who\\'s a friend of Cocona but she\\'s ALOT more that you\\'d realize and becomes a rather focused character by the end of it and her rivalry both in character and relationship to Papika and Cocona respectively really made an interesting character and really impacted the major plotline during the first 8 to 9 episodes, because of that she quite easily was LA\\'s favourite character in the series.\\nThere are other minor characters that do get their own development episodes but through LA\\'s perspective is shown through some of the Pure Illusion worlds, the most easily noticable being Iroha Irodori voiced by Saori Oonishi and if you could interpret it, Hidaka voiced by Jun Fukushima. Once again come episode 10, a floodgate worth of character and plot development focus on many of the secrets of Asclepius and FliFlap comes into focus and essentially reigns in character development from the various characters surrounding these two secret organizations WHILE keeping Papika and Cocona\\'s development simultaneously. LA really can\\'t explain more otherwise it goes GREATLY in spoilers, especially one character development who\\'s enveloped and connect to ALL of this.\\nThe voice acting, there are two notable seiyuu\\'s LA has to take note of, Ayaka Ohashi as Yayaka and Minami Takahashi as Cocona, they both nailed their characters greatly as well as giving them a wide vocal range though Minami had stuck round with the indecisively shy vocals due to Cocona during the beginning but she like Papika\\'s seiyuu M.A.O got better over time. On speaking of which, M.A.O as Papika was narrowly annoying due to M.A.O\\'s constant hyper genki status throughout their adventures and both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi shouting each others name in a moe cadence gotten M.A.O a bit of slack, but seriously, both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi as seiyuu\\'s definitely gotten better over time. The rest of the vocal cast was pretty decent though some had the inflictions of hyper genkiness that M.A.O had like Jun Fukushima as Hidaka and NyuNyu\\'s voice actor (was uncredited as LA wrote this). LA thought the one notable from the minor cast would easily go to Welwitschia\\'s voice actor Aki Toyosaki in voicing one of the episodic villains and MAN did Aki go hammy in this one!.\\nAs for the soundtrack, LA quite easily loved both the OP and ED for this anime, but most definitely Flip Flappers OP \"Serendipity\" by ZAQ was LA\\'s favourite OP for Fall 2016. The ED, \"FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP\" by TO-MAS feat.Chima added to the bizarre fairy tale book feel to the anime and at times during cliffhangars did bring in either a moodswinger once this ED arrived but nonetheless both OP and ED were great for Flip Flappers. LA doesn\\'t have much to say about the OST in general, though it was atmospheric to say the most, but the OST and the sakuga used blended soo well that LA hardly noticed the OST half the time (though LA is saying this in a good light).\\nThe animation, as LA stated at the preamble, Flip Flappers is an outright sakuga fest of animation and it\\'s the more fantastical and broad reach of atmospheric detail from the crazy landscapes of the desert to tron-like cities to classic architecture to the more creepy mansion worlds and fast frantic battles makes LA be reminded of an Alice in Wonderland meets Anime kind of appeal to it\\'s animation. The character designs are \"exotic\" and color-coded for easy distinction, not to mention LA just loves the parallels in color brought onto Papika and Cocona, easily coming from how Papika and Cocoa\\'s hair color swaps during their transformation sequences further emphasizing Papika and Cocona\\'s relationship with one another. What can LA say for Studio 3Hz, but if the anime\\'s plot isn\\'t getting to you, the animation most certainly will.\\nThe final three episodes if anything really did change into a cohesive narrative instead of the episodic BUT at the same time tying loose ends towards those episodic episodes and even call backs to them, this also gave a HUGE amount of character development to Yayaka, however she\\'s a really heavy spoiler character in Flip Flappers overall, what LA will say is that because of these final three episodes, she herself came to her own realization and she became a very focused and 3-dimensional character. This also leads up to Cocona\\'s own realization which comes in the form of the surprise major \"villain\" of the anime which brings themes of \"fate or your own freedom\" which again ties up loose resolutions towards both Cocona\\'s adventuring with Papika throughout all the Pure Illusions to Cocona\\'s relationship to Papika solidifying itself by the penultimate episode. As much as the narrative structure changed, it also helped that the \"episodic episodes\" lead into something much greater and just wasn\\'t used to be \"filler-ish\" episodes which gets revisited at one point along with a few relational indecisiveness from Cocona to have a resolution but it also helped in the character development to most of the major characters as well. If there was but one flaw LA could see in the final arc was that it condensed what was the mystery and subtle background hinting to the bigger picture into a simple yet slightly complicated story with a villain who doesn\\'t know any better (though again not a bad villain on that regards due to the circumstances) with only the major characters impacting the plot. What compensated all this was the weird and intensely fantastical final battle with this villain along with it resolving the majority of the plotlines, THAT was enough to satisfy LA with this kind of ending.\\nFlip Flappers\\' episodic omni-genred nature to quickly change into a simple story with a villain just to resolve all the mystery behind Pure Illusion, Papika and Yayaka along with Cocona\\'s indecisiveness. Flip Flappers had a great thing going with it\\'s fantastical Pure Illusion worlds and the romp and character self-reflection, \"coming of age story\" as subtle hinting as good themes coming from these wondrous Pure Illusion worlds, it stumbled slightly however once it went into a cohesive narrative and turning what could have been turned into an anime with a bigger picture into a simple story, but LA can quite honestly give a saving grace for how the ending was resolved along with that final battle, but other flaws such as it\\'s lacking character development from it\\'s minor cast but nonetheless, LA doesn\\'t think Flip Flappers NEEDED to fill ALL basis to be a great anime, what Flip Flappers ended with was good enough not to get LA\\'s scorn for. Yet still praise it\\'s storytelling in the form of Cocona\\'s coming of age story, brilliant animation, soundtrack and satisfyingly resolved ending.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '11f00e1d788da5a0443b2952c8d611d3'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'When keeping up with 2016 anime, I would often watch a title with a nagging sense that something was missing - something I wasn\\'t seeing that was keeping a show with a workable or seemingly exciting premise from being truly engaging. And yet, for the longest time I couldn’t quite put my finger on exactly what that something was.\\nThen, as the year approached its end, I was shown a world almost entirely unlike anything I knew from that year. Suddenly, it all made sense! What was missing was surprisingly simple: a sense of passion - ambition! A willingness to take risks - to try something\\nbold, run with it confidently, and, perhaps most importantly, to have fun along the way!\\nThis key ingredient sums up exactly what Flip Flappers sets out to do, and for the most part, it delivers in style! It’s not a show that’s interested in playing it safe, running with the pack, or following the norm. It does its own thing in its own world. It remains committed to this and never looks back. Not only does it feel novel, but as it runs, it succeeds in providing something many of its contemporaries struggle with: pure, unapologetic fun.\\nThe show immediately pops with a striking presentation style that is excellent for the experience it attempts to create. Anytime the setting enters the whimsical world of Pure Illusion (which it very frequently does), a vibrant and impressionistic colour palette combines with sketchbook character designs to create worlds which immediately pop out at viewers; smears and flashes of colour - the worlds themselves - comes alive onscreen through highly expressive and fluid animation, all backed by a suitably fantastical score. Whenever this show wants to sell a big set piece, bombastic moment or climactic sequence, it does so with ease, energy and expression filling every frame! These moments are exciting; often breathtaking, and they combine with a general livelihood and an ever-present sense of wonder and novelty to immediately make Flip Flappers a fun watch!\\nBut such moments aren’t the only things contributing to this anime\\'s flair. The very nature of Pure Illusion - an abstract world which seems loosely representative of characters\\' inner states of mind - is a perfect fit for this style of entertainment. Flip Flappers can effortlessly realize just about any setting it wants without it ever feeling out of place, nor completely random. This is great for keeping the level of variety and creativity consistently high. With this, and since much of the show runs on a cohesive semi-episodic structure, pretty much any crazy idea the show comes up with can be successfully built up to, and then executed with gusto!\\nAnd so, when the main pair of magical girls suddenly finds itself in an epic high-speed flying surfboard chase to escape from a crazy torture factory, or a DBZ-style fight involving a mind-altering mask culminating in a meteoric final smash, it works like a charm!\\nAll of this crazy not-quite-randomness is thankfully held together by a controlled yet dynamic sense of tone and pacing. Each episode offers something new - something fresh - and each one makes an effort to go all-out with itself. In addition, it all ties into a core theme of the show: that of identity. Pure illusion itself is an expression of this, and in terms of story, each episode for most of the series tackles aspects of the theme in a different and interesting manner. One particular highlight of this (and of the show’s writing as a whole) came in episode 6. I won’t say any more on the matter, but it remains one of my favourite anime episodes of 2016. Point being, the show has a sense of cohesion that keeps most of it from feeling too unhinged, and allows viewers to build up expectations that it can subsequently defy in any number of ways.\\nJust a few episodes in, I was already preparing to crown this my favourite anime of fall 2016 by far! And... in the end, I definitely think this is a show worth watching, but unfortunately, it hits a few stumbles.\\nFor all the strengths of the show’s presentation and structure, the characterization is often lackluster. While the main characters aren’t one-dimensional, per se, they tend to lack in depth or detail that could really make them interesting to invest in. The main duo of Cocona and Papika can certainly be fun to watch as they contrast with and bounce off each other, but this dynamic relies heavily on moment-to-moment chemistry and less on meaningful conflict or development. That’s not to say it isn’t present. Cocona in particular does go through several instances of personal conflict and development - disagreements with Papika’s adventurous ideologies being one example - but little of it, for Cocona or any other character, is presented with the kind of weight, importance or urgency to get a viewer eager to see them grow or overcome any difficulty. Similar things can be said for the rest of the main cast. As for the supporting characters, they’re pretty forgettable, with maybe one or two exceptions (Again, I refer to episode 6). As a whole, the characters don’t actively harm the show, but rarely do much for it either.\\nOne may also notice many of my aforementioned praises apply to \"most\" of Flip Flappers. Alas, it admittedly falters a bit later on, and in ways that prevents it from ultimately reaching its full potential. Sometime around the halfway point, Flip Flappers had a change of writers, and it shows. I suspect the general direction of the story was either changed or left on the sidelines for too long, because when things finally start unravel, they REALLY unravel. And so does the quality of storytelling. As if from nowhere, the show decides it has a ton of plot to reveal, and is going to pick up the pace as much as it deems necessary to get through it all.\\nHow much is that, exactly? Enough that all the viewer\\'s attention is suddenly fixated on following this mass of new information and development, instead of actually enjoying the ride. Flip Flappers, which relies so heavily on its apparent simplicity and well-paced structure to remain grounded - to create its special brand of charm - loses itself to a degree when it comes unhinged. In its strives for progression, it sacrifices any chance to be reflective or create a sense of wonder and fascination, and it doesn\\'t leave the audience much time to catch their breath either.\\nThe result resembles a rollercoaster whose design was unexpectedly and radically altered partway through assembly. What was once a carefully-paced ride quickly becomes a tornado of loops and corkscrews and twists and turns one after another, and another, and another, and another, while the track suddenly becomes bumpier and more hastily-thrown together at the expense of rider comfort!\\nIt’s almost as though they got two-thirds of the way through construction and realized the track was too straightforward, so they decided to build THREE TIMES AS MANY CRAZY TURNS into the last third to compensate! “What’s that?! We’ll make our riders dizzy?! No worries! We’ve got them in the cart already!” I admire the ambition, but Flip Flappers may have tried to tackle just a tad TOO much. Attempting to cram all the resulting plot development into 4-5 episodes was always going to be nigh impossible without the pacing suffering to a degree. If it had been granted a longer construction time and was a 2-cour series, then likely none of this would have been a problem, but regardless, what we got was, at times, a bit of a mess.\\nThankfully, Flip Flappers doesn’t completely lose its way during this segment. Even at its clumsiest of times, it never completely loses direction, and if one can keep up with its frenetic pace, the story can still be followed to a degree. In addition, its sense of expressiveness and energy remains mostly intact throughout, while the visual quality stays impressively consistent. And fortunately, this jerky ride still eventually reaches a fairly satisfying and conclusive stopping point (ending) so riders can steady themselves.\\nOne final silver lining to the comparatively weaker third act actually emerges from the previous ones, and that is the show’s knack for effective foreshadowing. For all the twists, turns and unexpected bits of information Flip Flappers eventually blasts through, many of them are actually built up to quite well. While a few things still feel a bit spontaneous, Flip Flappers as a whole rarely seems to haphazardly throw out its plot twists without some level of setup. I won\\'t be giving anything away here, as even with the chaotic structure near the end, discovering these things can be fun to an extent. Amidst all of them, though, there was one revelation in particular that really impressed me with its unusual yet brilliant method of foreshadowing. Without giving too much information, one of the ways it hints at itself is through the very structure of certain episodes themselves, and the effect that structure has on the viewer. If that sounds rather meta, you’d be right, but if it sounds like I’m overthinking things, I can affirm I’m not.\\nIf only the viewer was a bit more invested in the character(s) involved. Then, perhaps, this revelation would have had more impact - beyond its novel execution - and indeed, the same can be said for the show as a whole.\\nUltimately, Flip Flappers concludes itself as an imperfect but valuable marvel. It strides forth unexpectedly, as if from another other world, seemingly out of nowhere, to show what it can achieve! As a thematically varied audiovisual treat, full of creative energy, it possesses a rare, passionate desire to do what many series forgot how to do: to just have fun for once. In today’s period of frequent anime monotony, Flip Flappers stands out as a welcome modern breath of fresh air; one that knows its strengths, and plays to them well.\\n- FINAL SCORES & SUMMARIES -\\n* Critical Quality: 6.5/10 (Story - 6 | Art - 9 | Sound - 7 | Character - 5)\\n– Despite some late-game plotting and pacing weaknesses, as well as functional but unremarkable characterization, Flip Flappers excels where it counts. Its top-notch, vibrant, energetic presentation and consistent creativity really help it succeed.\\n* Memorability: 7.5/10 – In addition to a strong sense of novelty, Flip Flappers knows how to craft creative and memorable moments and properly sell them, and does so frequently; it all gives this series a very unique identity.\\n* Enjoyment: 6.5/10 – My enjoyment was brought down a fair bit by the final third, which simply wasn’t as engaging as the rest despite all the surprises and plot developments. But the “rest” I refer to was definitely a fun ride!\\n* Overall: 6.5/10 – Flip Flappers didn’t quite reach the highs I was initially hoping for, but I still consider it a respectable series that achieved what it set out to do. Even with its setbacks, it has enough standout qualities to make it well worth watching, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone interested. One small warning, though: the ending theme won\\'t be leaving your head for a while.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '452952d4273ccf1c23714bfae4b82c07'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Flip Flappers is one of those anime that craves a visual feast for the eyes rather than telling a cohesive narrative and developing interesting characters. This is rather an exception; Flip Flappers is a gorgeous looking anime. Brimming with strikingly colorful aesthetics of a whimsical fantasy world. The uniqueness of designing a fantasy world with different variations of its own world is a feat. Flip Flappers is all about visual presentation and it rightfully executes how that whimsical fantasy world can be. So why does this get a 6 regardless of the fact the anime has vast potential to be an underrated/hidden gem? Well, everything\\nelse was just overlooked and these overlooked aspect is what set apart of the cracks shown.\\nCocona is our central protagonist of Flip Flappers; A quiet and reserved ordinary schoolgirl encounters a strange hyperactive girl named Papika, who finds complete interest in Cocona just from her nice fragrance or scent. Papika drags Cocona into an alternate dimension strayed from their normal one, thus began their wild adventures of what is known as Pure Illusion. Not much is rather further developed beyond Papika's blatant fascination with Cocona and Cocona's indecisiveness whether she likes being on an adventure with said clingy hyperactive Papika. Their relationship can be summed up into a yuri-bait connection that felt forced. Yes, it is explained why Papika acts the way she does in later episodes but it does come off obnoxious when we are reminded that she loves Cocona. The other side characters are either forgettable and uninteresting even the ones that are developed.\\nIf there is one thing that Flip Flappers excels the most is the art design; the colorful cast of characters are very distinguishable and each episode have variety of art from cutesy and fun to gloomy and dark. The character designs are very adorable especially the main heroines. The colors pops or stands out to blend the aesthetics of the details in the background; a pleasing eye candy. The animation is also a noteworthy praise with intense heart pumping action. Although, the action sequences were just the icing on the cake. Nonetheless, the art is gorgeous to look at\\nThe structure of an episodic adventure is really good set up of variety of different imaginative and creative world Pure Illusion has to offer. It can range from a sci-fi Tron-like cyberpunk city to a post apocalyptic Mad Max setting. These aspects are implemented within these world and takes a unique spin of these worlds like adding mechs and magical girl power-ups. However, the following final act is what set the bar low on the expansive world of Pure Illusion felt artificial than what was already established.\\nThis is where the major criticism that hurts the overall experience of Flip Flappers. The final act/climax was clearly extremely rushed and the lack of direction. Characters are randomly added out of nowhere and served no purpose to the plot, excessive amount of exposition dump and seamless explanations of the world, removing the sense of boundless exploration that Pure Illusion was set to establish in the beginning. At this certain point, the interest was lost and the climax was focused on the story than the random adventures.\\nI don't think Flip Flappers is bad, far from it. The poor writing, weak characterization, and the finale suffers the show's potential of an actual hidden gem. I wanted this to be something special than other mediocre obscure shows yet seeing through the cracks cannot be overlooked. Still, the the uniqueness of Flip Flappers will always be the visual presentation and how it was executed significantly as an eye candy experience. Watching Flip Flappers only for the aesthetics is your main reason why it is worth watching. It is a fun joyride through wild imaginative creativity.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c3a6e356690f44b77feab43bea6dc4af'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': '(Updated 12/31)\\nFor anyone who\\'s seen the other works of Studio 3Hz, you\\'d know that they created Sora no Method, which spiked about a 6.7/10 on MyAnimeList, and continues to be criticized for one of the worst plot holes seen in anime. On top of Sora no Method, Dimension W, a Sci-Fi Seinen that got pretty popular spiked about 7.3/10 on MyAnimeList. Studio 3Hz didn\\'t do Dimension W on their own, the did it in part with the studio Orange, and besides Sora no Method, there seemed to be no original, redeeming work that could make a name for this studio.\\nFall 2016 rolls around, and with\\nthe releases of several new fan favorites and a few new sequels to popular anime, Flip Flappers was one of the releases. Just like every season, there\\'s seemingly one or two anime that get pushed aside and not really mentioned, and Flip Flappers is one of those anime. Does it deserve it? Absolutely not.\\nFlip Flappers is something totally different, a breath of fresh air in terms of animation, character, music, story, and setting. Every time I watched an episode of Flip Flappers, I felt happy, relaxed, and desperate to watch the next episode. It starts early with a hook, and it definitely keeps you reeled in.\\nStudio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this fun, colorful, beautiful, and enjoyable anime with extremely likable characters, both protagonist and antagonist and even background characters who are hardly mentioned.\\nStory - 8\\nFlip Flappers has a concept I\\'ve never seen portrayed in anime. The collection of \"fragments\" throughout the setting of Pure Illusion is both relaxing and will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The setting Studio 3Hz set for Flip Flappers is gorgeous and so flexible, so full of adventure and molds the story into something that\\'s beautiful, enjoyable, and allows viewers to feel like they\\'re a part of the world Flip Flappers portrays.\\nHowever, what keeps the story from the perfect 10 is that in the first 4-5 episodes, the story seems scattered and spotty. The execution of the story is weak, but eventually the hook that starts in the second episode with more story in Pure Illusion makes the story eventually progress like it should. The first few episodes seem to lack follow a plot that progresses later into the anime, it\\'s more to show us, the viewers, the world of Pure Illusion, and the inhabitants and natives of Pure Illusion.\\nIf the story in the beginning would\\'ve started off with the story of Cocona\\'s confusion about her life, and about her parents, and how she\\'s started going to Pure Illusion after meeting Papika, then this score would be much higher.\\nArt - 10\\nFlip Flappers has gorgeous animation and character and setting design that Studio 3Hz has never indulged in. To quote my friend, it has that \"Trigger\" feel to it. The feeling that reminds you of Kill la Kill or Uchuu Patrol Luluco. The animation is smooth, the setting of Pure Illusion is gorgeously portrayed and makes you want to pause so you don\\'t miss a single thing it shows you. Even when the setting isn\\'t in Pure Illusion, the art is still bright and colorful.\\nEven when the ambience on the animation and color is turned down to a darker scale, like in some parts of Pure Illusion or at night time, it still pops out and looks gorgeous. The art is extraordinary.\\nSound - 10\\nPersonally my favorite part of the show is the sound and music. I\\'ll be honest to tell you that the opening song and ending song are probably on my top favorite anime songs of all time. The music is just the right amount of hype to get the viewers excited for the episode that follows, and the ending song is peaceful and has the viewers on their toes desperate for the next episode, so they can experience the beautiful atmosphere this anime create.\\nThe sound for the battles that happen are realistic, but also add to the added Sci-Fi genre Flip Flappers have, giving it that \"futuristic\" feel. That\\'s what I love most about this anime - it\\'s Sci-Fi, but it\\'s not a Sci-Fi that\\'s ruined with over-the-top cliches, especially in terms of the sound. The ambience and sound in Pure Illusion just hypes up the gorgeous setting more and more.\\nCharacter - 9\\nThe characters in Flip Flappers are unique and all differentiate from one another. We have Cocona, who later in the anime has more of an important role than the beginning, but is portrayed at first as an idolized honors student. Papika is a mixture of our comic relief, but is also Cocona\\'s loyal, cute, and enjoyable partner. Together, these two take adventure into Pure Illusion, where we meet Yayaka, who is partnered with Yuyu and Toto. Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto prove to be interesting characters and great antagonists for our heroes Cocona and Papika.\\nWith Pure Illusion being used in the first few episodes just to show off how this universe and world work, we are given a variety of unique and amazing characters that do not come back after the episode they\\'re premiered in. Characters like Welwitschia would be amazing to see work alongside Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto, but is seemingly removed right after her appearance. Uexküll, Cocona\\'s pet rabbit, is given a good chunk of screen time in the beginning and is seemingly shown to maybe have an impact in the show, but never actually does a lot. And the addition of TT-392, or Buu-chan could\\'ve been done so much better. Buu-chan seems to have a lot of potential, but is easily manipulated and converts to whatever female antagonist is thrown at us, and seems to be more of a hinderance than a partner to Cocona and Papika.\\nEnjoyment - 10\\nAs I\\'ve continually mentioned in my review, the anime\\'s hook starts right when we\\'re introduced to Cocona\\'s and Papika\\'s delve into the wonderful and gorgeous world of Pure Illusion. The anime is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to delve into the same adventures of Cocona and Papika (Studio 3Hz, Flip Flappers game pleaseee?) Every Thursday watching this anime, I was so excited for the newest episodes to come out that I would wait at the 30 minute mark before they came onto Crunchyroll just to watch them right then and there.\\nThis show is extremely fun and enjoyable, and it\\'s definitely my pick for my absolute favorite for Fall 2016.\\nOverall - 9.4/10 (rounded down to 9/10)\\nI could not recommend this anime more. It\\'s so fun and so stunning, Studio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this.\\nWATCH. THIS.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Flip Flappers is an original entry in the magical girl genre focused on middle school student Cocona and her interactions with the energetic Papika as both adventure in the alternate world of Pure Illusion taking on enemy creatures and acquiring magical powers from the amorphus gems that are left behind by the creatures when defeated.\\nThe one thing that sticks out with Flip Flappers is its gorgeous animation when the series is taken over to Pure Illusion. The scenery of Pure Illusion offers up some rather creative and bizarre environments and enemies that Cocona and Papika encounter in their adventures that include a colorful landscape where\\nour two heroines start to develop rabbit-like characteristics and a gloomy version of their school that traps the two girls in a time loop. There are a variety in the types of threats that Cocona and Papika have to confront within Pure Illusion that allow for some variety in the type of choreography seen in action scenes throughout the series from a typical superhero-powered battle to even a mecha fight. The animation has some shortcomings with character designs looking a bit on the simple side for details in certain regards and some of the animated sequences looking a bit jerky with movement. But these don't detract too heavily from the rather unique presentation offered with Flip Flappers.\\nMoving past presentation, Flip Flappers' storytelling is mostly straightforward with focusing on Cocona and Papika's adventures. The first half of the series is mostly focused on the two girls collecting the amorphus gems they acquire from defeated enemy creatures, learning more about the world of Pure Illusions, developing their relationship, and crossing paths with a rival organization also seeking out the amorphus gems for mysterious reasons. There are hints dropped in early episodes that Cocona and Papika may have a closer connection than what it would seem on the surface. The second half gradually explores these developments (and what is revealed leads to a dramatic twist for the series compared to its more light-hearted mood) and the motives of the rival organization in question, which eventually build up to a climactic battle that tests the bond that our two heroines established with one another throughout the course of the series. The revelations mostly make sense when looking back on some of the hints dropped, though there are a few unclear elements to the plot that Flip Flappers regrettably does not address in its finale.\\nMinor issues aside, Flip Flappers was still a solid entry in the magical girl genre having a creative alternate world that Cocona and Papika have their adventures in and offers up an engaging plot focused on exploring the bond and connections that our two heroines have with one another.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers is without a doubt eye-pleasing. The first half of the series is intuitive, spontaneous, and entertaining. At first, the story is confusing.

The show\\'s themes require you to think a little bit and piece it together which can be challenging but interesting. It makes you think and each scene is meticulously made to probe thought. But as you watch more you\\'ll find the themes resonate more as a coming-of-age\\nstory surrounding the main character, Cocona such as gaining independence and exploring your place in the world and identifying who you in relationship to the people around you.\\nUnless you wanted this theme explicit to you, then this may not be the anime for you.\\nOtherwise, this anime relies on animation a lot to help the audience make inferences about the story and drive the momentum of the story. However, this also means that the characters are not fleshed out enough. I feel like the show had a lot of opportunities to grow their characters more but a lot of them are left without actual substance to the story. For instance, there are a few characters that come up that are seemingly important but if you were to think of their contribution to the anime as a whole, that importance may not be there.\\nAlso, the pacing of the anime is confusing (perhaps re-watching might change my mind about this). The first half of the series is a slow-build and it gets more intense towards the last 4-5 episodes.

The use of colors and animation is superb and impressively consistent. An ongoing problem with the show is that there\\'s a plot holes in most of the episodes (probably due to their heavy reliance on using animation to tell the story) and become more frequent in the end of the series. However the ambiguity makes you think and urges you to piece it together.\\nAlso, there is a tendency of throwing too much information at the audience especially towards the end of the series.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'A Flip Flappers Review\\nThis is a series that really had me going for a while. I knew almost nothing about Flip Flappers going in, and to my pleasant surprise, the show made me want to learn everything about it within a couple of episodes. It presented something that felt so fresh and original while also displaying an unspoken variation on that of which it was derived. Building off of magical girls in magical worlds, Flip Flappers reimagined what came before it with a heaping amount of playful ambiguity and managed to stay utterly engaging despite how thoroughly confounding the show probably would’ve looked to be\\non paper.\\nThe first three quarters of the season exemplified this, as we watch the main character Cocona get dragged into a world of “Pure Illusion” by Papika, a girl who’s seemingly very innocent, passionate, and hard to communicate with. We’re given about as much information about this strange new place (and the strange people entangled with this situation) as Cocona is, which is to say barely anything at all. “Pure Illusion” is what the name implies, and exists in a space separate but connected(?) to reality. These two, who originality meet by Pure chance, have the ability enter these worlds and search for “amorphous fragments”. Nothing is explained about what these things do or why they need to be collected, we just know that Papika has a desire to collect them.\\nThe show is full of unclear motivations, be it with the immensely ominous organization of assumed villainy or the tiny group of underdogs that are seemingly the “good guys”. It’s all a matter of only answering the most rudimentary question of “what it is they want”. For most of the season it’s not revealed why exactly they want these fragments or how they’re going to go about utilizing them. With such bare-bone motivations, it might be hard to imagine just how this show could be so compelling without a firm grasp on the stakes at play.\\nWell as it turns out, clear-cut stakes aren’t always necessary in capturing a viewer’s full attention. By putting a heavy focus on the characters, Flip Flappers directs its narrative spotlight away from the plot and instead concentrates on the two main characters and their growth. As Cocona’s and Papika’s relationship goes back and forth between love, resentment, confusion, and other neurotic emotions, we’re able to witness Cocona open herself up and also shut herself in as she tries to make sense of what exactly is happening. Their personalities complete each other, as Cocona has quite the anxious spirit, but also just enough indecisiveness that she’s able to be dragged along by Papika’s innocent fearlessness. Together they take part in the joys of unbridled adventure, and no adventure would be complete without a few hurdles.\\nAs if these random worlds of pure imagination weren’t already dangerous enough, Cocona and Papika turn out to have some competition. Cocona’s childhood friend Yayaka turns out to be some sort of trained hunter of amorphous fragments, and alongside her are two monotone sidekicks that seem to be robots because of their complete lack of compassion, but it’s never actually delved into. All we know is that they work for that ominous evil group. Of course, only the audience gets a glimpse of this and not Cocona, but the villainous force behind these three is a massive cult with an unknown goal and an unmeasured amount of power at their fingertips. It’s only to be assumed that they are in fact “evil”, but it’s a pretty safe bet considering their outfits look like the KKK. An interesting choice, but race has ultimately nothing to do with the show. Instead what I think was meant by this aesthetic choice was to convey a sense of overwhelming and misguided desire for purity. Anyway, the mysterious ambition of the group remains unwavering, but Yayaka herself is not quite as committed. As the story progresses, she begins to show her feelings for Cocona and how those emotions are a detriment to their cause whenever the girls end up fighting over amorphous fragments. And that’s about when we get into the final quarter of the season.\\nThe way the show set itself up to be until this point was something I thought was extraordinary. I felt like I knew so much about these characters in a raw, impassioned sense, rather than in a manner of just learning the cold, hard details. Flip Flappers didn’t tell me a damn thing, and it really felt like the show expected viewers to understand the basic formula of the action genre because it wouldn’t explain almost any of it. It would play with these illusionary settings to illicit certain response from its characters as well as convey things about them through the environment. Episode 6: “Pure Play” for example, plays with color and memory, contrasting warm, homely recollections with cold, morose reminders of loneliness and pain, all by having individual characters and settings colored with either shades of orange or blue.\\nIt was thoroughly engaging and thought provoking, as Flip Flappers treaded the not often taken path of showing its story rather than telling it. Not that either approach is necessarily better than the other, but Flip Flappers started with the former and I was hoping it would stay that way. Instead, it suddenly devolves into a very contrived exercise of needless exposition. Certain characters sit in a very mundane setting as one of them explains to the other their view of what exactly is going on, and why the fate of the world depends on it. Then the show flashes back to the cause of Pure Illusion and makes sense of how these characters got to be entangled in it, in a very straightforward fashion. The story becomes something else entirely, and while I don’t think the final twist is at all a bad one, it lacks the narrative presentation that made the show unique in the first place.\\nWithout getting into spoilers (I’ll save that topic for another time), motivations are made clear by the end, yet the show still has some non-philosophical or particularly interesting questions left unanswered. Certain characters are introduced for what appear to be absolutely no reason. Specifically, a loli character with a ridiculous outfit that serves no practical purpose whatsoever. There’s also an art student that’s around for about two episodes then just disappears, plus we never really learn anything about the amorphous twins or what they do after it’s all over. It’s strange that the show is leaves these random things ambiguous, when just a moment ago it seemed to want to explain everything to its audience.\\nThe ending, while I think strong at its core (again, saving that discussion for later), is a bit random and what surrounds it is poorly thrown together. It starts to lose focus on Cocona and Papika, which was the most powerful thing the show had going for it. The center of attention stretches too far as it allows characters with almost no screen time up until this point to suddenly have important roles to play, which just ends up feeling like a feeble attempt to tie everything and everyone together. The show has three distinct characters’ worthy of attention, and it probably should’ve just kept that focus rather than throw in more needless elements that don’t all entirely come into fruition.\\nIt’s a true shame considering most of the show was a Pure delight. The animation is superb, the action is incredibly satisfying, and the settings of Pure Illusion range from wondrous and awe-inspiring to very contained and deliberate in conveying a sense of characters and relationships. Not only that, some of the worlds seem to be forms of charming parodies, like the desert wasteland reminiscent of the planet Tatooine from Star Wars.\\nNow before I end this review, I’d like to give spotlight to my favorite character: Papika. She is a very interesting type of character, one that I can only recall in all my history of watching anime one other time. While she isn’t explicitly defined to be this kind of person, it seems to me that she indeed has some form of mental impairment. Her compulsiveness, strange social behavior, single-minded persistence, and limited speech patterns; I’ve only researched a little about it for this review, but I’m pretty certain it has to be autism. And that’s a really interesting and hard to understand perspective, not only to introduce in a story, but to create as a main protagonist. The way she shares the stage with Cocona demonstrates that regardless of mental impairments, they’re both equals. Then their reliance on each other show they’re both incomplete. And I guess I just find Papika to be the more fascinating side of the relationship because her disabilities and incredibly innocent outlook on life offer a perspective not as common as the insecurities that ail Cocona and define her personality.\\nFor the most part, Flip Flappers is unabashedly unique and adventurous. While I was personally disappointed in how thing play out in the end, it couldn’t possibly ruin the intrigue and elation I’d felt leading up to that point. Its settings are amazingly vibrant, creative, and push characters in smart directions while sometimes telling even more about them than the dialogue itself. The characters will certainly stick with me, and although I’m glad their story was contained within a single season, I also can’t help but long for more. Without a doubt, watching Flip Flappers was a…Pure joy *snickers as everyone reading this rolls their eyes*.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a07a6d7cffb43099c3f0166c805d351b'}>,\n",

There were so many places they visited, all of which were packed with slight, well thought out details. Every frame interconnected fluently, and with all this came a wad of diversity. Near the end (no spoilers don't worry), Some of the characters' eyes start to slightly change color, and you can easily tell why. The art in this show is soo good, all I can do is look up to them and wish I could explain how their art is so much better than many, many other shows.\\nAlright, I know I said those didn't need to be mentioned but I rambled on about them all anyway. Now onto the two lowest scored parts, both of which I rated nines, Story and Enjoyment. I will combine these into one little paragraph as the reason I didn't give enjoyment a 10 is because the story didn't quite reach a 10. At the beginning, I loved it. I told all my friends about it. Don't get me wrong, I did the same at the end, but things got a little wobbly in the last few episodes (just like before, there's no spoilers, no worries), but, like all shows, the climax started to kick in, and it started to get wobbly. Many things happened and plot holes were cleared up, some of which made a lot of sense, but others seemed random. Things began to happen simply because it made the most sense, and it did, everything was fluent, but when I started to fanboy about it, I realized there were some things that made absolutely no sense. And when some characters were going through changes it often times felt rushed and/or pushed to advance the show. To be exact, I felt slightly confused and annoyed by this a total of 2-3 times.\\nOther than these small little holes that arise when concluding an episode, or the show as a whole, the premise of the entire anime is (9) Great. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was eager to watch the next episode. The show kept my eyes glued to the screen, and this is without a doubt a fantastic show. Everything flowed together like bread and butter and gave so much room for creativity in such a masterpiece.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'I always thought Puella Magi Madoka Magica would be unbeatable to me in the Mahou Shoujo genre, until this little piece came around. It’s a shame, too, because I feel like this show definitely went under most viewer’s radars during airing and even now is an anime that few people seem to realize exist. And that’s disappointing because it really is an incredible anime, and my personal favorite magical girl show. This is for a few reasons;\\nThe art. This show is visually stunning and beautiful. Pure Illusion, the alternate reality our two heroines Cocona and Papika continually venture into, is about the closest I can\\nimagine to what an acid trip must be. The alternate realities the girls venture into change every episode; one day it’s a vast, beautiful snowy land with massive beasts wriggling across the surface, the next it’s a dazzling neon city full of mechanical creatures, and the next it’s a desolate environment raining blood with an ominous clock tower chiming in the distance. The show really makes these exotic realities come to life, and most of the enjoyment of the show simply comes from watching the girls explore these bizarre places.\\nThe story. The story of this show mostly concerns the aforementioned heroines Cocona, a reclusive and generally indecisive girl, and Papika, the bold and brash girl with a heart for an adventure. They really only have one goal at the outset; to explore the world of Pure Illusion and have a great time. Of course, there’s a few other forces at play; as it turns out, the world of Pure Illusion has some very interesting relics which are of secondary importance to our heroines. These relics though are VERY important to the show’s main antagonistic group, Yayaka (Cocona’s childhood friend) and the Twins. Cocona and Papika are constantly running into the group during their forays into Pure Illusion, and while initially their meetings aren’t necessarily antagonistic in nature, it does end up blossoming into something more substantial. For the most part, the story is fairly serviceable to the anime; it’s not Evangelion storytelling, but it doesn’t need to be. The story exists to give a coming of age tale for Cocona and Papika while allowing them to explore the surreal world of Pure Illusion, and with that in mind it works just fine. Overall, while the overarching plot is certainly a great story, the show is at its best when it’s just devoting an episode to Cocona and Papika in bizarre worlds, my personal favorite of which being episode 5, Pure Echo, which as of now may be my favorite episode of anime I’ve seen. I’m just a sucker for those kinds of stories, I guess.\\nMusic: The anime’s music really does an incredible job of setting the mood. The opening, Serendipity, is colorful and explosive while also just being a great song, setting the mood for the show perfectly. The ED, in contrast, Flip Flap Flip Flap, is a catchy and sweet tune accompanied by art reminiscent of Hansel and Gretel, further revealing the show’s themes as a coming of age story disguised as a romp through crazy lands. The episode-to-episode music isn’t weak, either; each track is quite memorable and accompanies the necessary scene quite well. Anime in general I feel is a medium that tends to handle music quite well, and Flip Flappers does an exceptional job here.\\nOverall, I don’t have much else to say besides reiterating what I already have. While this may be a review for an older show (sure, it’s not even five years old, but with so many anime coming out each season it certainly could be considered as such by today’s standards) but it really is worth a watch. Ultimately, Flip Flappers is a coming of age story about a shy girl and her brash friend, delving into surreal worlds right out of LCD trip accompanied by great music, the classic themes of friendship that permeates anime, and it all comes together very nicely.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd89a0fccd9693db812151d5eaa01c6a0'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'This anime is highly under rated in my opinion. It\\'s visually creative and avant-garde, yet its direction is neat and its story is coherent, original and appealing.\\nI\\'ve watched a lot of works that offers something interesting in visual art and rhythm, but disappointed me with a poor story telling and lack of character development.\\nThe first two episodes got me staying for the alice in wonderland flavor and its craziness, but I expected Papika to become quite annoying and the story to lacks in substance. I was pleasantly wrong and the two main characters benefit from more depth than you would expect from your average yuri-flavored\\nanime. So yes, Papika still is unrealistic in her never-ending energy and enthusiasm, but not incoherent nor shallow, which got me thinking those are different things. Especially when you know that she isn\\'t following an obscure organization for nothing like they would in madoka.\\nThe story itself has something of elfen lied, less dark yet as deep. It lets a bit of space for interpretation and imagination, which I appreciate and isn\\'t something you often see in anime where the story often has to be explicit. You know, those annoying, unnatural monologue a character would do to be sure you got it.\\nFor yuri fans, I\\'d definitely say this is a yuri anime. It does have the \\'we are lover but let say we are friends who likes each other so much\\', but it does not have the fan-service aspect to it that makes a poor, overseen and annoying equation. \"I touch your breast and lick your neck, but we are friends\". Ew. In Flip Flappers, love is in the air and it\\'s obvious enough to be satisfying. It doesn\\'t oversell it and that\\'s refreshing.\\nFor the downside, I\\'d definitely give a warning for loli fan-service, especially with one of the enemy that appears at the middle of the show. It doesn\\'t ruin it, but seeing 10 years old girls with overly sexual outfits really bugs me. That\\'s really the only issue I see with this anime, fortunately apart from the outfits and a few useless camera angles, it does not dive into creepiness.\\nSo if a mix between madoka, elfen lied and alice in wonderland with a very good and positive \"adventure time\" vibe sounds good to you, please give Flip Flappers a chance !', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '95d73406cbbf8295d6e33c06b321d52'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Flip Flappers is equal parts confusing and enchanting, but those are perhaps the only constants in a story that isn't sure what it wants to be.\\nThis underlying dissonance raises questions about narrative decisions as one undergoes the tumultuous journey: Why even introduce Nyunyu? Why was one episode randomly a drawn out mecha battle? Why dedicate so much time to building up and later revealing the backstory and ties of the shadowy, antagonistic organisation Asclepius if it is simply going to be cast aside as Mimi fills the role? What are the goals of these opposing organisations, anyway?\\nPerhaps none of that should matter, because the\\nfocus of Flip Flappers seems to lie in characters. This is an aspect the show does fairly well, with side characters like Yayaka, Iroha, Mimi, and Salt having remarkable stories. The biggest plot developments - conflicts and climaxes - involve character relationships that aren't necessarily tied to the bizarre, inexplicable premise. This, mercifully, allows some tangible semblance of progression.\\nTrue to form, Flip Flappers' highlights are inconsistent with the rest of the show. The slightly terrifying episode spent in a dark, looping version of the school is masterfully done. The tragic experiencing of Iroha's story, and witnessing the bittersweet result of changing her past, is the type of content I wish Flip Flappers had explored more frequently. Mimi, Papika, and Salt's past is also a strong highlight, but suffers from the fact that it comes as a result of a jarring change of focus late in the narrative.\\nThe art of Flip Flappers is its most effective facet. The fantastic worlds Cocona and Papika explore are beautifully crafted, and the entire show has an endearing hand-drawn sort of aesthetic to it. Combined with some comforting music, Flip Flappers very occasionally commands a unique and magical aesthetic that sadly gets lost among the suffocating amount of intrusive questions raised.\\nWhile its inconsistencies in everything from tone to pace do allow for its strongest points, Flip Flappers would have been better off picking one direction to fulfil. However, as much as it can feel like fumbling around in the dark, I would still say it is an experience worth taking to anyone who can see the light at the end and forget about the rest.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '41a782ab8aca987b636025479766e3c6'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"RE-POSTING this review since it got deleted (b/c Flip Flappers finished airing or whatever), but I´m just gonna leave eveything as it is, inculding my update after completion c:\\nI'm gonna be straight with you, there's about a 50/50 chance that you will either absolutely LOVE this anime, or it simply just isn't for you and you'll find it “meh” at best. I, for my part, happen to be one of those people who've been waiting YEARS for something like this. Fair enough, this has its very own reasons. So let me tell you about Flip Flappers:\\nIn its core I'd say this anime is about PERCEPTION\\nand furthermore, PERSPECTIVE. We follow the main characters, Cocona and Papika (I honestly love almost every character in it, the twins for example are fucking priceless), and they go on adventures together in a world they call “Pure Illusion”. Said Pure Illusion is meant to serve as “visualization of the mind” ...although it's not always so clear, whose mind it may be (this time).\\nThis is the basic idea behind it. I'm not going into detail here for fear of giving anything away, so let me do this review differently by starting with some “negative” aspects:\\n- ART: I get that a lot of people are probably thrown off by its look. This is exactly what happened to Madoka Magica. But while Madoka Magica did this to fool the audience in order to shock 'em later on, Flip Flappers looks like this because it needs to. If it weren't all girly, colorful and over-the-top, it wouldn't quite get its messages and its actual meaning across. Or at least not in the way it should be done. Which is why I think this style suits the anime perfectly, not least because it IS in fact a fantasy/sci-fi show, though, if you look closely, a coming of age story: very largely about self-discovery through overcoming fear, doubt and other obstacles. But before we're getting into spoiler territory I'm just gonna stop here~\\n- “FANSERVICE”: There's seemingly random bits of fanservice here and there. Or really just some weird scenes in general :'D For example episode 8, which suddenly increases in ridiculousness and made even me cringe a little - not because of the fanservice per se, rather because it's paired with such a cutesy look. But here's the thing! The reason why Flip Flappers gets away with it is because it's all within the context of 1. the respective world they're in and 2. the anime's true intentions. Meaning that, if you cringe, then that's because it WANTS you to. The show's aware of how you perceive it and might or might not do something to oppose that (for example when Hidaka takes off his glasses in ep 12!!! GOLD), and that's genius if you ask me.\\nBut talking about true intentions, I'm actually done with everything remotely negative, so here's EVERYTHING I TOTALLY LIKED about Flip Flappers:\\nWhen I finished the first couple of episodes, I had literally no idea what I had just watched. I thought it was something like Adventure Time, only with cute girls giving off some innocent yuri vibes, or rather, another yuribait and nothing more- but hoo boy, did I underestimate this show...!\\nReally, it seemed so random at first, nonetheless so incredibly FUN. The show throws so many ideas at you, one after the other, similar to FLCL some would say. And for that alone it would've gotten 8/10 already. But then...you suddenly get it. That one thing the story itself may be truly about :-o And never ever in my life would I have dreamed of an ANIME whose story would actually, genuinely cover this exact issue, all the while doing such a great job at it. In fact, it's done so smoothly, I didn't realize it myself the first 4-5 episodes in, despite me relating quite well to it all.\\nThis is a highly symbolic show with more than just one or two layers. It manages to criticize and “play” with genres and TV tropes, and it does this in such a charming way!!! It twists the tropes around, averts, subverts or underlines them. You've got your references to Alice in Wonderland, Sailor Moon, DBZ, Evangelion, Mad Max... Hell, even the KKK! Yes, the plot is certainly not flawless and it leaves some things unexplained.\\nBut still, nothing this anime does is unintentional. *Except maybe Nyunyu's entire existence lol. However, if you're able to read between the lines/look past the screen, there's gonna be one or another aha-effect for sure.\\n-\\nUPDATE:\\nOkay so after having seen all 13 episodes, I think I'll have to lower the score to a 9, but hear me out! It's not like the ending was bad, I liked it. It's just that the last three episodes or so seemed terribly underwhelming compared to the sheer awesomeness that is ep 1-10.\\nThere were some pacing problems, the animation worsened (b/c budget I guess) and it left some things unsaid which I feel should have been adressed very urgently. But you know what? I don't give a damn. Good show, adorable af ♥\\nThe ending could've turned into complete shit and I'd still love, love, love this anime 'cause I already got everything I wanted from it prior episode 10 tbh :') Ep 10-13 may as well could've never happened. But overall it's extremely rewatchable. I feel like I've missed a LOT of hints that may make me see the big picture even better once I rewatch it, so I will.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '61dc6ed8e940d321fb72dc8a007d73c7'}>,\n",

Thus, the “Sound” category refers to the Japanese voice actors and actresses.\\nFlip Flappers has to be one of my favourite anime series.\\nStory\\nThe story was good, 7/10. Each episode showed the journey Cocona and Papika going through the world of Pure Illusion in order to grab all the crystal shards. The story could have been approached a tiny bit better but I enjoyed the fact that it was not too cliché. The story appealed to me a lot, especially towards the end.\\nArt\\nThe art in my opinion was amazing. The art showing the\\ntransformation when Papika and Cocona shout out “Flip Flapping” has a shoujo vibe to it which I am still am trying to get used to. This is where I felt where it could have been cut down and had a bit more of a realistic vibe to it but yet again, this part is basically the cliché part where they transform and eventually beat the evil; nothing else. Thus, I suppose it does not need to be realistic and it is just my tastes that I need to change.\\nSound\\nThe voice actors/actresses were amazing.  It felt that the voices matched their characters. I did not notice the background music being awful. It blended in well with the certain scenes. The OP and EDs were not perfect but they were not all too bad.

The ED at the start does not really have a kicking explosive start but the chorus is where I decided to make the ED one of my favourite EDs.\\nCharacter\\nI felt that all the characters combined were well balanced. However, I felt that some characters did not react to situations in a realistic way. This anime, however, was not portrayed in a realistic way, but fiction. There were some antagonists were just there to be there, however, other antagonists did have motives. I also felt the supporting cast was perfect. They were not too bland. I generally hated the antagonists because of their evil nature. However, the antagonists needed to exist in order for this anime to be what it is or else their flip flapping adventures will become all for naught. (no antagonists mean they did not need to go on flip flapping adventures and just enjoy school life, making it become a slice of life anime instead.\\nEnjoyment\\nI overall think this anime is very enjoyable.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"In short : skip this and go watch something else. Seriously.\\nIn long : Rarely have I seen an anime that tries so hard and yet, never succeed, not even once.\\nFlip Flappers is an anime who wants to be cute, fun, creative, touching and a little bit sad. It tells the story of two young girls who each times, go live an adventure on an alternate and colorful world. With a synopsis like that, I should have love the show and yet, I ended up hating it.\\nThe story ?While I only seen 4 episodes (I couldn’t stomach more, even skiped parts of the fourth one),\\nthere is barely a story. Most of it, it's just Papika and Cocona in the real world, then on a alternate one, fight stuff, get theirs asses kicked, get power-up, win and goodbye. They try to tease bigger stuff but it’s not the main focus ; Flip Flappers wants to create « emotions », not complex storytelling. And that could work except but here, it doesn’t for a large number of reasons.\\nEach of the world is supposed to be an « hommage » to something else (Ghibli movies, Dragon Ball Z, Gurren Lagann, Hokuto No Ken, video games in general, etc...) and you’re supposed to be excited in each one of them but nope, they are too rushed and poorly conceived to make you care. Blink once and you will miss one.\\nAnd our protagonists, the ones that are supposed to make those adventures fun ? They are trash. I only remember their name because they spend so much time screaming them (I swear half of the dialogues are just them repeating over and over « Papika !!! » and « Cocona!!! »).\\nCocona is a bland, cold, bitchy and weak tsundere. She complains every two seconds, doesn’t have the guts to really stand up for anything and always act or react in the most annoying way possible. I think you’re supposed to forgive that because « Geeez, I don’t know what to do after highschool » and « being a teenager is harsh » but nope, she is still completely unlikeable and absolutely boring. She is also supposed to be smart but that’s only said once and never seen in action.\\nPapika isn’t much better : the energic and optimistic one who is basically a stalker. She stalks Cocona like crazy and try to force some bullshit yuri-romance with Cocona by touching her or sniffing her without the other consent. And look, I’m fine with yuri-pairing but when any pairing is so forced and creepy like this, I can’t help but hate it. Other than her obsession with Cocona ? Well she likes eating and sometimes she is super-strong and can beat up giants and sometimes you can take her out in one weak blow… Yeah that’s it. She has nothing for her except looking cute, being cheerful and wanting to be anywhere near Cocona.\\nAnd the rest of the cast you may gently ask, how are they ? Well, there are non-existent. Seriously.\\nOh sorry no, I forgot the robot. The one who is a pervert who loooooves to molest underage girls…\\nYes the show has a lot of awful, awful fan service who targets underaged girls. Want to see the two num nuts turned for no reason into furries ? Want to see a naked Cocona taking a shower? Want to see Cocona bite a metaphorical giant dick for no reason? Want to see the robot ejaculate because a naked little girl who is into BDSM hit him ? Too bad, because it’s here ! So yeah, the « cute » and « cheerful » side that the show tries to push doesn’t work with shit like that. The worst is when they try to make you sad like « oh no, Papika is dead » and then, BAM, a hidden gem hidden under the skirt of Cocona near her vag turns her into a super sayan and she saves the day ! Go kindly fuck yourself for that, Flip Flappers!\\nThe dialogues is also completely abysmal, with characters being stuck in repeating the same three-four lines each episodes. So any attempt at being funny, relevant or touching fails right away. Really, it's very rare to witness such poor dialogues.\\nAnd the action ? Bland because not only I’m not interested in the characters living them but also because they are just copying others better anime that I could be watching instead. Why watch a bland recreation of Dragon Ball Z when I can watch the original, who is infinitely much better ?\\nBut what about the art ? Every reviews talk about how wonderful and pretty and beautiful and creative this anime is ! Surely it’s his saving grace right ? NOPE. While the animation is decent and it’s clear that they worked on the D.A, it’s just decent/kinda good. It’s nothing mind blowing or impressive and there is nothing to make you care about it, unlike actual good anime. And it's funny to see that everytime there is a scene with Coco's Grandma, the budget drops by 60%.\\nIn the end, Flip Flappers fails. I can't recommand it, especially since there is so much better anime you could be watching instead of it who are actually fun adventure (with sometimes darker moments) like Space Dandy, Gurren Lagann or Little Witch Academia !\\nAlso, the op and ending are quite good, which is kinda sad when you realize they are better than the actual show.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7df22005b4658e17cbac09f01944fbac'}>,\n",

No question you should watch this show if you are even the slightest bit interested. I will attempt to convince you to watch it even if you aren't, but if all you wanted was an opinion on whether or not to watch the show than YES, WATCH IT. If you want to know why, read on!\\nArt: The most apparent thing about Flip Flappers from the get is that it is immediately visually striking. The art is sharp and colorful, with elements reminiscent of both\\nsomething beautiful and charming like a Miyazaki movie and something sharp and flashy like Kill la Kill or any other Trigger show really. It is worth watching for the visual alone.\\nCharacter: My other favorite aspect of the show. The cast isn't huge, but on the whole they are both very well developed for a show of this length and surprisingly full of pathos. They get put in situations that give you the feels. The two main characters, Papika (basically a super manic magical Little Orphan Annie) and Cocona (who pretends that she doesn't want to go on awesome adventures but also not so secretly LIVES FOR IT), are strong and sympathetic. The secondary characters are just as well-rounded, particularly Cocona's grumpy friend Yayaka. A particularly great episode explored the relationship of one of the less prominent side characters and an elderly friend who is beginning to show the signs of her advancing age. I cried a whole bunch. I had coincidentally also drank a whole bunch prior, but as mentioned above it hit me right in the feels. To say much about the characters themselves would be a spoiler, but I suspect you will like them all if you get to know them. Suffice it to say, some of the best character work in recent anime for me.\\nStory: In brief: two young girls, Cocona and Papika, find out that together that they can travel to Pure Illusion, which is essentially a series of fantastic and varied alternate universes. Craziness ensues.\\nWhile the story has been consistently uplifting and entertaining in equal measure, it could be said that it is also a bit confused. One of the particular selling point of this show for me is that each episode feels distinctly different in tone. While this does make for a very enjoyable watch, it does bounce around crazily between fun and sad and scary and cool a bit too quickly at times. The pacing is kind of frantic as well, but the nature of the show kind of supports this breakneck pace through the story. All in all I would say great but overambitious for 13 episodes.\\nSound: The opening song is great, really puts you in the mood to watch something flashy and fun which is what the show offers. The ending credits are quieter but SUPER cute, and shows us the girls navigating a more familiar and straightforward fairy tale.\\nOverall:\\nThe best part of Flip Flappers is that watching it feel like as much of an adventure as Cocona and Papika are having living it. It immerses you in its remarkably vibrant world and is consequently 100% worth your time, whoever you are.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '602a64c5265cd935ced71dfec6901b6c'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers is a story which struggles with its own identity. Simply put, it was most enjoyable when it didnt take itself seriously.\\nThe main premise is that 2 girls, Cocona and Papiko are to make multiple trips to an coexisting, yet elusive world called \\'Pure Illusion\\'.  The first 8 or so episodes really did a great job at unraveling this interesting world, and had me coming back to learn more.  Every episode there was a new idea of Pure Illusion- the haunted time loop house, the neo-city, and the monster filled iceland, were the most memorable for me. Ideas were getting tossed\\naround and it was a ton of fun. The interactions between the duo are cute and lighthearted.\\nThe art is also worth mentioning, the way this show handles artistic story telling, with a color palette ranging from vibrant to dull, is incredible. Action sequences are consistently fluid, with the use of flashy sakuga.\\nThe opening, Serendipity by ZAQ, embodies the whole mood of the show pretty straight on, with upbeat electronic music, beautiful fight scenes and with the beginning lines \"into the sky\"embodying the sense of adventure I truly felt when watching the first 9 or so episodes. But after that point, the opening just serves to remind us that the show has truly strayed away from what made it great in the first place.\\nThe story at some point, takes itself way too seriously. There is a hilarious lack of build up for the tension that arrives. The drama crashes in like a toddler who was testing the limits of a bike. It is rushed: the reveals, the explanations, the revelations, the resolutions. It never feels right. At some point, I was thinking \"what if they used their animation budget to make more episodes instead\". Everything good about the show I\\'ve said before, besides the art, just gets thrown out the window at some point. It leaves the viewer unsatisfied. Nothing feels complete, or established. The show becomes over ambitious- attempting a plot to wow the audience but leaves its former identity in the gutter and its viewers scratching their heads.\\nFlipflappers is the guy in elementary school who is working on a perfectly fine art piece, peeks at someone else\\'s, and ultimately ruins his own in an attempt to copy the piece he peeked at (aka me). Complicated plots are cool but there\\'s no reason to fix anything that\\'s not broken. I can\\'t bring myself to give this show that low of a mark, because I truly enjoy a big portion of the show.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers was an anime that got me excited about watching something on a weekly basis for the first time in the longest time. It seemed to be a show that had a lot to offer while putting up a deceivingly generic look. It had a mysterious way of presenting itself that subtly distinguished it from something we\\'ve seen too many times already. Sadly, the same can\\'t be said about how things turn out after about half way through.\\nThe show had a lot of quirks that would have you question if they are being subtle or just written poorly but it showed a lot of\\nsigns that they were self-aware of where it stands that were reassuring. I hate to use the word \"mature\" but Flip Flappers really seemed to have something more serious  with the themes that they were building up. A lot of the conflicts felt like they were leading somewhere important and \"mature\" to the point where ambiguity felt intentional. Even the aftercredit scenes that mysteriously never really got mentioned in the next episode felt like a narrative device that was going to be explained as an important part of the plot later on. A bit of a stretch, I know, but the show had me anticipate a lot of great things.\\nThe characters, while still within a reasonably generic archetype, felt like something that belonged within the given universe. They were shown in a way that had me accept that they could very well be living people. Believable personality is something that is missed quite often in anime and I think Flip Flappers is proof that decent writing can make generic characters interesting and maybe even seemingly complex. There\\'s something sincere about their overall behavior and makes a few cheesy scenes easily bearable. Though honestly, I\\'m just glad their personalities aren\\'t dedicated to being simply cute. Though, I would still argue they are cute.\\nEvery episode was a different experience especially with its surprising range of art direction. Overall quality seemed almost too good to be a regular TV show. They\\'re filled with meaningless but cool references done tastefully and a lot of clever composition and dynamic lighting. You may not agree with me when i say Cocona and Papika are interesting characters, but I don\\'t think many can deny that Flip Flappers had some impressive visuals. The change in mood for each episode is handled very well and makes it hard to guess what will happen next. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of impending struggle which made it exciting to see not just the new settings but also how the characters will react within it. They all seemed to work well for a show that sells itself as an episodic adventure.\\nHowever, things seem to go a bit shaky mid way and falls apart by the end. A lot of ideas and potential development seem to have dropped completely and everything just became extremely straight forward with a lot of underwhelming expositions that lack the same witty self-awareness it had before. Things that seemed important are either never discussed again or turned completely irrelevant. Characters start to literally explain the analogy  behind certain imagery within the show as if it had lost its faith in the viewer\\'s intelligence. Even the visuals are obviously worse than previous episodes for what were supposed to be some of the key moments of the show. As harsh it may sound, it turns into a show that really could have been any other show. Basically, it became something I originally avoided to watch Flip Flappers instead. A straight forward plot and a straight forward dialogue aren\\'t necessarily bad, but it\\'s definitely not what I kept watching Flip Flappers for.\\nThe drop in quality took me by surprise and disappointment. To summarize my experience with Flip Flappers, it went from being more like the ED song to being more like the OP song. There just seems to be a lot of thought put into the aesthetics to the ED while the OP is arguably generic and unfitting with the tone of the show. Ironically, the outro/preview music that comes after the ED is very catchy as well.\\nI really wanted to like Flip Flappers and I genuinely did up to about episode 7-8. The rest is up for debate. Maybe I was just over hyping and over analyzing things. Despite what I have said, I would still recommend watching Flip Flappers as the first half of the show is worth witnessing regardless of how you may feel about the other half.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e63a6e54c567dba1c04e3eb461891341'}>,\n",

Without further ado, let's get into my review on why this anime is that awesome.\\nStory (8/10)\\nThe story ain't anything special. It's just an adventure story between two girls. However, it is told in  an interesting way. There are episodes with their individual story but the story are still well told. Nevertheless it still kept me entertained.\\nArt and Animation (9/10)\\nThe visuals on this anime is just awesome. Each scene in this anime are well done. The art and animation are both unique. It doesn't follow the typical moe art style\\nnowadays. The animation sometimes reminds me of studio Trigger and it suits this anime pretty well. Don't believe me? Watch the PV. Granted that there are people who will not enjoy this art and animation style,  but personally I love it! The opening visuals did well in switching from the dark side to the bright side. The Ed theme is unique in using picture book style ending we normally see from Disney.\\nSound (8/10)\\nThe OP theme is catchy and the ED theme is cute to listen. The soundtracks are nothing special but each of the soundtracks is used in the correct scene. Never did a scene feels off because of its BGM.\\nCharacter (8/10)\\nThis is where the anime shines. Although the character quirks are cliched, however it still can't change the fact that the characters are well developed and interesting or enjoyable to look at, particularly our 2/3 main characters.  The relationship between Papika and Cocona are well developed and cute. None of the characters are annoying or unlikable, at least in my opinion. However, beside the main characters, the side characters just came off as bland and underdeveloped, nevertheless they are still likable characters.\\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\nI enjoyed this anime to its fullest because of the art, animation, OP and ED theme music and visuals, and also the characters. So I will definitely recommend this anime if you want an anime with a cute girl and girl relationship and also unique artstyle.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd027f03f851c737f356f71d04b382c04'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers. Yep, Flip Flappers. An anime about… something. With a name like that, Flip Flappers could be about a number of things. Most people would think it’s some sort of children’s show. But anime are children’s cartoons anyways, hurr durr. But, is that really so?\\nWell, this original anime by Studio 3Hz, which did Dimension W, that ran from October to right before the New Year of 2016 is a mash up of many genres. While MyAnimeList lists Flip Flappers as comedy, adventure, and sci-fi only; it is not actually so. I don’t even know why it’s being touted as a sci-fi anime. It’s not\\nsci-fi.\\nAnyways, this little 13 episode monomyth has basically got it all. Drama, yuri, comedy, horror, and you name it. Many people have resorted to describing Flip Flappers to be: “‘Inception’ met ‘FLCL’ and they both had gratuitous threesome sex with ‘Kodomo no Jikan’ in a liquor-fueled one night stand to produce this coming of age story about two middle school mahou shoujo probable closet lesbians”.\\nYeah, I was paraphrasing up there but I bet I caught your attention with that. If not, then, go read the MAL synopsis again.\\nIf you read the synopsis and thought that Flip Flappers sounds like any other mahou shoujo anime then you, sir, are horribly wrong.\\nLet’s first talk about the story.\\nBeing compared to Gainax’s actual magnum opus, that is FLCL and not that trash Neon Genesis Evangelion, one would expect a lot from Flip Flappers – especially in the department of ‘God, I have no idea what’s going on but I sure am loving this!’\\nWhile FLCL and Flip Flappers do share a lot things in many departments, the story is actually the place where they are the least similar.\\nFLCL had a distinct style of relaying its story that heavily relied on comedic exposition through visuals and saucy dialogue. Flip Flappers adopted style and slightly changed it into an episodic format friendly one. With each episode, the style metamorphosed just enough to let each individual episode come off as its own unique portion that subtly builds on the world of Flip Flappers through creative use of varying scenarios in the anime’s rather flip-floppy plot device (maybe location in this context?) called Pure Illusion.\\nTo be honest, this way of story telling is very confusing for viewers who aren’t used to noticing every teeny tiny detail in a scene. Bring subtitles into the picture and the viewer tends to miss out on even more details. That means to fully enjoy Flip Flappers, at least second watch should be essential for most. I know I will be rewatching it as I think I missed out on a major plot point. And, if I didn’t miss anything then Flip Flappers has a giant plot hole. Either way, not going go discuss that part due to fairness.\\nThis also shows the kind of issues prevalent with stories like the ones Flip Flappers and FLCL have.\\nAt times the pace might be really slow and then accelerate matters into full gear in five seconds tops. For an anime like this, that isn’t really a problem unless if the areas of snail-hood go into filler-like territory. This is, sadly, something Flip Flappers tends to do a lot. While Flip Flappers is director Kiyotaka Oshiyama’s first full-fledged work, he still has had a lot of practice with anime greats like Dennou Coil, the Fullmetal Alchemist movies, and the second season of Space Dandy. He did a good job with Flip Flappers but, honestly, he could have done a bit better.\\nOther than these points, Flip Flappers has an engaging story with a somewhat satisfying conclusion that’ll require you to fire up some neurons to actually understand the story. It’s nothing mind-blowing but you still get that warm feeling like the one you get right after an intriguing puzzle.\\nIn my opinion, the greatest thing about Flip Flappers’ story is that everything is in the anime itself. You won’t need to go online or harass your neighbor’s weeaboo pet dog for answers. In the case of FLCL, pretty much most of the story was almost entirely up to one’s imagination. That thing was cool chaos in animated form but it didn’t help itself by butchering it’s coherence.\\nNow onto the characters.\\nFor a coming of age story, the main character has to be great. Coconoa is not. She is just okay and that wouldn’t have been a problem if she wasn’t the worst character in the entire anime’s cast. Even the two twin villains, whose most recognizable trait is that they repeat the one another’s line, she routinely goes up against are more interesting that her. Maybe if Coconoa was just a bit less emo for her age then she would have been loads better. It’s true that she is empty and the anime is about her finding her identity but she wasn’t handled well in that regards. The biggest moment of these to not is when she blows fuses a couple of time for tiny reasons which is something her character isn’t supposed to do at all.\\nIn comparison, Papika was handled much better better. While she was still a tad one-dimensional at first, she quickly rose up to shine as having the most and best character development by the time the last episode hit the credits. Going into detail about Papika would require me to spoil the story but I will say that she should be paid closer attention than Coconoa. The same goes for the rest of the characters. While being heavy cardboard cutouts, they each had their own funky charm. Hell, the Goddamned pet rabbit of Coconoa had more personality than her.\\nNearing the end~\\nThe character designs and the fun use of many saturated colors provide the animation with kind of spunk and whimsical intensity a show like Flip Flappers need. The animators knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, they didn’t have the time to fully realize their goal so many corners had to be cut.\\nAs usual, I watched the anime in 1.5x playback speed and noticed a number of places where the color was missing and things like a character having an item in one hand and not having it in the next were very common. You shouldn’t be noticing things like these in visually heavy anime at increased playback speed. I’d be damned if I don’t say that at times the animation had many frames missing and it felt like I was watching at reduced speed…\\nThe background music was fun. I may snag the OST sometime soon. I didn’t like the OP. The ED was just perfect.\\nVoice acting is same as most stuff. The crazy scientist was the summit and all of the times Papika goes on her usual ‘coconoacoconoacoCOnoaCOcoNOAAAAAAA’ spiels was downright fucking annoying.\\nTo end, I’m going to say that Flip Flappers is a 7.5/10 in my book.\\nIgnore the rating and still watch it. It’s a fun ride I’d recommend to anyone. Except for lolicons.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5e5b1daafccd03337775f9911333d7c3'}>,\n",

I don\\'t usually watch this type of anime, and I\\'ve mostly watched slice of life in the past, but I was immediately hooked on this one. It\\'s a light-hearted, quirky, and often bizarre show. I was reminded of Alice in Wonderland in some ways.\\nThe story is a thumbs up. The fast pacing and different themes (mechas, magical girls, sci-fi, fantasy, fantastical) prevented it from ever being boring.  However, it could be a bit confusing at times. That\\'s understandable since it mostly takes place in other dimensions, so it has a surreal type of atmosphere. Even if\\nit seems odd, there was a purpose behind most of these themes. You might notice a common recurrence of 1) repetition/looping time and 2) a thine line between reality and the fantasy world called Pure Illusion, making it hard to tell what\\'s real. I\\'ll leave you to interpret the meaning yourself.\\nThe themes of the story deserve a seperate paragraph. Many negative reviews are criticizing it\\'s lack of a profound message, but that\\'s because they\\'re looking at it on a literal level. It\\'s a Bildungsroman. Cocona, the protagonist, learns an important lesson and matures. This is a difficultstory to write without it being cliche and generic. But through clever and interesting symbolism, they make a unique coming-of-age story.\\nI have no serious complaints about the soundtrack.  The OP and ED were really catchy, but the soundtrack throughout the show was nothing remarkable or memorable.\\nIf there were one reason to dislike Flip Flappers, it would be the characters. I\\'ll admit that Hidaka, or \"Mr. wacky science man\" as I call him, was a hilarious comic relief character. The protagonist was also a great dynamic character, as she should be in a coming-of-age story. The rest, however, were flat and cliche. You have Papika, the unrealistically hyper and optimistic girl, Yayaka, the misleadingly cold girl who isn\\'t honest about her feelings, Dr. Salt, the badass guy with a trench coat, and then there\\'\\'s Nyunyu. I don\\'t even know what Nyunyu is supposed to be. She\\'s a useless comic relief character who doesn\\'t really do anything but act cute. If you don\\'t mind slightly cliche characters, don\\'t be discouraged from watching Flip Flappers.\\nI have no complaints about the voice acting. All of their voices are in-character and they have good acting. I especially enjoyed the voice acting of Hidaka, the wacky science man I described earlier. He perfectly portrays the eccentric, hotheaded, loud, mad scientist and genuinely made me laugh almost every time he spoke.\\nA few parts seemed like subtle fan service but it\\'s debatable whether you could call it that. Some clean-minded people wouldn\\'t even notice it, and I had no trouble ignoring it.\\nNext up is the art. Thumbs up in that regard. It\\'s colorful and unique, with Ghibli-eqsue backgrounds. It\\'s impossible to be bored by an anime with such visually appealing art and visual effects. An observant viewer will notice many visual callbacks.\\nOverall, I loved Flip Flappers.

Viewers learn close to the minimal amount possible in order to still be able to follow along, and this is great because by the time you're starting to understand one aspect of the series, clues about other aspects appear,\\nkeeping the experience exciting and fresh. The character types are played well and consistently, with each being unique enough to have its place in the series. There aren't any monologues - everything is figured out by the viewers and by Cocona along the way. We're never stopped and forcibly pointed at an explanation point - the degree with which things make sense depends on how much effort you put in while watching the series, also meaning that you can chose what to care about and focus on, and simply ignore other aspects of the series, all while still enjoying it overall.\\nThe art is very good in almost all instances.\\nI liked the drawing style, which stayed consistent through most of the series.

This shift is very abrupt and the problem persists through the end of the series, ending on a bad note. We suddenly get a marathon of previously-seen environments - previously, all environments were new and interesting, only appearing once. We see foes come back and be tossed aside again without any depth being added. Any sense of relative power levels are gotten rid of and replaced with the in-poor-taste model of combat exchanges merely for effect. The viewer, for the first time, is forced to focus on plot aspects that get mundane quickly [and won't be mentioned because spoilers]. The fantastical scenes in the end are suddenly tacky and predictable instead of imaginative and wonderful. There was a hint of something deep at the very end, when they return to the real world, but other than that, the series just trips over itself and ends - even that final gimmick was done too hastily to have any profound effect.\\nOpportunity for cancel: No. I was surprised and saddened to see this series start off so great and then just fall over at the end. There are multiple ways this series could have ended, and I don't understand why ~that~ way was chosen. In addition to overall story planning falling, visual planning fell too.

The plot is all over the place and nothing makes sense, but if you look past that you might enjoy the show.\\nStory - 3:\\nI'm not going to try to dress this up, the plot is bad. In addition to either being far too complicated to reasonably explained or much too magical to try to put rules to the show focuses too much of its effort on delivering plot twists. I love plot twists, but in order for them to be meaningful the story has to make a reasonable amount of sense and\\nfollow through on what those plot twists mean to the story.

This means that some of the side characters just aren't as appealing, and characters who don't get much screen time in the beginning can seem bland until they get their development.\\nThe characters also suffer from some of the bad elements of the plot, making their relationships to each other get confusing.\\nEnjoyment - 8:\\nThis show was very fun, and I really enjoyed it (when it wasn't too caught up with the plot). There were times where I was hyped up for the fight, amazed by the worlds, and choked up by some of the sadder moments.

       "  <Document: {'content': '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\\nI rarely, if ever, flop over.\\nThat’s thanks to my favorite chair at home. Its leather has frayed. The base squeaks oddly. I place a soft blanket on the seat because it hurts my bottom otherwise. For anyone else, this chair looks and feels like junk. But it has always kept me from flopping unnecessarily.\\nFlip Flappers contains a lot of flipping and a lot of flapping. And, while it doesn’t have its own chair to sit on, it likewise doesn’t flop.\\nSTORY\\nFlip Flappers is a story about Cocona’s maturity from childhood and into adulthood.\\nA bold statement. Maybe\\nsome out there are saying to themselves right now, “Dude, what are you talkin’ about?”\\nWhen the anime begins, it treats the audience to something fun but not yet worthwhile. Papika and Cocona have a cute relationship. The worlds they visit are fascinating in their weirdness. And the death-defying stunts, the magical-girl transformations, and the silly-centered comedy provide many a scene that keep one’s attention.\\nYet, simultaneously, the makings of a subtler, more involved tale exist.\\nFor instance, the anime infrequently depicts famous trick drawings. Two faces stare at one another to outline an hourglass, and a young lady’s pose makes her seem much, much older.\\nIt also drops names that are too specific to be coincidental. Cocona’s rabbit’s name is Uexküll, a reference to Jakob von Uexküll who championed biosemiotics (the study of biological signs and symbols among species). Similarly, the evil organization chants Asclepius, a reference to the Greek god of medicine who was killed by Zeus for meddling with human immortality.\\nEven the worlds themselves, while often rooted in goofiness and genre, tell more than they let on. A strange plain of existence with only white walls and floors stretches towards infinity, and a desert considers BDSM and invigorating potatoes the norm.\\nSubconsciously (a relevant word for Flip Flappers if there ever was one), the anime feeds the audience these nuggets of intrigue. It slyly plants its threads, ingraining in the viewers the realization that the show is deep. Impressively so. A set of worlds and themes and ideas that cry out their avant-garde status.\\nTake episode six. Cocona and Papika enter a gate within Pure Illusion. Within this new realm, the two simultaneously exist as a young girl named Iro, living out her dichotomous lives as a child. On one side, the destructive family home harboring hate and cold. On the other side, a kind old lady welcomes and warms the soul. “Iro is Iro,” yet, when their neighbor succumbs to dementia and forgets their (shared) name, she wants to switch places with herself. While an impossibility, they at least remind their neighbor of their name – and accidentally alter reality as a consequence.\\nIn short, and in just this episode, Flip Flappers targets the duality of life, the self, and how memories shape one’s future. Pretty darn avant-garde.\\nCrazily enough, the anime takes this approach all the time. It doesn’t only dive into these dense themes offhandedly or sparingly. Indeed, it does so constantly, threading together larger themes on identity, thought, and perception.\\nIn episode seven, Cocona, having lost Papika, encounters different versions of her friend. A younger sister, a delinquent boy, a destruction-hungry senior classmate. After meeting with them and hanging out with them, she still concludes that these people aren’t really Papika, tying back to its theme on identity. The end even involves its theme on perception when it’s Papika who finds Cocona since, to her, she was the one who was lost.\\nIn episode eight, Cocona and Papika befriend a tiny scientist and defeat a massive alien. That scientist built that entire world, defying the odds stacked against his stature. In turn, Cocona and Papika (and Yayaka) do the same, obliterating their foe beyond recognition. Here, perceived capabilities are challenged as is one’s thoughts on the task at hand.\\nIn episode ten, specific plot details manifest as obscured truths. Papika unknowingly had amnesia. Yayaka pretended to be Cocona’s friend. Cocona’s “grandmother” lied to her. These thought-inspired revelations tear down Cocona’s perception of reality to the point that she loses her own identity.\\nThe show contains an uncanny number of instances related to these motifs on identity, thought, and perception. Too many to both list here and dismiss as mere straw grasping. However, the examples from above should illustrate that Flip Flappers explores its many themes in both interesting and varied ways even late into its run.\\nLike Pure Illusion, though, it goes deeper.\\nLooking at these threads, they interweave, but it’s not fully clear what bigger picture their knitting creates. Thankfully, Yayaka’s words in episode five start to reveal the grander interpretation behind Flip Flappers. She says, “Once you enter a Pure Illusion world, you’re influenced by its nature.”\\nThe most important word there? Influence. For Cocona, when she enters these otherworldly places filled with sweet snow and spider monsters, the environments influence her and the actions she takes. Often, she can’t stop herself from living out Iro’s life or squaring off against Papika as a mind-altering mask brainwashes her.\\nBut that’s more than being influenced; that sounds more like control.\\nIt happens almost every time Cocona enters Pure Illusion. The snowy forest controls her movement, carrying her along the backs of giant worms. The haunted mansion controls her time, sending her through the same loop again and again. The plain of nothingness controls her position, locking her away as Papika and Yayaka clash. Even the whole point of collecting the amorphous – controlling Pure Illusion – relies on the concept.\\nIdentity, thought, perception, control. Flip Flappers has enough thematic density here to hand out to every anime around it and then some. Yet, somehow, someway, it still doesn’t stop.\\nIn the final arc of the anime, Cocona’s mother Mimi (officially) arrives. She takes control of the situation and of her daughter, reinforcing its themes once again. More importantly, her arrival forces Cocona into the last major conflict of the story: breaking away from her mother.\\nCocona must leave her parents’ nest so to speak. Only the nest is a boat in fantasyland and her parents are a tabletop condiment and an aural receptor. Nevertheless, Cocona must finally mature.\\nAstoundingly, Flip Flappers has always followed this same story: Cocona growing up. Only it’s been framed in that avant-garde manner the entire time.\\nRemember those worlds in Pure Illusion? They also featured Cocona experiencing acts of a pubescent or sexual nature. Teething as a bunny. Getting all “hot and bothered” around the ghostly girls. Laying on a bed, in nothing else besides a black gown, next to the succubus form of Papika.\\nRemember those events in the regular world? She repeats many of her early actions when she has the same dream, puts on her clothes in the mirror, and heads off to school. That is, a routine which doesn’t define her. She fails to find purpose in her future, tagging along with Papika on their adventures just because it’s fun.\\nRemember those themes throughout the whole journey? Knowing one’s own identity is a part of maturing. Thinking more critically is a part of maturing. Understanding different perspectives is a part of maturing. Controlling one’s own fate is a part of maturing.\\nWhat at first seemed like just an anime involving a cute relationship, weird places, and action on occasion comes together as this smart, rich tale of a girl finally growing up. In other words, Flip Flappers becomes that bold statement: a story about Cocona’s maturity from childhood and into adulthood.\\nEven after all this dissection, two important points remain: the integrity of the narrative itself and the coherency of the connections made.\\nStarting with the first point, and being as fair as possible, the anime struggles on a basic writing level. It introduces an evil-organization subplot that the show not only fails to flesh out properly but also ends up meaning very little once Mimi appears as the main antagonist. The dialogue can also get quite bland as Cocona yells “Papika!” and Papika yells “Cocona!” at least a thousand times (give or take) each episode. And the flashbacks present in the final arc mistime both their pacing and their position.\\nAs for the second point, it’s worth wondering: Are these themes simply plopped next to each other to give the illusion that they form something more worthwhile? Well, yes and no. Yes, because the show does not go out of its way to bridge these separate ideas together. No, because the sheer number of examples is too large to ignore outright.\\nNo matter what, it’s clear that Flip Flappers tried to do something more, something different. If nothing else, that’s at least worth a commendation.\\nANIMATION\\nFlip Flappers maintains almost as much visual strength as it does thematic depth.\\nOn an artistic level, the anime does about as much as it can. It makes use of a lot of vibrant, varied colors to paint both Pure Illusion and the regular world with intrigue and finesse. A rainbow-esque bunny-morphing machine world. Orange sands that drape over dunes. Purples and pinks and blues light up a strobed techno city.\\nThe semi-soft style helps too, providing a calmness in its lush forests and underground laboratory. Attention to cinematography and shot composition make cuts like an upside-down reflection of Cocona off a puddle of water with a clocktower in the background the norm.\\nPlus, Flip Flappers takes advantage of its lighting. Be it Buu-chan’s lightbulb creating the silhouette of a skull around Papika and Cocona in episode one or how in episode two light fills the whole classroom save for the shadowy bar that covers Yayaka, the anime knows how to make the most out if its lighting.\\nIts character designs are likewise impressive due mostly to their complementary nature. Cocona and Papika are opposites (short and long hair, bright orange and depressed purple). Their magical-girl outfits are awesome, too, with their swapped color preferences, frilly black-white-pink dresses, and hard heels.\\nYayaka deserves a mention, too. She pins her bangs back, the dark-pink streaks that part her blonde hair serving as a reminder of her grey morality. Her black soldier suit with accompanying hookshots give that cool edge. But it’s her later eyepatch, cape, and belt (now with only one hookshot) that turns her into the nomad who abandoned her “home” to protect the only thing she holds dear and highlights her character development with but a single glance.\\nLike its storytelling, though, the subtler artistic choices give the show its strength. Looking at Papika and Cocona’s magical-girl designs once more, they rely heavily on a butterfly motif. Butterflies on their hair, chest, and hips are visible, and the yellow wings that grant them flight make them butterfly-esque, too. And how are butterflies created? Through metamorphosis. A fitting biological act given Cocona’s own metaphorical growth from a baby caterpillar to a full-fledged butterfly.\\nOther details are affected as well. When Papika saves Cocona from falling into the black hole in episode seven, their spaceship is none other than the concrete tube they regularly stay in. Yayaka and Cocona first met at a hospital waiting area, so how coincidental that their main place to hang out with one another is a nurse’s office. During the Iro-memory dive, Buu-chan makes an “appearance” as a yellow, four-wheeled cart that Papika drags along with her. And that big painting in the hallway of the school? It actually depicts Mimi floating in a pond after her (evil side’s) defeat – which is exactly what happens event-wise. As if fate was saying that Cocona will inevitably win and will thus eventually mature.\\nHow about one more example? During episode five, the anime recreates a famous scene from The Shining when Buu-chan wheels around a corner and sees the evil twins down the corridor. Another clever inclusion, considering the premise of this famous horror film (warped reality through insanity).\\nCHARACTERS\\nFlip Flappers is undoubtedly Cocona’s story, but her two best friends make all the difference.\\nCocona starts off in regular anime fashion. After taking some mock exams at her cram school and later speaking with her advisors, she’s unsure of what path she wishes to follow. A fair spot for any middle-school-almost-high-school teenager to be in.\\nIn strolls Papika. Or rather, she glides in, whisking Cocona away to Pure Illusion where she experiences a world she has never known. At first, she’s apprehensive. It’s too weird and too dangerous, so she wants no part in something that she feels will inevitably bring harm. Yet she has fun. A concept she’s not necessarily used to as she follows the same routines at home and continues to lack confidence in her own future.\\nBoth worlds challenge Cocona. Her dreams control her mind. Her indecisiveness controls her identity. Pure Illusion controls her perception. From very early on (albeit avant-garde), the anime centers Cocona on those important themes. She also starts to try new outlets and learn more about herself in the process. Yet, as she hesitates to reenter the realm, and her actions influence the real world, Cocona ponders whether she even should be here. Yayaka’s constant warnings don’t help matters either.\\nThankfully, Cocona has Papika.\\nPapika is technically the deuteragonist of Flip Flappers, but her role is less main protagonist and more ultimate supporter. And she’s darn good at supporting, too. Papika is cheerful. Simple-minded yet sincere. She brims with energy and happiness, letting nothing demotivate her drive to enjoy life and all its wonders. Indeed, that’s arguably her greatest strength: always moving forward and refusing to stop and wait. She finds it difficult to say complicated words, and she has a hankering for food (green bunnies too). But she always has Cocona on her mind.\\nThat’s something regularly seen. In Pure Illusion, Papika’s often the one who pushes Cocona along, grabs her by the hand, or otherwise encourages her to go beyond. She wants to be there for Cocona no matter what, for she sees her as nothing less than her most cherished companion.\\nTheir foil setup is a classic one – timid, mature character paired with the outgoing, silly one – but it works. Papika makes up for Cocona’s inability to have confidence in herself, and Cocona keeps Papika reeled in as best she can. While the two don’t always get along, their friendship blossoms as they Flip Flap into their magical-girl alter-egos and overcome the different dangers of Pure Illusion together.\\nUnfortunately, Papika can’t do everything for Cocona. On the deserted island, Cocona finds herself way too far in over her head. And the different worlds see her controlled by bunny teeth and helmets and ghastly girls.\\nIt also doesn’t help that Papika starts to regain her memories, and, in doing so, she starts to confuse Cocona for somebody called Mimi. Cocona gets upset at Papika for not being able to tell the difference, but they don’t outright have a falling out. At least not until Papika fully unveils her backstory. At which point Cocona says those dreaded three words: “I hate you.”\\nAll the while, the last important character – arguably the strongest in the anime – has made several appearances up to this point. Her name? Yayaka.\\nFlip Flappers characterizes Yayaka as a semi-delinquent who likes playing hooky and hanging out in the nurse’s office more than she does thinking honestly about her next place of education. However, she’s not completely without care. She’s close with Cocona, grabbing her in worry and going so far as to note how soft her friend tends to be.\\nYayaka isn’t the same, and she says about as much on more than one occasion. “My mindset is totally unlike yours.” When she reveals that she’s working for the other side, the evil organization, she backs up her claim well enough.\\nShe steals the amorphous gems when she can. She does not get along with Papika whatsoever. She continues to follow orders from her higher-ups. Nevertheless, Yayaka doesn’t drop her friendship with Cocona. She warns her when she can. She also gives her advice and even helps sparingly. Despite all the bad she’s associated with, Yayaka still demonstrates good. Moral mixing that easily adds dimensionality to her character.\\nHer motives remain mostly a mystery in the first half of the anime, but, come the second half, the audience learns more about her and her situation. Her organization disapproves of her constant doting on and laxness with Cocona, stripping her of certain privileges and threatening her with removal altogether. And, through certain flashbacks, the show shows Yayaka befriending Cocona from a young age – to get close to her for the organization and thus earning her a “home.”\\nThe climax of her conflict occurs in episode nine where she wages war. War against Papika, the girl who has “stolen” her own best friend, and herself, the girl who must choose what matters most. After everything, she shields Cocona with her body, demonstrating as clearly as possible the choice she has made.\\nYes, Yayaka lied to Cocona. She admits that. But that doesn’t mean Yayaka and her had nothing between them. Indeed, Yayaka knows deep down that the time she has spent with Cocona has affected her. Changed her mindset to one that’s perhaps not quite unlike hers.\\nThus, she does what she can to prove it. She helps Papika rescue Cocona as the enemy invades Salt’s laboratory. Later, she makes up with Papika, rekindling her motivation in the process. And together they chase after Mimi to save Cocona within Pure Illusion because that’s what friends do.\\nThe ultimate proof of her full development writing-wise comes when she finally, successfully, officially Flip Flaps for the very first time. She cries out what’s nestled wholly in her heart: that Cocona is the most important thing in her life. It’s a strong moment not only because of the cool action sequence that follows her transformation but also because it definitively marks a satisfying conclusion to her entire character arc.\\nAnd so it is that Papika and Yayaka save Cocona. One could argue that it’s a “the power of friendship” type deal. However, given the focus on Cocona’s maturity within Flip Flappers, it’s most likely more than that.\\nBecoming an independent person is important for personal growth. But that doesn’t mean one can do it all by himself or herself. Just as Pure Illusion requires partners to enter together, so it is that Cocona needed her best friends to finally escape from the control that trapped her, to finally allow her to mature into the person she could always be.\\nAs for the other, forgotten side characters – Salt, the twins Yuyu and Toto, Professor Hidaka – they unfortunately remain rather extraneous throughout most of the season. They’re either given too little to mean much to the larger story or they receive almost nothing at all. Salt’s growth comes through small snippets of flashback. The twins eventually look up to Yayaka. Hidaka is little else besides a mad (and hysterical) scientist.\\nArguably, these characters get the attention proportionate to their importance. After all, the anime is really about Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. Meaning, it’s fair that the majority of the extra side characters simply don’t matter in the long run.\\nTo that end, Flip Flappers builds its trio in strong fashion. They aren’t as impressive as its narrative, and they’re not exactly incredible on both an individual and group basis. But the show provides them with enough traits, moments, and changes to mark their characters as notable successes.\\nSOUND\\nIt almost doesn’t need to be said: the ending track of Flip Flappers wins in the music department. In fact, one could argue that it’s the best trait of the entire show. Indeed, even the anime plays it one last time following the final scene rather than letting said scene lead the audience out.\\nWhat makes it so strong? Mostly the composition itself. The rising and falling tones. The whispering “Flip” and “Flap,” one for each ear. The fairytale instrumental work. Not to mention how the whimsical nature of the piece fits Pure Illusion quite well, and how the fun, almost playful approach invites its listeners to both bob their heads and sing along to its catchiness. While not as deep as the story of Flip Flappers itself, the ED is arguably the show’s most memorable facet.\\nThe opening track and the rest of the original soundtrack don’t reach anywhere near the same level as the ED, but they as well have their strengths.\\nThe OP contrasts with the ED, incorporating a lot of techno beats and effects to create an empowering song. Its second half is particularly awesome. Rousing vocals, background cheers, and slight forays into lighter chimes pump the audience up for what’s about to go down.\\nAs for the OST, it contains a wide array of different musical options. Cocona and Papika transform into their magical-girl selves through a dainty tune replete with fairy sounds and twinkling changes. A slow piano piece rings out as worry takes over Cocona’s heart in the cold and the trees. An acoustic-guitar version accompanies her bittersweet realization that Iro didn’t keep her promise. A happy tune with woodwind instruments and light bongos plays as Papika cheers up Cocona when she feels “empty.”\\nVoice acting doesn’t stand out as much as the music does, but the more niche performances certainly do. Michiyo Murase as Uexküll the bunny rabbit waggles her tongue to hilarity. Kazuyuki Okitsu as Buu-chan sputters his name with determination. And the creepy “qrE3TInqs” girls of the haunted school make the audience want to close out the video right then and there from fright.\\nENJOYMENT\\nI am a fan of esoteric, artsy stories – and the same holds true for this tale too.\\nWhile watching the show, I found myself having fun. Papika shouting about unfairness or running around without a care in the world made me laugh. I liked the action, too, especially when they started to transform into magical girls more often. But the real fun with these kinds of shows comes afterwards. All the digging and research and interpretations.\\nThe further I investigated the anime, the more impressed I became as I found more throughputs, layering, and importance. I wasn’t expecting it to connect an idea of control throughout itself. The overall purpose of the story – to showcase Cocona’s maturity – is also something that surprised me as it all came together. Even the worlds of Pure Illusion. Their symbolism, settings, and similarities were far more involved than I initially thought.\\nI will say, I’m in agreement with a sizeable portion of the community: execution worsens during the last quarter of its run. The rushed pacing, to cram everything before it ends, doesn’t make the transition go smoothly. The flashbacks are lame in their construction, too. And, while petty, Iro’s neighbor’s vocal performance got on my nerves.\\nEven so, Mimi’s involvement adds more layers to the already thick thematic sandwich the show offers to its audience in restaurant style. (But I still don’t like the old lady’s voice.)\\nI do wish the show didn’t get repetitive with its worlds. Two of their visits were just their own school and town (the scary episode and the multiple-Papika-personality episode), and the final arc simply reuses the other worlds that were already in rotation. Still, I can’t be too hard on it. Given everything else it set out to do and accomplished, I’m willing to give the show some leeway.\\nAnd my favorite part of the entire anime? Toto, with a blank expression on his face, spinning wildly in the visuals of the OP. It made me chuckle and say “Whee!” every time without fail.\\nFlip Flappers doesn’t do everything right, but its drive for something bigger and better and beyond leaves a lasting impression. Robust thematic depth. Careful artistic choices. A stellar ending track. In the end, who needs a chair when one can fly so high?\\nSUMMARY\\nStory: Great, small pacing problems and unimportant subplots aside, this avant-garde narrative about the growth and maturity of a young girl, supported by thematic density through identity, thought, perception, and control, provide a tale that, like Pure Illusion, is more than meets the eye\\nAnimation: Great, color, lighting, and artistry abound, but it’s once again the subtle details that scream the loudest\\nCharacters: Good, Yayaka goes through a satisfying character arc, Papika brings the support, and the two work with Cocona to help her mature, but the lack of attention given to almost all the side cast cannot be dismissed\\nSound: Good, good OP, great ED, good OST, okay VA performances\\nEnjoyment: Good, esoteric experiences are often the most interesting\\nFinal Score: 8/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '59e7d325055477c05cb70ff2bc47aca7'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Flip Flappers feels like a show influenced by Madoka Magica, and you would definitely enjoy it if you loved Madoka. It's a magical girl show that goes in unexpected directions, with a platonic romance at its center.\\nThe thing that makes Flip Flappers enjoyable no matter your preference in anime is its aesthetic. It's a beautiful-looking, smoothly-animated show with lots of exciting action scenes. The characters visit various fantastical parallel worlds, and the art direction really shines through here. Every episode is a visual feast, even indulging in spoofs of genres like horror or mecha. The main cast's voice acting is great, not so much in\\nthe sense that it transmits incredible emotion, but rather in that it really feels like they embody their characters. The quality of sound design in general complements this.\\nSo Flip Flappers is a wonderfully-produced show from a relatively unknown studio, which is already a win and should have won them a bigger audience. Aside from the unseemly amount of shameless fanservice in a show about middle-school girls, my only real problem with Flip Flappers is its story. It's not that it doesn't make sense--it does, but you have to be willing to yield to the show's dream-logic a bit. What really bothers me is that the story doesn't proceed in an organic way at all. Characters simply go along with unusual situations without asking questions; important revelations fall flat because characters aren't given the time to react to them. The story doesn't really begin to take shape until the second half of the series, and by then I think there wasn't enough time to get through the whole thing. From then on, the plot becomes really predictable and secondary to the fantastic visuals.\\nStill, Flip Flappers has inherently likable characters populating an amazing world, and it should at least entertain just about anyone who likes anime. The show also has a sense of humor about itself; the preview for the final episode tricks viewers into believing that they ran out of animation budget and it's going to be an audio-only, Evangelion-style affair. It's a very fun show, definitely more fun than Madoka in its first episodes. It just becomes a little underwhelming towards the end.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3932571ba9c54868542086cc5dd88126'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'When I watched this series, I did so with skepticism.  had been introduced to the world of anime by friends who frequented phrases like, \"You\\'ll like it, but it\\'s very sexual and weird.\" and \"Sometimes, I\\'m embarrassed to tell other people I like to watch this stuff!\" Of course, this absolutely shocked me. I had grown up believing anime was a lot about large scale, epic fights, and messages of friendship and perserverance. I had been introduced to what some call \"Shōnen.\" The shows intended to fill the hungry hearts of young kids with empowerment! \"Yeah! anime\\'s the coolest! I love Naruto!\" As I\\ngrew up, I began to think it was cringey, that I was weird for holding on to these Shōnen shows. I hadn\\'t explored much else of anime, I was worried and intimidated by my friends comments. There were some shows I held on to however. I fondly remember watching some of \"K-On\" and the \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\" was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Just as unfortunately as the fact that these nostalgic anime aren\\'t on this site, I unfortunately did not want to venture much further past them. Flip Flappers seemed like a simple, and charming show to me. I was entranced by the animation and the creativity of the setting (known as Pure Illusion) and I was willing to give the site a shot! So I signed up for a free trial and entered into the world of Cocona and Papika. The strong, nostalgic feelings reminded me of my own life, and the shows themes of family and being yourself are strong. At least that\\'s part of what I got from it. That\\'s what some people want to hear, isn\\'t it? How do I talk about the show without spoiling it? I want the people to have the same fresh experience as me, but I don\\'t know how to sell it! I spent the review proving how much I don\\'t know, but I don\\'t know how to tell you what I do. Let\\'s start like this. Flip Flappers made me love anime. It began cute and charming, and it changed into something I could not stop watching. It\\'s my favorite anime of this season, and possibly my favorite ever. I sit here, writing this review, and I still feel there\\'s so much more I want to say. But I want to get these feelings out of my head and ride on the melancholic, yet incredibly, powerfully, satisfied it\\'s ending made me feel. I hope one day I may get to talk about the show more, but for now I just have to push it and shove it onto you like a weirdo who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s typing. I am a safe person. I tend to love the consensus masterpieces, but FF gave me a lot more than that. It made me interested in anime again. If there\\'s anything I do agree with the consensus on though, it\\'s that episode 3 was my favorite. I think there\\'s something more personal and hard to explain about why I like the show so much.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers is intended to be a take on the traditional \"magical girl\" genre. That said, those familiar with such themes will most definitely be thrown through a loop, at least for the first 8 episodes or so.\\nCocona is a middle schooler with a seemingly unexplained past, who is met by the eccentric girl, Papika. Papika brings Cocona through to Pure Illusion, a world with seemingly limitless potential, in order to find fragments said to grant wishes. This leads to the two girls going on a grand adventure with many interesting experiences\\nThis Anime could have very well been a solid 9\\nfor me, however, the later episodes let me down thoroughly, making me hover between a 7 and 8. I\\'ll go over what pushed me to go with 8 later, but let\\'s start with the issues.\\nIf you were unaware, around episode 7, the lead scriptwriter of the show left. Whether they were removed or left of their own accord, I can\\'t say, but what I can say is that this change definitely feels like it comes off in episodes 8 - 13.\\nIt\\'s hard to tell how much of the story was planned out to end the way it did, as there have been reports some episodes being completely different from how they were originally planned. Regardless, in my opinion, the last 4 episodes of this show end up being incredibly disappointing. It\\'s a huge shift from seemingly subtle storytelling and character building to shoving as much dialogue and exposition into every final episode as possible, almost as if they realised they wouldn\\'t have enough time to fit their overly convoluted plot into a 13 episode season.\\nAnd it really didn\\'t need to be so complicated. They just as easily could have closed off the series with an equally subdued ending as the rest of the story and it would have been absolutely fine. I\\'m guessing budget is a big issue, and it definitely shows in the final episodes. However, they still manage to make relatively interesting settings as a backdrop to the underwhelming exposition.\\nSo after all that, why would I consider giving this show an 8? It\\'s somewhat hard to explain. Throughout those first 8 or so episodes, I really felt connected with the characters and the adventure. Travelling through so many interesting settings and slowly understanding the story of each episode was really a fantastic journey. Including the fact that episodes 5 and 6 were up there with my favourite episodes of any anime I\\'ve watched.\\nI honestly wish I could recommend just watching the first 8 episodes of this anime, but the entire lack of closure you get viewing up that point would ruin the experience. However, this is one anime I would be very happy to re-watch, now that I have that closure and I don\\'t even have to worry about the later episodes.\\nRegardless, if you\\'re willing to go through half of a really good anime and fine through wading through half of a not so great anime, I would highly recommend for you to watch Flip Flappers.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bf091f9c7f83aeb0afd9cd6b2e1f94a2'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Throughout my time of watching various anime, I’ve occasionally come across series that, while they may not have been popular (or no longer talked about), I found them to be legitimately good despite the lack of a real following. People commonly refer to these types of series as a “hidden gem”. This is a term that I find reflects Flip Flappers perfectly.\\nThe story primarily follows Cocona, a girl who is unsure about her future and who’s reluctant to make choices for fear that she’ll come to regret them later on. One day, on her way to school, she has a chance encounter and meets Papika,\\na very tomboyish and action-oriented girl who takes her hand and leads her on an adventure into a fantasy world known as Pure Illusion, where the two girls are tasked with finding magical stones known as “amorphous” that are said to grant wishes. Their adventure takes them through multiple dreamlike worlds on their hunt for the amorphous’, where they face fellow hunters, dastardly villains, colossal monsters, and overcome their own pasts and personal adversities.\\nStory:\\nWhile I personally think that the story in Flip Flappers is wonderful, I find the execution to be...quite confusing. There were times when I’d be watching an episode and would have absolutely no idea as to what was going on. It’s not that the story is badly written, per se, it’s just that many important details about the plot, it’s characters, and the world of Pure Illusion are explained in small details that can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention. There were multiple times while watching this series that I’d have to pause or even rewatch a scene to understand what was going on. Also, while it should be obvious at this point, this anime doesn’t spoon feed you the story, there will be times when you’ll actually have to think about how certain story elements work, or connect the dots from the dialogues, since some things are not expressly explained, but can be deduced from the bits of information that they do give you. While it can be confusing, I certainly don’t mind this form of storytelling.\\nI also find it worth mentioning that this series does indeed contain some fanservice and yuri undertones. However, since both are fairly low-key and not really prominent, I didn’t find either to be particularly offensive in any way. It’s just something that I wanted to point out for people (like myself) who are put off by absurd amounts of fanservice. Luckily, for Flip Flappers, it’s nothing over-the-top.\\nCharacters:\\nThe key characters have a reasonable amount of depth that gives each of them their own unique personality. What I found most enjoyable about the characters is how their friendships were portrayed and developed. At first, Cocona’s friendship with Papika (her partner in crim-I mean adventuring) and Yayaka (her classmate) seem to take a lighthearted and predetermined route. However, throughout the series, they each have to fight and overcome their own personal challenges and feelings to retain and save their friendships with one another, which is an aspect that I personally appreciated seeing.\\nArt, Sound and Animation:\\nThe art is perhaps one aspect of Flip Flappers that I enjoyed most. It’s beautiful, vibrant, and has an almost dreamlike quality to it that I found myself enjoying more times than once. Some of the background art is simply wonderful and almost reminds me of a couple of Studio Ghibli’s works, as well. In fact, there’s a few background scenes which would make wonderful desktop or smartphone wallpapers.\\nI think that the OP and ED songs fit the series well. I especially enjoyed the latter, finding myself humming the song on more than one occasion. Frankly, I didn’t really notice the OST all that much, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It had the right tracks fitting for the scenes in question and...that’s about it.\\nThe animation in this series is truly unique and worth mentioning. At times the animation resembles works from studio Trigger or even Gainax (especially during the early combat scenes), giving the animation a very unique quality that I don’t think I’ve encountered in another anime. I do think that it’s also important to note that, while the animation was fantastic for the first part of the series, I did notice that the overall quality seemed to diminish in the latter episodes, which could be attributed to the change in studios midway through the series. While it still looked great, I noticed that in the more action oriented scenes, the animation had certainly been turned down a notch.\\nAlthough I came into this series with next to nothing in the way of expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the end. With the myriad of seasonal anime that fall into either blatant mediocrity or in the realm of “it’s OK”, I can confidently say that this falls into neither of those categories. Despite the few small problems that I had with this series, I still give Flip Flappers a 9/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy anime that doesn’t hold your hand or spoonfeed you the story.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5198e999f6df1ddd93614a16f410fbbc'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Flip Flappers: One of the few anime I have watched where every episode, I say, \"wow.....\" and wondered what was going to happen next.\\nStory: 6/10\\nThe story follows two girls, Cocona and Papika, and their journeys through Pure Illusion. It is a magical girl anime where they transform into the \"Flip Flappers,\" but it is not the magical girl element that is the focus, but the common themes associated with the genre, with friendship as the main theme. The girl\\'s friendship is tested time and time again, and every time they go to Pure Illlusion, we learn more about their and their bond.\\nUnfortunately, the\\nmain storyline suffers from being quite subtle. For an anime with heavy imagery, it favors having the audience put everything together over keeping a straight storyline. The main plot isn\\'t introduced until the second half, and many of the characters are put in the background in favor of the main three characters, Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. I felt that characters such as the twins and the \"evil organization\" had little time to develop and play any sort of significant role in the story.\\nCharacter: 5/10\\nI loved the characters, but I wished we got to know more about the other characters in the Flip Flapper organization. Let me break the main ones down for you though:\\nCocona: The main character. She\\'s rational, afraid of making decisions, and indecisive. She has a kind heart and wants to do the right thing.\\nPapika: Childish, loves adventuring, and has no sense danger. Her spunkiness is her charm and biggest flaw.\\nYayaka: Strong-willed, determined, and knows exactly what she wants. She\\'ll do anything to feel like she belongs.\\nI loved how the characters were all foils of each other, with Papika being incredibly childish, and Yayaka being the most adultlike, and Cocona somewhere in the middle. However, they all struggle with their feelings and conflicted between right and wrong, and we watch the characters grow through the story, which was very charming.\\nHowever, all the other characters has little to no development, but generic character arctypes. There\\'s the crazy scientist, the artist, and that one generic guy in a Ku Klux Klan hat who does nothing but pretend to play an important role in the story.\\nAnd then there\\'s the Pure Illusion characters. Since the girls travel to a different world every episode, these characters received almost no love at all after their episode. (If you\\'ve watched the show, I wanted to learn more about \"Pops,\" the scientist of Pure Illusion. He was so cool!)\\nSound: 9/10\\nI loved the soundtrack to this anime. It was fun, bubbly, and fit the show. The opening is incredibly catchy, and I never skipped it. The ending gave me goosebumps after the episodes.\\nArt: 9/10\\nThis show deserves an award. I loved the colors, from Cocona and Papika having contrasting hair colors to the fun, craziness of Pure Illusion.\\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\nJust because I felt the other characters weren\\'t developed doesn\\'t mean I didn\\'t enjoy this ride. While I believe the story suffers, this show is incredibly fun to watch. There\\'s an episode where they even go Power Rangers style and make a big robot to save the day.\\nEach individual episode has its own world, and I enjoyed the interactions the girls had with the citizens of Pure Illusion.\\nOverall, this show is worth a watch if like shows like Madoka Magica, or are interested in Magic Girl in general. It has a nice spin on the genre, and I highly recommend it for its strengths.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ff40a2799257cf1a88b02161639ae59a'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'First off, im going to start by saying that for the first time i watched this anime, i got pretty much surprised. i decided to watch this just out of curiosity and didn\\'t even expect anything from it. but the first episode actually surprised the hell out of me. and i will give my reasons as of why, and what surprised me.\\nThe story to be honest, it looks kinda targeted for kids to me but it feels not at the same time. there is a gap between those two and that\\'s where the story is. i said it\\'s not targeted for kids or at least\\nteens at the same time cause of the combination with the animation. i feel like the animation made it so that person above, let\\'s say 15 or 19 can enjoy this show too. And what makes the story looks different is because of the serious element in the story itself. usually, story that only targeted for kinds, well you know, it\\'s just a normal story. more like fairy tale story. with out any serious problem or complicated problems but Flip flappers is actually have some of them. especially regarding the main character. even i got a bit surprised when they revealed everything about the main character backstory. so, i think overall, the story is really well made. although, i think the conclusion isn\\'t really that impressive. it\\'s just a normal ending imo. i only got impressed with the plot revelation. from that point, i think the show got really serious and pretty deep.\\nbut i must say, the story has one mistakes. they didn\\'t put any details about the supernatural elements. maybe more like world building ? i kinda feel like, with not doing that, there are some people who want to know about it so badly, but to me, regardless, i think it\\'s great to not putting more details about it. so that it can gives a mystery elements from the story. and it will remain as a mystery even the story ends. i like that kind of story so i love it a lot.\\nThe character. i think the character are amusing and interesting. when it comes to character. i don\\'t really know much what to talks about it tbh. one thing that i must say, it\\'s so catchy to the story and animation. overall, it think it has a very good characters.\\nSound! just loved to the opening and ending song a lot. i didn\\'t pay a lot more attention with the soundtrack tho cause i was pretty serious with the story xD but the opening and ending song are really the best imo. catchy with the show too.\\nThe animation and character design. This one, is one of the thing which surprised me a lot from flip flappers. i didn\\'t expect, a single tiny bit, that the animation would looked like what usually studio trigger or gainax made. this is one of the thing which got me excited with this show too. the animation looked awsome. this is rare tbh to me. this kind of show, having the kind of animation which is on the same level like one punch man. it isn\\'t the character design but the animation. as for the character design, it\\'s more like rough imo, but in a good way. which when they made it into an action scene, they just nailed it a lot.\\nSo, from overall view, this anime is a rare one from 2016. the story was really interesting and always get me thinking \"what the fuck is going on?\" and made me want to watch more and want to know what\\'s next. moreover, the animation always made me excited. they start the show with a good song and end it with a pretty nice song too. really like the set up. great show overall. 9/10\\nthis show felt like a disney show to me xD\\ngeneric ? full of cliche ? cgdct ? yuri ? at first you will think like that but when they gave you the backstory or revealed everything, that view will changed i think. only it just looks like magical girls but they don\\'t even state that it\\'s a magical girl so...yeah...i think they are using it to look more entertaining and i think they nailed it. at least to me tho. i don\\'t know about everyone.\\nif you are searching for new stuff, i will recommend this show.\\nHope my review can be helpful to you.\\nThanks.

There wasn't many series I wanted to watch during fall, and because the amount of animes in Summer that failed to live up to the hype, I didn't have any shows I missed to catch up on. However after seeing a little bit of Flip Flappers artwork I decided it might be worth a shot.\\nWhen I started watching Flip Flappers I was impressed by the visuals but nothing else really caught my attention right away. However when a few episodes later I started to enjoy the missions they went\\non more and more, Cocona and Papika became more lovable with every episode and by the end of the anime I wanted nothing more than for them to be happy. The artwork was some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen. The amount of detail that went into every scene was amazing and I often found myself re-watching scenes just so I could truly enjoy the artwork. This one's a minor not the biggest reason to watch the anime, but for some reason I found that the ED was catchy, cute and all around fun song to end the episode with... Definitely take a listen to the ED instead of just skipping to the next episode if you decide to watch Flip Flappers.\\nThe only real problems I had with Flip Flappers was the poor ending and little character development the characters received. The ending felt rushed and after finishing it I found myself with more questions with answers. This is to be expected for a 12 episode anime as closing out an anime's entire plot that fast can sometimes be quite difficult. Also being a 12 part series, it's pretty hard to give every character the development they need. However with that being said, after ending the series we know almost nothing about the Twins, Toto and Yuyu. We met the characters around the first few starting episodes, yet we learned almost nothing about them. By the end of the anime I couldn't recall anything about either of the characters. Also this is more a personal thing but I wish they talked more about what happened to Iroha Irodori, her whole life was changed from Papika and Cocona, yet they never gave her the proper closer to her story...\\nI really think Flip Flappers went under appreciated and definitely believe it's a hidden treasure of 2016.

This can please or dislike depending on the person, in my case,\\nit was something negative that made me lose a little interest in finishing the work.\\nAnother negative point, in my view, was how things were resolved through feelings, resembling shounen animes a lot without giving many explanations of why. I usually don't give it much importance, but this time it bothered me.\\nSomething that is worth highlighting as a positive point is animation and the characters, the animation is beautiful, fluid and very well done, the colors are vivid and strong, I didn't think I would see so much quality in such an anime. With regard to characters, there are no bad characters, most are not very well developed, but it is an anime of 13 episodes, you can't ask for the impossible, the main characters are cool, Papika is extremely charismatic and fun, it improves the mood of the series, Cocona is a good character, however, it is boring at sometimes.\\nOverall I liked it, but I don't love it.\\n[PT-BR]\\nUm mahou shoujo psicodélico bem viajado, acho que essa frase passa bem a ideia que eu tive ao ver os primeiros episódios de FliFla.\\nO anime é divertido em várias partes, mas teve muita coisa que pareceu arrastada pra mim, uma coisa que me incomodou um pouco foi não entender nada durante vários episódios, não parecia ter uma progressão significativa para mim, só após uns 8 a 9 episódios que pareceu que o anime me estava dando algumas respostas. Isso pode agradar ou desagradar dependendo da pessoa, no meu caso, foi algo negativo que me fez perder um pouco o interesse em terminar a obra.\\nOutro ponto negativo ao meu ver foi como as coisas eram resolvidas através de sentimentos, lembrando bastante os animes do gênero shounen sem dar muitas explicações do porquê. Eu costumo não dar muita importância pra isso, mas dessa vez me incomodou.\\nAlgo que vale destacar como ponto positivo é animação e as personagens, a animação é linda, fluida e muito bem feita, as cores são vividas e fortes, não pensei que iria ver tanta qualidade em um anime desse tipo. No que diz respeito a personagens, não tem nenhum personagem ruim, a maioria não são muito bem desenvolvidos, mas é um anime de 13 episódios, não da pra pedir o impossível, as personagens principais são legais, a Papika é extremamente carismática e divertida, ela melhora o clima da série, a Cocona é uma boa personagem, porém, é chata em alguns momentos.\\nNo geral eu gostei, mas não adorei.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'de706ae99e0e984262567ec3e1393163'}>,\n",

Wait before spamming the 'Not Helpful' Button.\\nI'm myself a fan of Shonen Anime, so I should happen to like One Piece, right? Right?!\\nNope, not really. But let's delve a bit deeper.\\nStory: 6/10\\nThe definitely most promising about One Piece is its absolutely unique setting.\\nThe sheer vastness of the world makes this anime outstanding. And even better, in that kind of setting nearly everything can happen. Adventures on the ship, tropical islands, deserts, or some snowy winter paradise.\\nHowever, despite this promising world, each and every damn arc is exactly the same, over and\\nover again!! Our crew gets to island XYZ. Some evil enemy appears and beats up everyone. I mean, look how scary this boss is (more to said boss in character by the way). After being beaten up however, the Nakama get a powerup, and defeat the boss. Repeat. And again. Aaand again.\\nArt: 6/10\\nI won't mention something about the unique Art-Style. Everyone has read up on that one already. Some might like the cartoonisch, and also childish, artworks. I don't BUT I wouldn't cut 4 points for such a reason. So what about those 4 points? Battleanimations. This single word is enough. One Piece has one of the lousiest animations in terms of battle of all time. Repeating scenes, classic cut scenes, everything. Just in the last fight I watched Zoro had a fight, where he parried an attack with his three swords. They change the camera angle, and suddenly Zoro holds only two of his three swords, with the last one being in his Saya. And the sad thing is, this isn't every once in the while, those mistakes are common occurences.\\nSound: 8/10\\nFirst of all, the OST/Backgroundmusic. Even though some OSTs were misplaced, the most of the OSTs are pretty good and fit the desired atmosphere.\\nSecond, the Voice acting: I won't hide the fact, that I like Zoros seiyu Nakai Kazuya. Ever since his first appearence in Gintama, he has been one of my favorites. The other voice actors did their share of work as well, I especially like Luffys, Namis and Choppers voices.\\nLast, but not least, the opening and ending section: I'll start with this. Later on, the openings get far too long with 2:30 each. Stick to the common 1:30 damnit! Well, whatever. Most of the openings and endings blend in really well with the overall tune of the show. I don't really like the openings and endings, but they fit, which is the most important point.\\nCharacter: 7/10\\nCan't really say, that I really like any of the characters (besides Zoro and Nami, but thats just personal oppinion) but they have their reasons of existence. Way worse than the main crew are the completely forgettable enemies. They have puny reasons for being evil, are completely incompetent, and worst of all, some of them even turn face (wrestlingterm: becoming one of the good guys) after being defeated.\\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\nWhat can I say? Some of the jokes were okay, but serious matters are painfully dump to watch, because the series is just completely unable to stay serious. Also, for a battleshonen, the battles are awfully bad. Well, at least I'm able to crack a wry smile. Every once in a while that is.\\nOverall: 6/10\\nMany think of One Piece as one of the Big Three Battle Shonen, together with Naruto and Bleach. Since I haven't seen Bleach yet, I won't compare those two, but there is no problem with comparing it to Naruto, right? Overall, Naruto wins by a large margin. Its battles are better, the soundtrack is better, the art is more detailed, the series can stay more serious, and whats most important to me: The whole skill system is more complex, but also way superior to One Pieces Devils Fruits etc. An example as ending? Okay: Why for example do Devils Fruits Users not loose their powers in rain? Due to Oda because its moving water. But at the same time they loose their powers in rivers. And strictly speaking: Oceans are moving waters as well. The only unmoving water I can think of are swamps.\\nIf you got questions or feedback, its highly appreciated.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b4b5e4e299a1eb09001afde6e4d31453'}>,\n",

It\\'s the filler that kills this series, really.\\nOne Piece appears pretty cartoony at first glance, maybe even stupid. Some of the characters look pretty cool despite that (such as Zoro and Trafalgar Law), and it\\'s a little refreshing to see a group of characters that aren\\'t just a bunch of sexy beasts. Characters like Usopp just look unappealing and ridiculous at first, but even a guy like him can seem really cool as his character develops. I\\'ve got no problems with the artstyle, and the series has many serious moments that are convincing enough to make you worry about the characters despite the cartoony look.\\nThe long opening themes are one thing, but the long recaps at the start of each episode are brutal and highly unnecessary. I think this problem starts around the Sky Island arc and continues on for the rest of the show.\\nAnyhow, I\\'m quitting at the Marineford war. That was 30 episodes of Luffy endlessly running towards the platform shouting \"ACE!\" while Ace would shout \"LUFFY!\" and \"K...kh...hh...!\", whatever that means. Half of it was just random pirates and marines firing their guns towards off the screen. I think the \"war\" atmosphere was really just boring and not suited to One Piece, especially since the all the fillers made it appear very slowpaced. The show lost its emotion and intensity. There are better things to come, but I can\\'t handle these worthless fillers anymore. One Piece is nearly 500 episodes long and it isn\\'t going to end anytime soon; they\\'re only halfway to One Piece and the real battle is just beginning. I\\'m sure there\\'ll be peaceful people living happily in the \"New World\" just like in the rest of the Grand Line, though, despite the fact that it\\'s supposed to be the most incredibly dangerous place in the world.\\n30 episodes of straight bullshit. Well, I\\'m sure the worthlessness and stalling amounted to at least 100 episodes. There are some truly incredible series that are only 24 episodes long; you\\'d do well to watch some of those instead of sitting through One Piece fillers.\\nI recommend reading the manga instead; no fillers and the art is more interesting. I think I\\'d give One Piece a 9/10 if it weren\\'t for the fillers. The last point would be saved for an ending, which this series will never have. Don\\'t watch the fillers for completion\\'s sake like I did; they really aren\\'t worth it.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '35b54e21bb566890c41a94551254a004'}>,\n",

In my opinion there are big milestones in the story. in order they are 1 Luffy gathering his entire crew. 2 (SPOILER ALERT) the death of his brother Ace. and finally 3 (SPOILER ALERT FROM MANGA) Luffy discovering one of his childhood friends Sabo is alive when believed dead.(END SPOILER) Yes these are good story points but these three segments are they only things related to him being a pirate besides the obvious like him beating strong people and his bounty rising yada yada. but what about him being the pirate king? Nope. About the meaning behind the initial D.? Nope. Oh wait what about the true history of the world written in the Poneglyph's that Nico Robin is looking for? Thats gotta be mentioned more then just a few times and be a serious story arc to help get closer to a proper ending? NOPE. Every time they  have major story points like the 3 I had just now and the others I'm probably forgetting what happens? They mention it a few times in the story make a big deal out of it then sweep it under the rug. the author is just milking the manga for profit at this point and i don't see anything in the story moving farther towards an ending. which is kind of the entire point of watching and or reading the damn thing. you wanna see the entire journey, beginning to END.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Oh, I can  tell I am getting my full of Battle Shounens for the day. And maybe for the week. So it\\'s time to put away revisiting Hitman Reborn for a while and review an anime I watched recently.\\nOne Piece...oh boy. This is a difficult one to review. So let me just say this outright. There are two ways to review something. One, you compare it with its peers and see how it stands. And the other you test it on it\\'s own merits. And you are probably going to say, \"Oh test it on it\\'s own merits that is good!\" Well, I tend\\nto do the former because that is the more Capitalistic of the two. Comparing it with it\\'s peers to see whether or not you should take your time and money elsewhere. And in the end, the former fits more with the dictionary definition of a consumer review.\\nAnd here\\'s the \"but\". But One Piece\\'s peers are all Battle Shounens, and One Piece is an Action Adventure (Shounen is implied here because  Action Adventure is usually aimed at a younger audience). Now, One Piece is an Action Adventure who is competing with other Battle Shounens...so you see my predicament. How can I compare something to other things outside of its genre? It just doesn\\'t work. And that is just not plain fair.\\nBut I must compare it to it\\'s peers because it is competing with Naruto, and Bleach, and even smaller ones like Medaka Box, and the aforementioned Hitman Reborn. I must also do this because I have not seen any Action Adventure animes, and I can\\'t compare it to stuff I haven\\'t seen! So, I must grade it as if it were a Battle Shounen.\\nStory:\\nUsually Battle Shounens have bad stories, but this one takes the cake. This is the vaguest plot I have ever seen. And that is because there is no plot. There is no structure. You can look at Naruto and say that there is an overall plot and story line that adds up when you add in all of the arcs. But One Piece doesn\\'t have that. The only plot that is in the show is when the characters are arrive at a new Island. Story: 1/10\\nCharacters:\\nNow before you stop reading this review and hit the \"Not Helpful\" button out of rage. Or God-forbid begin hate commenting on my profile or even sending me death threats because your favorite animu doesn\\'t have a plot; let me get onto the characters.\\nThe characters in One Piece are surprisingly well written...To an extent. They all have their own goals and their own struggles which make them all grow together as a team. As a character story this anime does fairly well. Most of the arcs are there for the sole purpose of characterizing one of the characters more.\\nAnd that is fine, but my question is as follows: Why have none of the characters have had lives outside of seven years old?\\nLet me explain, whenever a character has a flashback to their past they are always seven years old, or a similar age. What, have they been stuck in the hyperbolic time chamber for their entire lives? I mean seriously all of these characters are in their early to late twenties....\\nWhat? They are in their teens? No way, those ages are arbitrary, there is no way Sanji is nineteen. And Luffy is seventeen. No way, Sanji is obviously in his late twenties. Maybe 28 or 29. But not Nineteen. And Luffy looks like he is 21. Who are they trying to fool? Seriously. And after the timeskip, Sanji looks like he is in his early thirties. I mean, he even has his Italian porno stache going on.\\nBut I am digressing.\\nI am sure that these characters have had some other life changing conflicts outside of a very young age. I mean, the characters get more substance as they go on, it\\'s just I feel that they could have done their initial characterization differently. Characters: 7/10\\nSound:\\nI have had no problems with the sound, there are no tracks that particularly stood out to me or ones that I just hated. Sound 7/10\\nArt:\\nThe art is definitely at the beginning of the series a 4/10. But over the years One Piece has gotten with the times and upgraded it\\'s art to a 8/10. So I met it halfway and it is a 6/10.\\nLength:\\nThis is a special criteria that will be added into the overall score because I feel that this needs to be mentioned. This show is 600+ episodes long. I love my long running series, Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho come to mind. But those were all 200-300 episodes long. And there is definitely a point where a show gets too long. Yes, Naruto is reaching it\\'s 600th episode as well, if it has not already gotten there (I read the manga). But with Naruto you have the break between the original and Shippuden to break up the monotony.\\nSo, I think that One Piece being as long as it is is detrimental to the series. It makes it intimidating for the newcomers to the series, like me, to get into the show. It\\'s like, \"Well, where do I start?\" And beginning at the beginning is a long and hard road to get through, man. And you can\\'t begin somewhere after the beginning because the characters are consistent in their characterization. It\\'s not like Bleach where events happen and they are never mentioned again. One Piece is consistent to the point where the characters are constantly referring to past events. And after their characters get going, this becomes more frequent later on down the road. The time skip is an example.\\nSo I am going to rate length like this. 10 being the perfect length for the show, like Madoka Magica. And 1 being so long, or so short, that there is no time to tell the story or characterize the characters, think Angel Beats.\\nSo the Length gets a, 4/10.\\nFights:\\nAfter giving length it\\'s own special criteria in this review. I hesitate to add another special criteria. But since a lot of peopl- fanboys talk about the fights and compare it to Bleach; I feel they would not be justified if I don\\'t put this in here.\\nFor the fights I have not seen with getting as far as I did; I have looked up on YouTube and watched.\\nSo, the fights are short. Like, really short. Most of the fights are below 15 minutes with all of the bull edited out. Bull being talking and scene transitioning to see what all of the other characters are doing for a couple of episodes. And this just does not compare when the same thing is done to other shows like Dragonball Z where if all of the bull is edited, the fights go on for 2:40:37 straight. Don\\'t believe me?\\nCitation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB45FE6y_wg\\nSo these are the shortest fights, but length shouldn\\'t really matter, shouldn\\'t it? And it wouldn\\'t matter if the fights were sweet. And they are for the most part. I just wish that some fights were longer, like the fight between Luffy and the \"Door Door\" guy with the bull horns. I forget his name. But unfortunately the fight was wasted because the entire point of it was to show off Luffy\\'s new ability.\\nAnd that is not to mention that some of the fights completely break my willing suspension of disbelief. Like the fight between Zoro and Kaku. I can\\'t explain this with words. Just here:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WtrRogy_w\\nAnd the joke is that this is supposed to be taken seriously.\\nI saw a similar post in the comments. And that person was bombarded with One Piece sales figures to try and justify this. But I noticed that in doing so the One Piece fanboys dodged the question: How can anyone take this seriously? I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t. Fights: 3/10\\nEdit: Oops It appears I forgot the enjoyment criteria, forgive me. Please.\\nEnjoyment:\\nPersonally I don\\'t like Action Adventure shows. 2/10\\nOverall:\\nI guess I should end this with a miraculous conclusion that summs up everything and wraps it all up with a nice bow to boot. But I don\\'t have the energy. Overall 6/10. Edited with Enjoyment this makes the Overall score 5.8/10 rounded up is a 6/10...wow.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a162b949dd3887bcb3efb1ae35510e46'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"One Piece starts great. It has original setting for its time, it introduces the best hook in all shounen anime, important characters are nicely fleshed out, the main character cannot one punch every enemy, and the story doesn’t feel like the original creator has run out of ideas. But this was many years ago. It doesn't look like an anime worth watching in 2017.\\nSince One Piece was first published in 1997 as a manga, and was animated in 1999, it took decades to tell the story. Its creator Eiichiro Oda had just graduated from high school back in the 1990s. He kept writing the same\\nstory well into his middle ages. I grew old watching and reading One Piece. I sometimes wonder how many fans have died waiting for the story to end. Please, if you ever create a story do end it before your youngest readers get their menopause or other age-related changes. Fans aren’t immortals to indulge storytellers. Even Eiichiro Oda is taking more and more breaks to take care of his health. Otherwise he cannot continue the work.\\nOne Piece has one unique element that is hard to find in other long-airing anime. Its story is solid. It has actually two different storylines which Oda skillfully combines into a single plot. The first is the story of Straw Hat Pirates led by Luffy. The second is the history of the world of One Piece. As Straw Hat pirates continue their adventures they also discover the truth about their world.  The pirate king who died decades ago left a great treasure called One Piece which somehow can change the fate of the world. The world government fights against pirates who want to become the next pirate king by finding that incredible treasure. As you can see, the lives of individual characters are more or less related to the world’s history. It makes the story more realistic. More, these two parallel storylines in a single plot make the anime even more interesting when they meet. This double-storyline method makes it possible for the lives of different characters to be intertwined naturally.\\nIn One Piece supporting characters have lives of their own. Every character is also part of the world depicted. They don’t feel like talking heads in the void. Their lives are not isolated from each other.\\nBecause the history of the world is so vast, there’s always something going on behind the stage. Actions of important people belonging to the world of One Piece have crucial importance. They can change the fate of the world. Furthermore, the aftermath of crucial battles does have repercussions for others as well. By careful storytelling Eiichiro Oda succeeds in preventing the main character from becoming an undisputed god in power. Another feature of this method is that there is actually more organic tragedy in One Piece.\\nOverall, One Piece stands out for its original storytelling for shounen, but sadly, like all long-lasting stories, it got old. Its creator got old. Its fans got old. The world got old.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '27a979d8cc82ce9ed8e7d46cd177ab81'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Well where do i start ... there is so much to say.. for the super fans of One Piece, i\\'m going to punish this anime so this review may piss you off.\\nThis anime, like any other big shonen, made a crucial mistake that i\\'m going to explore, besides that, the rest is fine.\\nStory: 7/10. Well.. it is hard to explain this rate. Is the plot original and creative? Yes it is, but it does not sound nice ! It seems like they started with a decent plot, and then they just keep adding things to make it bigger. I mean, the plot doesn´t\\nneed to be \\'stupid\\'. I don´t mind if there is unicorns or mermaids or even islands in the sky but keep adding things will not make the plot better. But this is not the main reason for this rate ..\\nThe story takes to much time to be developed.. I mean we have arcs with 60 eps or even more.. i\\'ve seen animes with 24 with more content than these arcs with 60 or more eps ..  the pace is just to damn slow which makes the anime boring at some point.\\nPlus, we can have one hundred different islands, each one with something different, if the story is always the same, it won´t make us hooked. Because yes it\\'s always the same, we have a bad powerfull guy that took control of the island, and the weak good guys asked for Luffy\\'s help and that\\'s basically the entire anime is all about ... and ofc Luffy will always win. If the plot is always the same thing throughout 700 eps, there is no way for it to be good !\\nBesides all of those bad points, there is a good point.. the \"Akuma no mi\", those fruits that grants them powers are really nice. We have so many different powers and we always want to know which power the bad guy has. Because we never know, there are so many..\\nArt: 7/10. The anime starts with a crappy art, but then gets better with the time but never reached great levels ... the action sometimes has no detail. Some special movements or attacks we can´t even see them (especially when is about swordsman .. i mean they use their special movement, but we don´t see him actually using it, we just see the enemy being hit.. and that just sucks). The background is reasonable at least so as the character design.\\nSound: 8/10. Nice openings .. all of them portray the happy theme that One Piece talks about (friendship). The OSTs are reasonable enough to make the action and the drama good.\\nCharacter: 8/10. For me, the best point here. We have nice characters with a nice development and a nice past (actually when they were telling the past of some character, i nearly cried at some, because they were dramatic enough to make me care a lot.) BUT .. it\\'s like watching the same character every single time. All of them can be resumed to this sentence: \"I care about my friends so i\\'m going to protect them at any cost\" .. basically they look like this..\\nAbout the villians .. we have some nice villians actually .. they make us hate them, so when they get defeated we feel relieved xD but they are also the same shit. The motivations are always the SAME (take control of something, usually the island). So .. we don´t have that variety of characters that we see in other animes .. It\\'s basically the good guys vs the bad guys ..\\nEnjoyment: 7/10. This anime starts being good as hell, with nice fights and nice development but .. it was good because it was new for me. When i was in the 500th ep or so i was like \"yh yh let\\'s move on to the fights instead i don´t care about your story !!!\" .. and there is even some arcs that were painfull to watch ..\\nOverall : 6/10.. this anime is just too big .. it has nice characters, nice development and even a interesting plot .. but not for 700 eps .. if you are looking for some nice action anime, or even some nice shonen .. well you can watch this one, at least the first few arcs because those are good but i think it doesn´t worth, if you are like me, when you start something and then you have to end it, well don´t touch in this anime. Because you will get bored.. it\\'s just to damn long.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Okay, this is a LONG series, so it's kinda hard to review it as a whole because I feel completely differently at different points of the series. So I'll break it up into three sections\\nMy overall score is based on the last section though.\\nFirst Section [Episodes 1 - 223]\\nI'd call this a pretty fun anime almost out of the gate. It was really exciting seeing a very unique world, unique premise and interesting characters to wonder about right away. I really enjoyed that a lot of characters were introduced very early on as very powerful people, but we were totally left to wonder about\\nthem. This is very essential to getting people excited about what's to come.\\nAs far as the characters go, although they are all pretty one dimensional, they are all very likeable (except for Usopp, I can't stand him). Luffy is kinda hard to hate and there is someone to like for everyone in the series.\\nThe story definitely drags a bit. Lot's of filler and pointless sub-plots that drag on for several episodes, but still pretty enjoyable. The main plot continued to thicken and it definitely was alive enough to keep me watching.\\nSecond Section [Episodes 223 - 516]\\nI'd say this is definitely the best section in the anime. This is essentially the build up to the Whitebeard arc, but not before going to Water Seven and really spicing up the story with new, powerful characters and big character development between Luffy's crewmates.\\nWater Seven was good, but the chapter after that was a bit dull. Kinda just waiting for what eventually became the Whitebeard arc. Once that started, I was at the edge of my seat watching it all the way through.  It does go on and on and on, but you finally get to see some badass characters fight and Luffy really stepping up in power quite a bit.\\nVery fun watch, even though some episodes are worth skipping. I very much liked this anime up until this point.\\nThird Section [Episodes 516 - 677 (ongoing)]\\nHere is where I really started to fall off. At first it wasn't so bad, but I progressively realized that I wasn't looking forward to anything in this anime, and as soon as I caught up with the release cycle and was watching weekly since about episode 590, I realized that nothing was happening on an episode to episode basis and as it kept going, even less would happen in each episode.\\nThe last 20 episodes has been some of the worst. Every week I watch it for whatever reason, and every week I realize that I would have missed absolutely nothing if the whole episode was turned into a recap clip.\\nEpisodes don't really begin until about 4 minutes and 30 seconds in, and even then, it's essentially rehashing the last 5 minutes of the episode before that. They spend FAR too much screen time with reaction shots, sound effects and a bunch of shit that doesn't matter and very little with progressing the story line. I don't think there has been an episode in a while that would take more than 3-4 sentences to describe literally everything that happened.\\n[Overall / Story / World]\\nI do like the premise of the power system in One Piece. It's a pretty simple idea and pretty flexible. You obviously have to dismiss some stuff that simply don't make sense, but you fine with it... at least at the start of the story. Later on though, you quickly realize how unpolished the power system is. You have literally no balance at all. Bad guys will crazy OP powers can seemingly never exhaust their power, but Luffy is tired almost immediately after he starts a long fight. And as they add more concepts into the system, the more you think to yourself, why did we never see this before if everyone can fucking do it?\\nThey are all traveling the grand line, but seemingly every other pirate is waiting just ahead of Luffy waiting for him to catch up. Even with a 2 year gap, pirates haven't progressed at all down the grand line while it only took Luffy 1 year to travel the first half.\\nThe story just starts to break with time and characters are becoming progressively less interesting... However, it could be improve a lot if I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching each episode because nothing fucking happens. (and yes, I'm including even episode 677. Doesn't justify the previous 20 being about a bunch of nothing).\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6c755f580c9e9e3123937309b5d9fbfe'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Story:\\nSo let\\'s start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that\\'s really the beginning of One Piece\\'s creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a\\nstrange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It\\'s wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it\\'s carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It\\'s more like a child\\'s glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn\\'t explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It\\'s a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes.\\nLuffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it\\'s a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred plus episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of \"defeat - training - victory.\" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it\\'s a bit of a disappointment.\\nCharacters:\\nOf course, for the series to be any kind of success, the characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They\\'d have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can\\'t become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there\\'s roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn\\'t quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime\\'s central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece\\'s greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it\\'s still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what\\'s a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It\\'s a delight to see it happen every time.\\nArt:\\nVisually One Piece is one of the most unique anime out there; one could say that the look of One Piece is very abstract when compared to most other anime of present in the same genre or any genre. this is mainly due to Eiichiro Oda’s art style crafted in the manga which has a very unique and unusual look when compared to other manga. Some people have even put off watching this show purely based on the look of the show which is a darn shame because they are doing themselves a massive disservice. While One Piece isn’t as detailed as other shōnen anime like Fullmetal Alchemist, Naruto or Bleach, which have highly detailed characters in the facial, hair, and clothing areas, One Piece has is simple in composition but has a lot of artistic flair and creative things that you’d never find in other anime. The characters are very simple, not very detailed and look kind of wacky and funky when compared to other shows. However I feel that the look of One Piece‘s characters, creatures, settings and animation are very interesting and is one of the unique selling points of the show and if you give it time you will adjust and come to love it.\\nSound:\\nThe music for this show is totally incredible, its varied, catchy, epic and has a musical theme for every scenario. Each character has a certain theme that’ll play while they’re fighting or doing something sneaky and the songs work very well. Another great aspect with One Piece‘s soundtrack is that the music evolves along with the show with different themes for new locations, characters or fighting music for new situations and it really shows that the show is changing and it really immerses you in that world too. Eventually you’ll find yourself humming away with some songs, whether they are opening songs or particular tunes in the show’s soundtrack.\\nOverall Enjoyment:\\nI believe that One Piece is the definition of what shōnen-based anime is all about. Now One Piece is a shōnen by genre which normally means that one is dealing with an action/adventure-based cartoon. The codes and conventions found in this anime are similar to other shōnen anime like Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail. You have the main protagonist who is a man, accompanied by other main characters who are either friends, allies or enemies. The main cast of protagonists are normally in a group or crew of some kind travelling from place to place of varying look and feel, coming across different obstacles and overcoming them through meeting their problems head-on and fighting their way to victory. And obviously as the journeys continue the obstacles become harder to triumph over. But I believe the way that One Piece does it is just wonderful, subtle and done with a great deal of style that it stands out from any other anime.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e487d306ce9766e01a7a1704fc69cb41'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"''I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become The Pirate King''\\nThis is the quote, that sets the main plotline for the series. Along with the name of the title itself. Hearing this and glimpsing at the synopsis, I build up expectations of an amazing journey, coupled with an engaging story driven narrative and good sense of mystery. Unfortunately those expectations were not met with great content to satisfy them. My main motivations for starting this was my desire to understand why is this series so successful in Japan. And I'm afraid to say after I gave the show a shot, I wasn't able to get it,\\nor even see the appeal like I would for others shows that I didn't like.\\nLet's start with the Characters [3/10]. They might be one of my biggest gripe of the show. I could forgive the semi-episodic narrative of the show and the repetition found in the format of the arcs if the characters kept my interest and made me want to keep watching. It's not that I simply didn't like them, because Luffy the protagonist himself is pretty likeable, and I like Zoro and Robin. But characterization, progression and just the general writing of the characters fails to deliver. Luffy is two dimensional at best. Everything about him feels borrowed from Goku, and not much is exclusive to him. He doesn't have any significant character development for more than 100+ episodes. He has the same track mind, same point of view. Never changing or maturing. Not feeling any more sense of responsibility and not gasping a bigger sense of the world, emphasizing his naivety and immature personality. So he is a static character for a big portion of the show. While static doesn't mean a bad character by default, in the case of Luffy it makes him a bad character. It makes him super predictable in how he reacts to things, his interactions with others and his decisions in general. There is hardly any fleshing out of his character outside of simple dialogue and simple motives ''I want to be the pirate king'' '' I Will Protect my Nakama'' ''I love meat''. His characterization is very simple and while that could be considered likeable, it's yet not charming as Goku. Since it's just a copy. I just find him dull and non-simulating, the shouting and care free personality with the serious personality in fights doesn't make him interesting to me. There is just no particular depth in his characterization or the execution of his character. He is faced with a major life changing events later on in the series, but he is still the same character after it passes. When speaking of development, it's not meant to be a complete change of personality (180 personality change) but it means a significant change in characterization, while his fundamental character is still intact. A dynamic character most often than not is more interesting with more room to show more layers of the character.\\nThe other main characters more or less are the same as Luffy just slightly better. I found Nami's character to be good due to her conflict with pirates and her character development and back story in Arlong park. I thought that was a not so average aspect like most other things, and I even started liking her. But as soon as that arc finished she remains static with nothing to offer, making her interactions with the crew members predictable, annoying and hardly funny. I expected to see more to her than simple gags. They don't get development past their introductory arcs. Which makes them less believable and interesting, considering they are on a big journey that should alter their lives forever. Repeating of their dreams and motives every other time kinda makes them shallow, because they offer nothing else in conflicts, internal struggles or different dimensions or something subtle to make me wonder and try to think and understand something deeper or anything interesting really. They remain in a status quo for a very long time. The author just doesn't try and bring fourth interesting conflicts for them to develop alongside the story. It's like after he is done with their basic and initial characterization he just stops there. So they feel like very incomplete characters that have unharvested potential despite the length of the series.\\nI really dislike Sanji. He is the worst crew member. No. He is the worst character in the entire show. No. He is the worst character I've ever seen in any shounen anime. There is bad, and there is offensively bad. Sanji belongs to the latter. His characterization, I don't exactly get what the author wanted here. Did he really want him to be a celebration of sexism? it's supposed to be chivalry but it goes beyond that, and enters the realm of sexism with Sanji. When he refuses to fights female characters even if the lives of his crew members depends on it. He is not supposed to be a comic relief character, so this isn't an excuse to how his character is written and presented. I don't see him as a classy womanizer, I see him as an offensive character who's love for women shouldn't be more than a comedic side to him. It shouldn't be a big part of his characterization. It came to the point where his comedic nose bleed became an actual plot point, I shit you not. It's like everything about him aside form his initial dream (that is never brought up as an actual point of relevance after his arc) is about women. And that's why he is that much worse than the other characters in the show. There is nothing redeeming about him (even his style of fighting is bleh)\\nThe story [5/10]. I didn't see something particular impressive about it. There are certain problems that is apparent in almost every arc. They are formulaic for the most part. The crew goes from an island to an island helping the inhabitants of said islands, and go on about their way. It feels like every arc is episodic and discontinued, with little things barely connecting them together to an overarching story. I didn't like that since I like continuity and for a premise such as this, I was more in favor of non-episodic storytelling. As it feels like padding, since you get introduced to a lot of characters that are in the end not important or even relevant outside of their perspective arc for the story or the main characters. Once in a while one of those characters make a surprise appearance and the fans get excited, feels a bit like tricking them from my point of view, especially with the characters that are supposed to be dead but are never shown exactly their death.\\nThe type of stories in each of these arc is more or less fundamentally the same. An evil oppressor (Arlong, Crocodile) does his evil ways in the island and controls it for his own objectives. The heroes (strawhat crews) became friendly and bond with the villagers, so they are asked to help them. Luffy takes on the big bad and the others take care of the henchmen. This type of scenario gets boring pretty fast. Especially when it in itself, without the repetition is dreadful and the bare bones of a hero vs villain narrative. In Alabasta, it almost feels like a Disney story, with the person asking for help being a princess. Villains in the series in general are evilly cartoon-ish. Another issue is the plot armor, and how almost nobody dies. 700 episodes and the death of important characters can be counted in one hand. Nothing wrong with keeping it light, but if that's the the intention then the characters shouldn't be facing that many near death experience and surviving through cartoon logic. It will really test your suspension of disbelief. Luffy for whatever reason almost always has to take the big bad of any arc, which adds to the formulaic nature of the arcs. There no logic behind it aside from Luffy being the protagonist. This negates the potential for more interesting conflicts or the chance for other crew members to get a bigger spotlight. Zoro's spotlight in Thriller Part is a fine example of how Luffy not hogging the spotlight for once was incredibly refreshing and most importantly great on it's own.\\nThe pacing [2/10]. This in particular is one of the biggest issues in the series. That overwhelming amount of episodes isn't like that just because of the great mass of content alone, but the almost snail pacing contributes to that greatly. Toei is the animation studio in charge of this adaption. It became infamous for this type of pacing and production. Intro in the beginning of each episode, recaps, a lot of paused shots, and overall just the mind numbing feeling that nothing of interest is happening for several minutes of an episode. This is definitely the biggest hindrance of enjoyment in the show, at least for me. But it's not all Toei's fault. The original source material also has a slow progression of events. Along with Toei's treatment, this makes for an unsatisfying watching experience. Which is one of the main reasons if not the biggest reason why I dropped the series above all else. Take in mind, that this isn't to say slow pacing is inherently bad, it actually can enhance the experience of certain works. But One Piece is definitely not one of those works. A balance would have been ideal, even if I have preferences for fast pacing in action shows. It's currently according to a lot of people unbearable, so it only gets worse.\\nThe action component of the series is, in my opinion just awful [3/10]. I personally consider the fights in One Piece to be the worst I've seen in any action shounen I've watched. Be it in terms of creativity, strategy, abilities/powers, excitement or animation. The abilities/powers are silly, while that works with the general style of the show, its still lacks creativity, as they feel like they are created by a child. A rubber man. Someone that can make anything into a door. Feet that generate fire from the passion of the heart, etc. I will get to the animation in it's own paragraph. The fights are sometimes really dumb, and are mostly devoid of strategy. The best you can get in terms of strategy, is juvenile tricks by Ussopp, and the silly 'tactics' Luffy comes up with, that shouldn't work but they do because of Luck or/and the incompetence of the villains (the classic trite of you are beneath me so I didn't take you seriously and was careless) . Shouting and straight forward predictable fighting, is what you will get. The tension created by how is this character going to best this character is simply not there. When Zoro gets beaten up badly by someone made of steel, but suddenly has the resolve and wants to believe he can cut steel, and he just does with no good explanations, you will know that you shouldn't expected anything smart out of the fights. In fact some are offensively dumb, Bon clay vs Sanji comes to mind. There is also how the comedy is inserted in some fights or certain scenes. I realize that show has a lot of comedy, and it's a prominent genre, but that doesn't mean it should be inserted whatever. With disregard of the current tone and atmosphere of the scene, a particular scene in thriller park had that. It undermines the importance of the fights sometimes and the mood that is being set, and it in itself is rarely funny. The humor in general is not great. As it's very repetitive and most often dry. How many times until Nami, yelling at the crew and showing her greed becomes just plain unfunny. Though maybe if you really like any particular gag, you will still like seeing it again and again (Zoro's bad sense of direction for example). So it depends on the individual's sense of humor. It wasn't until Alabasta that I found an episode to have legitimately funny scenes, so I came across more misses than hits.\\nThe Art and Animation, and OST [5/10]. I will be frank, I didn't really take much notice to the soundtrack so I can't comment on it. The artstyle of the series is often described as ''ugly'' by those who refuse or avoid to watch it. And I can't say that I blame them. Is the art different compared to similar shows? Yes. Does that automatically makes it better or good? not necessarily. The art is influenced by western cartoons and Disney. And it's fair point for those that think it's works well with the series, and I agree to a certain extent. But that still doesn't mean me or others will like it, as it's still very unappealing. It also has an apparent effect on the emotional scenes in the show. The facial expressions are so exaggerated that it disengaged me from whatever emotional scene I was watching. With big rainy eyes, and noses full of snot. It completely lacks subtlety. Bigger doesn't always mean better. It comes off as the show trying hard to emphasize just how sad what you are watching is. It can be ineffective and worse, counterproductive, when instead of feeling sorry and emotionally involved you feel like laughing because of the ridiculous faces.\\nWhile I understand this is a long running anime therefore expecting fluid animation is unfair. It still should mean that at least once in a while you will be presented with good to great animation in important scenes and fights. Like with other long running battle anime. This unfortunately is not the case here. At times it feels like a slideshow. Barely any nice visual effects. Lot of pauses and staring. Still shots. No good Sakuga. And it only gets worse currently according to the fans.\\nThe Worldbuilding [5/10]. I left this at the last, because from my general understanding this is the most praised thing about the show. But why? from my point of view, there is nothing impressive about a city in the dessert or an island in the clouds/sky. Once again the creativity of the author seems child like. But maybe that's the appeal. The feeling of freedom, and childish imaginative without the shackles of reality. But it still doesn't necessarily make it great. It feels like it's praised because he created a vast world that is still expanding because why wouldn't he expand it, when the estimation for the number of chapters is beyond 1000. But then again, worldbuilding wasn't something that I cared for in general, in my favorite shows, or any work of fiction for that matter. I could appreciate well done aesthetics of a beautiful world, that you like to take a mental picture of. That's not the case here, so I can't really credit it.\\nUltimately, I truly and honestly wanted to like this. So the gigantic amount of episodes/chapters would become an advantage. I wanted to be immersed in a story and keep following it for years. But the series failed me, after giving it a fair enough chance. I stomached through the beginning since they said Arlong park where it will get good. I endured after that, when they said Skypiea is fun and worth it. I couldn't keep on hoping, when they said it's Water 7 this time, more than 200 episodes. I just gave up. There wasn't any pay off. Everything was standard average to below average, with few exceptions. Not special or distinctive to dislike or for this to become more than a disappointment. My enjoyment being hindered with the pacing, and lack of stimulating characters, I made the natural choice of dropping it. I just couldn't take another minute felt like I will just die from boredom.\\nTL:DR- If you are hesitant whether or not to make this big time commitment, you should keep in mind that it's generally agreed upon by fans and haters alike that it doesn't get better until Arlong park, which more than 30 episodes into the anime. I would recommend this, if you are looking for a happy go lucky battle shounen, that has a lot of focus on the adventure. I don't recommend this, if you are looking for a continuous narrative of a complex story about finding a treasure, with interesting unique characters. Nothing of value is lost, or something worth the commitment if you are avoiding this.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '92415a16e99477e6195211f6bf4eacf7'}>,\n",

And I don\\'t get it how people have so high opinion of this series.\\nStory:\\nIs quite boring honestly, if you like watch same joke 10 * in episode for 700+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until Summit War arc. In that arc there was interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he peaces and didn\\'t give a damn what other we\\'re thinking. That is only reason I gave this series even 6, would have been\\n4 or even 3 without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went to back to boring as there doesn\\'t seem to be any reason for any fighting again.\\nArt:\\nWell quality in art is like a roller coaster in this this series, some scenes it is good and some bad. But I like old feeling what art style gives and that\\'s why I rated it to 6. Could have been much higher if quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seems to be they\\'re not scared to use colors what I\\'m happy about.\\nSound:\\nTo be honest, nothing too fancy but quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall.\\nCharacter(s):\\nWell characters in this series are 90% of boring or fanservice. There is literally none character development in this series so I don\\'t get it how this series are even going on anymore.\\nLuffy:\\nPretty good character but I have watched over 500 episodes and still personality exactly same as beginning of first episode of whole series. As a fighter he is getting stronger but it don\\'t feel like it at all because still sidekicks gives him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly.\\nUsopp:\\n90% of boredom. He don\\'t have growth at all in whole series as person. As a fighter he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That\\'s everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don\\'t even get a reason of this character because of...\\nTony Tony Chopper:\\nChopper are pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if situation requires it. Chopper is as character is direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also Luffy to stop and cries help but if situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp don\\'t. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series.\\nNami:\\nThis character is 100% of fanservice and nothing else. She don\\'t have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just side character who drops after she\\'s arc end but no.\\nZoro:\\nThis is most interesting character in whole series, he is actually only one who has grown as person in whole crew, and that\\'s pretty sad considered how long this series has already run.\\nSanji:\\nAfter Usopp this is second most boring character in whole series. He has not developed as person nor as fighter at all. And his obsession to women joke is gone too long and got boring already. I actually hope he dies on nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all.\\nBrook:\\nCan be quite interesting character but feels like he\\'s going to be in same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy\\'s boat he went to bottom, he honestly don\\'t give anything new to series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper jokes so they don\\'t repeat same joke 3 jokes whole episode but 4.\\nNico Robin:\\nSometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive story forward.\\nFranky:\\nLast but not least, this character actually got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite lot. I hope they don\\'t ruin this because Franky got a lot potential as MC.\\nEnjoyment:\\nWell as I said in story, this series is quite boring and I have been \"watching\" this. Only \"watching\" not watching cause it\\'s hard to enjoy same jokes over 500 episodes. And usually I keep this rolling for background sound so when I\\'m doing other things. I actually had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations was crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment.\\nOverall:\\nWell this section is more like TL;DR for me\\n- Do you like watch same joke in every episode till you die? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it.\\n- Do you like series what are 90% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it.\\n- Do you like characters don\\'t grow at all (even after 500 episodes)? sure watch this. Otherwise stay d*mn far from it.\\n- If you want to watch this you can skip straight to Summit War arc cause there really isn\\'t any development in this series so you won\\'t miss anything.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '934f02bf0eab4c8b5247fa98650a191f'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"One Piece, is truly one of my favourite Anime and Manga. Although, in the beggining it took me some time to warm up to it.\\nStory\\nThe first part of the series begins by introducing each character as they join the main crew. It didn't really seem that interesting to me at first, but since a friend of mine was watching it with me I decided to continue it. After the beggining of the Arabasta Arc I began to love the series more and more after every Arc. The mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy, Politics are all given in a smooth and enjoyable pace. Also, the story\\ngives the viewers some important messages concerning friendship and how people should not give up on what they believe.\\nArt\\nThe art is really good for a long running series, especially after the High Definition enhancement. It might seem pretty different in the beginning after adapting from Oda Eiichiro-san's art from the manga. I'm not saying it's perfect but it truly is interesting.\\nSound\\nThe Openings and Endings used in the show can sometimes become addictive, you might find yourself in the middle of the road humming the new Opening theme (At least I do some times :P). The background music is also fitting for the series adding some new tracks in later episodes but I don't think they're anything special.\\nCharacters\\nThe one thing that makes One Piece one of the top series are the characters. Each and every one of them has a different personality both funny and serious and all with a tearjerking past. Furthermore, all of them get equal attention and spotlight.\\nEnjoyment\\nAs I said before, the more I continue the series the more I enjoy it. It's really continuing on at a good pace, exploring different genres (e.x. The Thriller Bark Arc)\\nOverall,\\nOne Piece has been entertaining from every aspect.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"The premise is simple enough.  The main character seeks to become the pirate king by finding a treasure called One Piece (you wonder where they come up with these English names ..) and starts by assembling a crew.  The pattern then becomes sailing from island to island, finding problematic villains and sending them packing, gathering crew members, and meeting people.\\nI had high expectations of One Piece.  As one of the most popular and best-selling manga stories in Japan at the time (and still is) and of the shounen genre that I am fond of, I expected nothing less.  So when\\nKaizoku-fansubs first started releasing good quality fansubs in 2003 (as compared to the HK rips, where calling the subtitles English is generous), I decided to give the series a shot.\\nI was disappointed.\\nAs I began watching One Piece, it wasn’t as though I didn’t like the series at all.  It was watchable.  Generally enjoyable.  It just failed to meet the expectations I had.  That was probably the problem.\\nI continued to watch the series on and off, with the early main characters (Luffy and Zoro) growing on me slowly, and Usopp knocking down my interest a bit.  I started warming up to the series during Sanji’s arc.  Finally, Nami’s arc sealed the deal.  For those familiar with her arc, which I still feel is the best of the crew’s back stories, I can say there were multiple, very memorable moments.  The feelings were real.  I cried for the first time while watching this series.  I cared very much for the characters, and for what happened to them.  I went from lukewarm to obsessed about One Piece.\\nIts been over 5 years since then, and I still consider One Piece to be one of my favorite stories, both the manga and anime adaptations.  I think One Piece achieves something very rare in its genre.  This isn’t something that I felt all along, but as I’ve examined why I continue to love One Piece, it’s a theory that I think helps to explain it.  Shounen series in general place a heavy emphasis on fighting.  It defines the genre.  Of course, there are reasons the characters fight, and those reasons can often result in long expositions and flashbacks (in the middle of fights, unfortunately).  One Piece is no different.  How One Piece is different is that the fighting is truly a means to an end, not because you know it should be, but because it really is (with many other series, the fighting is usually why we’re watching, whatever else the story might say).  Often, the aftermath and outcomes of the fights are far more rewarding and what one looks forward to, rather than the fights themselves.  A subtle difference, but it makes all the difference in setting One Piece apart from most shounen series.\\nOne Piece is at its most heartwarming in the aftermath of the battles, and in exploring its characters.  It is most enjoyable when it focuses on the antics of the characters as they explore the places they go and generally get themselves into situations.  The interactions between the crew members have spawned tons of hilarious exchanges and scenarios, many which are simply priceless.  One Piece’s main characters, the Straw Hat pirates, are molded after common cliches, yet, as with better stories, make those cliches their own and find a way to be quirkier.  The characters, one and all, can be unabashedly silly yet transition convincingly to deadly serious.  No transition is greater than with Luffy, the main character.  Although he appears goofy and simple, his attitude is better described as fun-loving and child-like, with an innate fascination of the world, new things, and exploration.  He isn’t dumb; rather he ignores typical adult concerns and conventions because they just don’t interest him.  Yet we understand what matters to him.  So when those things are threatened, his seriousness is wholly believable, even if it’s in direct contrast with his usual demeanor.  And when he is serious, he can only be described as incredibly cool ^_^\\nRemarkably, One Piece manages to balance a genuine lightheartedness through its humor and exuberance, with the gravity of the battles and hardships.  That lightheartedness is missing from most shounen series.  Other series have humor but there is joy in One Piece, which is apparently more difficult to create.  Not to say that this necessarily makes a good story, but it is unique and I’ve seldom encountered other shounen series that exude the same fun and silliness, even as it packs on fights, special powers, and bigger and badder enemies.\\nI should note that One Piece lacks some of what I consider to be vital elements of a good story, most notably character development and growth, and real tension (i.e., death is possible).  I’ll skip the last, since most series aren’t going to kill off their main characters, but I've not missed the other things, yet.  First and foremost, One Piece is a lot of fun.  It's a story that inspires imagination, and a desire to explore and see new things.  It consistently makes me smile.  And while real tension may be lacking, it doesn't lack for touching or heartbreaking storylines.  One Piece is an amazing ride.  Not for everyone, perhaps, but if themes of friendship, dreams, and exploration, wrapped in a fun package not afraid to be silly, with a healthy dash of fighting, appeals to you, what are you waiting for?\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6f20fa695a6fe1b0559fe1d4d6610b23'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Story\\nFor series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was\\nactually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday.\\nOf course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment.\\nGranted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series.\\nThis fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time?\\nThe answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate.\\nWith other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces.\\nWith One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world.\\nAnimation\\nAnimation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate.\\nThe fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem.\\nOverall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking.\\nMusic\\nMusic starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over.\\nBackground music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind).\\nCharacters\\nLove them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else.\\nThe question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box).\\nHowever, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of.\\nFurthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast.\\nMy one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters.\\nOverall\\nDo I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time whereOne Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production.\\nHowever, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c281ddbe9db77c4a89606960e46c1b0'}>,\n",

At first, it made people think that Coby was the main character because he was heavily focused on, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy just suddenly came out of it while shouting \"that was a nice nap!\", I was stunned because it was hilarious yet a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance.\\nAt first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different island had different uniqueness!\\nOda is very creative! It\\'s fun to see they are travelling around, discovering mysteries.\\nTalking about mysteries, One Piece has this \"Void Century\" mysteries which is that 800 years ago, there were a period of 100 years where there were simply no record and the government stopped people from finding the full history. They would go to the point of eliminating every single innocent citizen just because of knowing this history. The only for someone to know the Void Century, one must know how to read Poneglyph. Robin was the last person to be able to read the Poneglyph and she was being chased for 20 years ever since she was an eight year old girl.\\nOne Piece consisted many tearjerking moments.

He was a coward, but after he saw Luffy\\'s determination, Coby fought his own cowardice and tried to achieve his own dream.\\nThe second character development was Zoro. He was not afraid of dying when he faced off the world\\'s strongest swordsman. Zoro later acknowledged that he was a weakling thus he strove on becoming stronger.\\nThe third character development was Usopp. Despite he he himself knew that Kaya knew he was lying, he still lied to Kaya in order for her to relieve her boredom due to Kaya\\'s condition that she couldn\\'t live her life freely, Usopp started lying because of his late mother. He tried to cheer his mother by shouting \"pirates are coming\" because his dad, Yassop was a pirate.\\nThe fourth character development was Nami. It was revealed that her past was so sad. When she was ten, her step mother, Bellemere, was murdered right in front of her eyes. It was due to that Bellemere didn\\'t have any money to pay to the pirates who invaded their hometown. Bellemere, despite having the chance to just say she lived alone in the house, chose to admit that she had daughter because of her believe that she would never say she didn\\'t have a family. This showed that Bellemere rather die than to disowned her stepdaughters. The story didn\\'t end there, Nami, being a genius girl who was able to draw a perfect map despite being a ten year old girl was forced to work for the pirate that killed her mother figure. The pirate wanted her talent. They made a deal that if she can pay him 1 million Beli (1 million Yen = 8135 USD) they would leave the village. For eight years, Nami stored up to 700 K like Arlong\\'s slave. But Arlong betrayed her.\\nI can go on but these are some proofs to show that One Piece does have lots of character developments.\\nEnjoyment 10/10\\nWith a good and entertaining storyline, of course the enjoyment will be there.\\nOverall 10/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '943fd900fa81adc2d11db3c631b23c16'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'As Hayao Miyazaki said, \"characters who never change are not interesting.\"\\nOne Piece since the beginning of the timeskip has been a good example of that.\\nFor a while it was a flawed but phenomenal adventure that delighted partially by being unpredictable, while building dramatic momentum, the bonds of friendship, crafting a beautiful paradox of dark and goofy in its universe and making it credible enough that a five -year old minded spoiled brat would be capable of becoming the king of the high seas.\\nLuffy is kind of the Tom Cruise of anime characters.  He is small but he seems bigger because he is capable of\\nspecatular stunts, he has a trememnous s**t eating grin which was cute (for a while) and he is a little naive. And he has a great crew. They are the kind of characters you fall in love with, but falling in love is always a superficial experience. When you stand back you realize that they are all stereotypes;  the coward, the alcoholic, the womanizer, the hunk, the perverted grandpa. The only character that resembles a real human being is Robin, who is so silently compelling that she should have been the start of the series.\\nThe crew go their separate ways for two years after about 500 episodes. Luffy hides away on an Island to train with a sensei in the art of Haki,  much like Luke learns the force from yoda.  Unfortunately he gains all of the action figure benefits of the training but none of the wisdom.\\nRight from the moment Luffy reunites with his crew, not as a commanding captain, but like a little brother who is seeing his older brothers and sisters, the ship called ONE PIECE was sinking.\\nThe universe has gotten too big for Luffy to NOT grow up.  His immature tendencies are no longer entertaining. Rather than make him a character, Oda is content to leave him as a formula: he is tacky during funny scenes and aggressive and supposedly sincere during action scenes.  That sincerity feels phoney now, simply because it is not in the nature of the person that Luffy is.  It is as phoney as Donald Trump\\'s ridiculous promises to America, painting an illusion of a utopia.\\nA show about a candidate for a pirate king needs a strong character for a protagonist, not a sketch of a kid. Now this wouldn\\'t be a problem if the show were purely comedy, but no it also want to be a heavy drama at times too, and Oda\\'s ambitions have gone beyond his ability to write them well.  As a drama, The tonal shifts are so inconsistent. Sometimes it is played as farce, and sometimes it is played more sincerely.  More often than not though, the darker subplots involving themes like genocide are done very two dimensionally, and they tend to serve messages that are very glib and lead to backwards minded sequences. Robin (for example) is an adult from a dramatic  world who becomes a disney-derivative damsel in distress at one point, and her prince charming are kids from a comedic one.\\nThis is just one of many examples of Oda destroying the integrity of his characters by being too condescending of them.  He makes the mistake of thinking that in order to make a character sympathetic he has to make them seem childlike in innocence. such is the case with characters like Luffy\\'s brother Ace, who goes from a bad ass to a crybaby.  Indeed some of Oda\\'s philosophy is a complete insult to our intelligence, No subtly at all, and the emotional scenes are always breastfed to us.\\nThe Devil fruit concept was cute at first, but now it\\'s just silly, like an idea stolen from a video game. There are too many fruits, yielding too many powers and likewise, there are too many characters in the universe. Some of them, in fact most of them have become far more interesting than Luffy, and his pals at this point.  Since the timeskip, the Strawhat pirates have become increasingly less compelling and intimidating, and are now a bunch of pansies in silly costumes. We don\\'t really see an increase in their straight because the antagonists are always two steps ahead of them in strength, when they should be more like 1 step ahead.

The manga's print run recently outpaced Dragon Ball and the series, at more than 130 episodes, is still going strong. It's easy to see why; One Piece follows a very simple and very successful shonen action formula. It worked in the past for Rurouni Kenshin and Dragon Ball and it's working wonderfully for One Piece. The premise is pretty basic. Luffy D. Monkey, an irrepressible youth, ate the Devil's Fruit, which gave his body extra-strength elasticity. He's searching for the\\nOne Piece, a legendary treasure that will make him the King of all Pirates and finally allow him to prove himself to his childhood idol, a selfless pirate by the name of Shanks. Along the way, he collects an army of somewhat freakish rogues, including a tough swordfighter named Zoro who fights with a sword in his mouth, and Nami, a spunky thief. Together they have wacky adventures, beat up the bad guys, and collect treasure. It all sounds pretty harmless, right?\\nWell, right, it is. One Piece is completely harmless entertainment. The battles can be surprisingly brutal at times, but overall, this is pure shonen action entertainment. It is entirely unpretentious and knows exactly what it wants to be, and excels at that. That having been said, One Piece is not a particularly deep show, although the characters are well developed. The focus seems to be on the crazy villains and the endless string of fights the main characters go through. Luffy and his crew of misfits go from town to town, saving the repressed masses and eliminating evil pirates who stand between them and the One Piece. In some ways, it's very reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin and Luffy are both laid-back badasses with hearts of gold that surround themselves with surprisingly capable outcasts and defeat circus freak-style enemies in episode after episode. If you like that sort of thing, One Piece delivers. If you don't, One Piece is going to bore the faith out of you.\\nSo, for fans of formulaic action shows, One Piece is a well-animated bit of fluff that sports decent music and some well-done action scenes. Unfortunately, the bizarre character designs are sure to turn a lot of folks off. One Piece is not done in a traditional anime style. It's very unique and it's bound to rub some people the wrong way. Otherwise, if you like your anime rife with fight scenes that last several episodes, declaratory statements (“Ore wa Kaizokuo ni naru da!” or “I will become the Pirate King!” is Luffy's favorite thing to say...), screwball humor and a touch of originality, One Piece will not fail to please.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5b1a8665b59cb58e62d84f1a6eecf3e4'}>,\n",

Although I admit the artwork for a long stride of the series was only adequate, the epic storyline full of ambition, unique and enjoyable fight scenes, and a display of some of the most unique and down right amazing characters keeps this Anime at the top of the charts. The depth of the plot really only grows throughout the series, and the fact that you only get more interested as time goes on just goes to show how they\\'ve managed\\nto last 408 episodes thus far(with many more to go). Their are two other great aspects to this, and many of my other favorite Anime, that should be touched on. The power-scale of One Piece is by far one of the most balanced and in check I\\'ve ever seen. Each character displays his or her own powers or unique abilities/traits without the sense of repetition. The second \"great aspect\" to the series is the party-up fashion the story takes. I personally LOVE when an Anime starts with a main character and as the events unfold they establish connections with others and for one reason or another unite. One Piece IMO has encompassed this in their storyline better than any other Anime. However other examples include Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is the dubbed version. In Summation, for those of you that don\\'t mind subtitles One Piece is a top notch Anime that shows great fight scenes, in depth characters, and a plot that will keep you marking your calendars for the release date of the next episode.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6fc5e829af8e88d47e24c0d572c6436d'}>,\n",

I almost dropped the series on episode 2 because of it. Back then I strictly watched DUBBED series, but I figured it would be a waste not to try, and tried out SUBBED version of the series, and I must say that I was STUNNED by a drastic change of the quality and enjoyment. So I just kept going on and on with the series, catching up in a really short period of time. I heard that \"Funimation\" started doing the job all the way from the start, in uncut version.

I started watching One Piece four or five years ago, and still find myself moved by this amazing series.\\nI have seen and enjoyed many anime, from Gintama, to Death Note, to Legend of Galactic Heroes, to Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, a plethora of Gundams, and many others. One Piece has something that none of them have. In fact, One Piece has something that perhaps no other form of motion picture entertainment today has:  rock-solid, consistently good writing. Good writing is hard to find, but good writing that can stay\\nconsistent and true to a massive overarching storyline through 500+ episodes?\\nAt first glance, One Piece presents itself as superficial, formulaic, light-hearted fun, but then it  catches you off-guard with its depth of character, its surprising plot twists, its amazingly complicated and well-developed world, and its wisdom into the desires of the human heart. It lulls you into thinking you\\'ve figured it out, and then surprises you yet again. Plot threads left dangling for hundreds of episodes suddenly become significant again and seamlessly weave themselves back into the storyline, and you realize that you are viewing a grandly designed epic that is genuinely designed to span years.\\nI have seen far too many shows that start off great, and then reach a point where the author or writers start floundering around and basically start just making the plot up as they go along.\\n*Cough*Cough*Bleach*Cough*Naruto*Cough*LOST,DEAR GOD LOST*Cough.\\nNot so with One Piece. Every story arc fits into place in a larger tapestry of the main plotline, and does so in some amazingly imaginative ways.\\nIn terms of artwork, One Piece certainly can be strange, but overall it contains some of the most original and fantastic locations and character designs you will ever see, anywhere. In terms of animation, it does occasionally suffer from the fluctuating quality levels that most long-running series have.\\nThe pacing is good, in general, although there are a few times where it feels like certain events are dragged out a bit longer than necessary, although it never reaches Dragonball Z-like proportions. Many of the of the arcs feel like they slow down right before the big conclusion, but in a way this only heightens the emotion at the conclusion of each arc. And believe me, every arc has a powerful climax.\\nThe music is fantastic, although noticeably repeated. It\\'s difficult to have original music for 500 episodes, after all, and it\\'s only to be expected. Many of the tunes are very catchy, though, and I love how main characters are associated with particular themes in true Wagnerian fashion.\\nThe characters are the best part of the show, and I would rate this anime higher than 10 for character if possible. They are all fantastically written, both amusing and bad-ass, and tremendously consistent in personality. The Japanese voice acting for them is also utterly perfect, and while I admit some other anime dubs are decent, I highly recommend watching this one in the original language.\\nOne Piece never fails to move me emotionally, and always in a positive way, leaving me feeling better about life in general. Paraphrasing something Luffy said once, \"As long as you are alive, something good can happen to you.\" I started watching this show with my friends years ago, and I will treasure that time spent, both as a reminder of some good times I shared, and because One Piece is simply an amazing journey.\\n- Happy Sailing', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a7c32de9adb63c3c3b0f9264c8ae0420'}>,\n",

There are a lot of good, high class shows out there worth watching for the artistic value. But we can't forget the main purpose anime is designed for: entertainment. And when it comes to pure, non-thought-provoking entertainment, it's hard to beat a kid literally made out of rubber beating the crap out of a clown who can disassemble himself. (And that's just Season One! There's much crazier stuff than that.)\\nWhat I love about One Piece is that it never even tries to\\nbe serious. The characters are all zany, yet they remain engaging enough to hold the attention of someone like me who looks for something with a little more substance than your average kid's show. New main characters are gradually introduced throughout the series, and each one makes a meaningful contibution. Most of these characters are added when Luffy, the self-appointed captain of this crew, randomly decides he likes them and wants them to come along which adds to the silliness.\\nAnother aspect of this show that sets it apart from the rest of the shounen action crowd is the consistency of the characters abilities. The members of the Straw Hat Crew are never forced to undergo some random quantum leap in power level in order to defeat their enemies. This means that despite the fact that the show is currently almost 350 episodes in length, none of the characters have experienced the continuous exponential increase in power seen in other shows that would otherwise give them the abilities of Superman by this point.\\nDespite the length of the series, the material for each new episode is usually fresh, with a surprisingly small amount of filler and recap (though it does have some.) The action moves along fast enough that each new episode is simultaneously satisfying, yet leaves the viewer looking forward to the next one.\\nI'd say the main weakness of the show is the tendency to crank up the cheesiness factor just a little beyond my tolerance point on occasion. Other viewers could be affected by this to a greater or lesser extent than I am; it's really all a matter of personal preference. One other disclaimer: do not watch the 4kids dubbed version.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'One Piss is hands down one of the most childish and badly written Shounen I\\'ve come across. There is absolutely nothing interesting about One Piss. It fails at literally everthing it tries to attempt. These are the reasons why One Piss is trash.\\nSTORY: 0/10\\nOne Piss is about a trash character called \"Luffy\" that wants to become the pirate king. He gathers a crew of even more awful characters that also have dreams of their own. Almost all of these characters are one dimensional and do absolutely nothing to accomplish their goals. Nami wants to draw a map of the world, yet there isn\\'t a single\\nscene in the manga showing her draw anything. Usopp wants to be a brave warrior, yet after 800+ episodes he\\'s still a coward. Sanji wants to find All Blue, he does absolutely nothing to accomplish his dream. Luffy wants to become pirate king yet there are so many filler arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with this.\\nHere are some examples of arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story: Alabasta, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Drum Kingdom, etc. None of these arcs have anything to do with Luffy becoming the pirate king, yet they each are at least 40 chapters. Even the arcs that are actually relevant are awful. Dressrosa is one of the most poorly written Shounen arcs I\\'ve come across. 120 episodes of one arc, bad characters that get too much screen time, generic villain with a generic back story, terrible animation, slow pacing, etc. It cant get any worse than that. For some reason Oda isn\\'t capable of making a story arc that isn\\'t extremely long anymore. He says that he isn\\'t going to make long arcs after dressrosa, yet he makes even more bad arcs that are too long.\\nOne Piss arcs are essentially the same thing every single time. The plot is very formulaic. They go to an island and make friends, beat up the bad guys that are oppressing the country, new cremember (sometimes), feast, and then repeat. I mean it continues this bullshit over and over again for over 800 episodes. It already starts to get boring during the Skypiea arc, I\\'m surprised I could actually tolerate the rest of this trash.\\nOne Piss has some of the worst fights I\\'ve seen in Shounen. It\\'s actually hilarious how One Piss fans criticize other Shounen like Fairy Tail because of \"friendship powerups\". One Piece does the exact same thing. Every single fight is won by Luffy\\'s sheer willpower, not because he actually outsmarted his opponent. Every One Piss fight is the same exact thing: Luffy tanks evey hit, villain tanks every hit, but then somehow the villain loses because he isn\\'t as durable as Luffy. This is why One Piece fights are extremely boring. It always just ends in asspulls/plot armor. Luffy has won many fights that he shouldn\\'t have won, especially his battle against Katakuri. Katakuri injures himself because a random character interfered in their fight. If you cant see how much a contrived plot device that is, then I don\\'t know what to tell you.\\nOne thing One Piece fans praise about this series is how good the world building is. In my opinion, it doesn\\'t mean SHIT if One Piece has good world building. Why should I care about how detailed Oda made the world of One Piece when the crew is just stuck on one island for 100 chapters? The world building is irrelevant if we barely even get to see the rest of the world, besides the Island they spend 200 chapters on. For fucks sake they\\'ve only been on 5 for over 300 episodes.\\nCHARACTERS: 0/10\\nThere are rarely any interesting characters in One Piss For the most part, all of the main characters are poorly written. They just get their sad and generic backstories and then they never get character development again. A perfect example of this would be Nami. Sad backstory, then gets no development for the rest of the series. Usopp is another example. After 800 episodes, Usopp still is acting like a coward. 800 episodes and yet he still didn\\'t develop whatsoever.\\nI used to like Sanji until post time skip One Piss completely ruined him. He hasn\\'t had any shine in post timeskip. He loses every damn fight, and he wasn\\'t even in the most important arc of the timeskip. Then Oda makes an arc all for Sanji, which ended up being absolute trash. He just gets a generic sad backstory, doesn\\'t actually change as a character, and then he still gets no shine whatsoever. No one should ever compare this trash character to Zoro.\\nSpeaking about Zoro, he\\'s the only straw hat that actually developed as a character.\\nLuffy is hands down the worst Shounen protagonist of all time. Luffy has no character development. None whatsoever. He has no internal characterization at all. None. Any chance he had at character development was ruined because he just ends up going back to how he previously was. If an anime/manga is over 800 chapters/episodes long and the main character  doesn\\'t have the abiltiy to reflect on his actions, then that\\'s an absolute problem for the story. To be honest, there\\'s nothing interesting about Luffy. He\\'s just the basic Shounen protagonist that we always see in any Shounen.\\nThere are no good villains in One Piece. The only villain I enjoyed is Crocodile, yet he\\'s just a generic villain anyways. Besides him, every other villain is bad. There are no complex villains in One Piece. None whatsoever!\\nANIMATION/ART: 0/10\\nDo I even need to explain this? One Piece has the WORST animation I\\'ve ever seen in ANY anime. I\\'m pretty sure everyone can agree with this. I\\'ve never seen a Shounen with worse artstyle than One Piece. The characters look extremely ugly too, especially in the Whole Cake Island arc. I don\\'t know why Oda loves drawing ugly ass characters.\\nENJOYMENT: 1/10\\nHow can I possibly enjoy an anime that has bad characters and a bad plot? The truth is, I cant. It was at least decent until Oda completely destroyed his manga. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because of Zoro\\nOVERALL: 1/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6363c4bcccd0779d73b5c0bf30a9f438'}>,\n",

I actually got into One Piece after visiting a crack community on LiveJournal (capslock_op). I decided to check it out, but I was hesitant. Then, I ended up reading volumes 1-14 in under a month!

Please excuse the satire, yet fully stated, following One Piece is a life decision you can\\'t go back on. I\\'ve heard stories and things labeled as \\'larger-than-life\\' from time to time, which as a literal thing is hard to imagine, and I\\'ll tell you One Piece is larger than those things. If something truly is larger-than-life, as some frightful things are, it would lose recognizably, and have to appeal on upheaval or shock. One Piece is not larger than life. Hear\\nme say, with all appeal, that One Piece delivers as large as life can.\\nNow the life of a subject notwithstanding, there\\'s the honest directive. One Piece is indeed huge. The manga has been serialized since 1997 and the anime airing since 1999. I\\'m amazed every time I\\'m reminded of this. Stories are rarely if ever allowed a life so long. Sense dictates the market at large would become bored, yet it marches on. I\\'ve only come to the series in 2010 myself, which is truly stunning both how long it took to finish and how it still converts so far into its lifespan.\\nShōnen giants have meritable criticism. Drawn out plots, dragging episodes, truly few bursts of action, and many disposable characters. It would be a bold-faced lie to claim that One Piece is an exception. The popular obeys popular formula. Only the contrarian will find problem with that and, besides, unimaginable popularity is not well-liked by the hipster generation. I once held One Piece to disdain. 4kids produced a very awful dub I saw on saturday mornings as a kid. Its huge popularity seemed unjustified to my closed eyes. A fan of something so huge and bland would likely be boring, a sheep coddled by peers and fearful of anything outside their comfort zone. Simple minded fans always exist, so do not take my elitist prejudice to heart. It\\'s no quality I\\'m proud of.\\nWinter break listlessly rolled by. I was a freshman in college and belatedly frustrated with my social situation. That may or may not matter. Animation has never been a focal point in my life, but I will always very much enjoy a good story. It doesn\\'t matter where or how it comes to me - just if it reminds me of something, anything, important. There are infinite ways to look at life. I\\'ll tell you why I watch animation to tell you why I finished One Piece, because it is the same. I was looking for something to burn out with, insomniac halfway into winter, my strength fissured into coping instead creating. That is when I want things to move in front of me instead of me moving them myself.\\nWhat made me choose to start watching One Piece, and I mean definitively, I cannot say. I reasoned I deserved to give the show another chance - it was popular for a reason or something along those lines - but looking back there was nothing logical behind it. There isn\\'t much logic to go around at three in the morning. I watched twenty episodes straight, ending at noon the next day. The show\\'s whimsy and optimism - in a same line Luffy\\'s childishness and excitement - kept me rapt during a dank time. It may have been a false attachment at first, but from Zoro\\'s backstory forward I was in a combined state of excitement and satisfaction. Episodes turned like simple pages in a story, speeding forward until I reached an insane one hundred episode total. A long show spans a hundred episodes, but One Piece barely begins.\\nIn the middle of the Arabasta arc, some hundred episodes in, I actually had to justify and think about why I watched the show. Before then, watching continued effortlessly, just as only wanting to know what happens. Whether or not a story provokes such a feeling is only a trick of pacing and has nothing to do with quality. Eventually, everything becomes evaluated, and despite being bored with the Straw Hats wandering forever in the desert, I found it was not simple joy, excitement, or shameful pacing that held my attention, though they did help. It was the show\\'s surprising depth, not only in character development, but the attention to detail put into the entire world.\\nIf you make it to the Water 7/Enies Lobby continual arcs, know that you\\'ve reached the single part of the story that enables me to say One Piece matches up to any great and peerless execution of storytelling. There are many stories with that honor, however, that makes it no less of a feat. Without giving much away, there is driving contention in the crew caused by a practical problem and a more sinister one. A new character\\'s main reason for living intersects with one protagonist\\'s main reason to die. An old protagonist finally succumbs to his lasting doubts and shadows, acting most shocking and out of character for the genre - but thankfully not the show. The main villians are inexplicable and hard to believe at first, yet after, and somehow because of, initial appearances, they are more than enough to drive the story forward. The many conflicts, subplots, and rapid changes make this story arc the most complex and rewarding in the series and allow me to recommend One Piece to anyone without a shadow of a doubt.\\nI nearly quit in the second half of the Skypiea arc. It encompasses many of the bad points of the show - many bland characters outside the main cast (from Enel\\'s wacky helpers to the clueless Conis), overkill pacing (Satori\\'s ridiculous \"Trial of Balls\" lasted like four episodes), and few moments of excitement (Chopper had the only respectable fight and it was against a guy who would forget to open his mouth when speaking). However, snuck close to the end of the arc are three entirely wonderful episodes concerning a Montblanc Norland. They have nothing to do with the main plot - even occurring 400 years in the past from the main characters - and yet is of the greatest subplots One Piece has. The show had before convinced me of a world to breathe in, but somehow it had me interested in its history, even without a real pay off. Anything concerning a Gol D. Roger is even more exciting and equally removed from Luffy\\'s quest, all to an extent. There aren\\'t many stories where even its history remains interesting and convincing.\\nIf you haven\\'t seen the show, I realize my review isn\\'t being very accessible anymore. There is so much to cover when something is so long, so I know not to try to cover everything. One Piece truthfully remains very consistent throughout its entirety. Though many major plotlines have been boring or even poor from times, the show has never been dedicated to a major plot, or it would have ended by now. When others describe why they enjoy the show so much, many point to its character development, comedy, art style, and its densely woven plot. Especially liked is the very intense chekhov\\'s army. Characters and concepts introduced anywhere in the show appear and reappear when it\\'s appropriate (and many times even when it is not, such as Usopp befriending giants for no reason than knowing other giants), but appropriateness truly does not matter, for the directive is to make events connected, so that the characters live in a present represented by a real past.\\nThere is beauty in telling a story about a world, instead of only about characters, or only about a thing. To use a daft example, the Lord of the Rings has a fantastic reputation as a fantasy novel, maybe even recognized for the wrong reasons (thank hollywood). The Lord of the Rings is a post-modern epic and I mean that literally. I shall define an epic that lives in its folklore and obeys it completely, like a recognizable Greek epic The Odyssey. I want to believe the greatness of an epic is not totally reliant on its heroic characters, though they contribute greatly. A fantasy epic takes a picture of an impossible world and makes it a possibility. Those are the simplest terms, but it is not the act of creation that is important, it is the completeness. The world\\'s culture, laws, & customs are obeyed naturally in the telling and the characters, while important, impact overall a small part in history.\\nWhen I think of Lord of the Rings, I don\\'t think too much of its band of heroes, the struggle of good versus evil, or the strength of good nature. For me what stays is how detailed the world is and how far Tolkien went. It is a story about Frodo and the Ring, and yet it is a world of so much more. One Piece can be called post-postmodern, if you\\'re silly, because it is very much simple and bright instead of being grim and refined. Wouldbe epics try to be grim and defined. And wouldbe epics do not have a world I believe in, which is why they\\'re only caricatures of the worlds around us. One Piece, at a certain point, became a true fantasy epic. It is a story about Luffy and finding One Piece, and yet it is a world of so much more. Everything surrounding the characters oozes with careful thought. One Piece no longer feels only like Luffy\\'s story or just the story of the Straw Hat pirates but a recounting of history by the movers and makers themselves - a fictional history that feels so very real.\\nI remember my cousin over and we were eating pizza. It was shortly into winter break. My hand was my plate, pizza doesn\\'t need a plate, but he was holding a plate with pizza. Eating pizza, holding pizza, he looked liked he wanted to say something and didn\\'t know how. The need to share won over the insecurity of sharing and he asked me if I ever heard of a show called One Piece. Call it coincidence, still, I had just watched Luffy\\'s final fight with Crocodile and was able to express how much I liked the show. He was a bit farther, starting the Davy Back fights if I remember, and was very excited that the insecurity never existed. He was excited he had someone to share this world with, I\\'d guess. At first, when we talked about the show, we would focus on the main characters and talk about what fights we liked, what lines we liked, what backstories we most appreciated, and inevitably what characters were the best.\\nTwo years later, we have both finished the show, and end up talking about it when we see eachother, at least to discuss the most current episodes. Sometimes the discussion spills over when either mentions how much we like the show, or how such and such used to be better, or what arcs we loved and hated. Now when we talk about One Piece it could easily last hours - it is, after all, nearly 200 hours long - yet we do not focus on the main characters as we used to. A comparatively small part of our talks touches on the protagonists, partially because we both know them so well, mostly because we\\'re talking about the world at large. One piece has a world you can picture, a world you can really talk about, a world to be excited for. I very much like stories, as I say, but it\\'s hard to say flat things about a whole world. I very much like worlds too. It\\'s different, to say the least, and despite any insipid moment, I believe One Piece is a world worthy of any others and is an absolute joy to experience.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c81a2f9e96456f4c7b09ad4a5c627b69'}>,\n",

Sounds like an adventure eh? The surprising thing about One piece is that every small thing to the very detail is done to the finest level. I cant complain about any facet of this show and ill tell you why.\\nOne piece does everything surprisingly well, it possesses an entertaining story, with interesting characters and even mixes in intense drama which is huge since the\\nshow is a comedy first type show. One piece starts off with the main protagonist Luffy, one of the most ridiculous looking pirates ever, in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. This treasure was hidden somewhere in mysterious oceans known as the grand line by the greatest pirate in history Gold D. Rodger. Nearly every episode is hilarious as you watch this half-minded pirate do incredible things, meet incredible pirates and so on. For anyone who watches Action shonen animes like Naruto or Bleach, One piece actually does something better then those shows, it entertains fans nearly every episode(although a few fillers exist here and their, they are still quite entertaining) and it knows how to present a story with very fascinating characters.\\nI&rsquo;m calling all anime fans to check out this great series but I would be doing you a disservice by not informing you of the fallowing: DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH SUBS.

It drags too much. It takes up to 5 minutes and sometimes longer with one character building up his technique. To fill more time, the main characters fight side characters who have\\nno purpose in the story than just to get beaten up. But it takes up so much time as if something interesting is happening. You learn nothing new, there is no story progress, but those battles takes 10 minutes and more of the airtime. It is always used for comedic purposes and to show how strong the mc is. We know.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'One Piece is one of the three kings of Shounen. This is an undisputed fact. The anime started back in 2000 (the manga in 1997), and has been going strong for over 10 years now. Given that, I think it\\'s fair to say that if nothing more, something\\'s gotta be going right for it to last that long.\\nNow I, like everyone else who has reviewed the show, am giving it a 10, a rave review, and overall I\\'ve lopped off one of my fingers and replaced it with a thumb, solely to gain the ability of giving this show 3 thumbs up. But understand, I\\'ve\\nre-watched this series from the beginning 4 times now, and read through the manga twice. I know One Piece inside and out, and I\\'m not here to simply rave. I\\'m here to give it a fair review.\\nShounen Syndrome is an anime infection with symptoms ranging from over-exposed attack explanations to lengthy conversations where they aren\\'t necessary to horrendous filler arcs and even all the way to episode recaps that take up a good quarter of the time the episode is alloted.\\nOne Piece is not immune to this. No attack can simply go unnamed, or unexplained. Though they\\'ll only explain it once, and it\\'s usually not as horrible as it sounds. Though One Piece is in an interesting position in that they know it\\'s ridiculous. The joking nature of the characters often brings up the \"It\\'s not cool if it doesn\\'t have a cool name\" mentality. So you could let One Piece off the hook to some extent, as it almost satirizes the rest of shounen by participating.\\nOne Piece also did something I\\'m not a big fan of. Starting around episode 300, they started using opening themes that lasted a full 2 and a half minutes. Followed by 30 seconds of intro, and then 30 seconds - 3 minutes of recap. Sometimes you\\'ll have to start watching 6 minutes into the episode to actually get to new content. But this is both a blessing and a curse. For you see, One Piece filler tends to be pretty horrible. So, around episode 300, they upped the animation quality for widescreen TV. And to be able to put out this quality animation once a week, a shorter episode time makes the jobs of the animators easier, and production more cost effective. This meant a more quality product, in shorter spurts. The shorter spurts however, contribute to less filler. And for this reason alone, the reduced episode time and long recaps are in fact a blessing for One Piece fans. Though not many would know it.\\nSo what about the actual show? I\\'ll assume if you\\'re on this page, you already know a bit about One Piece. It\\'s a show following the adventures of Monkey D Luffy and his ragtag crew of pirates searching for the great treasure \"One Piece,\" with the ambition of becoming the Pirate King (the one who rules over the greatest seas of the world). The story is solid, and has only been better developed over time. Oda has done something wonderful, in that he had his story planned out long before it got there, and it seems he\\'s having even more fun with One Piece now than at the start of his career. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment factor One Piece provides.\\nThe art style is the biggest complaint I\\'ve heard about One Piece. A lot of people have told me they just flat out disliked the art style, and that was one of the biggest reasons they didn\\'t want to watch the show. Though I can\\'t understand this, I guess One Piece\\'s art style is more cartoony than most anime. But that art style reflects the values of the series. It IS cartoony, in spirit. That\\'s kind of the point. That being said, if that\\'s not your thing, I can respect that. The other thing to mention about the animation is that it\\'s been going since the year 2000. As such, earlier episodes definitely aren\\'t up to snuff in terms of animation quality, especially as it\\'s a shounen with a budget. But as the series and time progressed, the animation quality progressed as well and is now very well done.\\nBy far though, the characters in One Piece are what you enjoy the most. Luffy is your typical anime shounen, the kind of guy you can\\'t help but love. He\\'s simplistic and dim-witted, but his heart\\'s in the right place and that\\'s what sticks. Everyone is well written and typed, and the character development throughout the series is rather impressive. New synergies arise that both reflect Oda slipping into a more comfortable mindset whilst writing his character\\'s parts, and the characters themselves becoming more accustomed to each other.\\nOverall, One Piece has been going 10 years. And in those 10 years, the crew has grown up and developed with it\\'s audience. Even given it\\'s Shounen faults, it still does an absolutely wonderful job of story telling and entertaining. The main point I would bring up is never watch the 4kids dub. It\\'s not One Piece. If there was one example I could provide to convince you of this, they turned a french chef into a brooklyn accented disaster... smoking a lollipop.\\nThat is One Piece. My most timeless anime. It\\'s an experience I would recommend to any and all anime fans, though I know it may not be a good fit for many.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9bea2fabbff7b478cbab5562df441a1'}>,\n",

I loved every bit of it - the pirate theme, the art style, the characters, the story.\\nIt has been pretty much amazing until episode 381, or in other words - the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Up to this point, the plot lines of the arcs were really fantastic, the art style was good, the fights were engaging, I just couldn\\'t wait to see the next episode.\\nBut after that point, where they were entering Shabaody Archipelago, the show somehow lost its \"magic\" for me. I suddenly didn\\'t care as much about\\nwhat happens next and the excitement was diminishing. At the time I didn\\'t take notice of that, but around the time of writing this in 2019, I finally realized that I no longer care about One Piece anymore - I did not care about the characters, about the fights, about how the story goes on, I just kept tuning in every Sunday morning to watch the new episode, because it had become a part of my routine for over 7-8 years.\\nNow the art style has changed and at first I was on board with with, but later on I started noticing that the unique character of One Piece is gone with this new style. The colors of everything look somehow really bright and vibrant, and yet, at the same time - really washed out and dull, especially now in Whole Cake Island Arc. Where everything is so colorful and yet it looks dull and boring.\\nThe cannon fodder enemies that get knocked out by the dozens and once and don\\'t even have names used to look somehow more unique and quirky, now they look really generic and similar. The same observation can be made about the main characters and even the supporting characters, main villains and supporting villains. Enemies like Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, Enel, Crocodile, etc. looked unique and interesting, but now enemies like Charlotte Family who never made an appearance before look very uninspired, it\\'s like the author wanted to make some random, generic weird characters for the sake of making weird and quirky characters, but he failed at making them unique. Even the art style of the Straw Hats changed from being quirky and likable to overly-perfect, refined and with that - somehow boring and unlikable.\\nThe story arcs in the first part of the series (up to and including Thriller Bark) were interesting and unique, but now they feel boring, prolonged and utterly uninspired. Even Dressrosa, which people praise as a good arc, I found it to be very boring and a drag. Arcs like from when Luffy fought Alvida up to Loguetown have been a precious experience for me that I will never forget. When they crossed Reverse Mountain and entered the quirky otherworldly Grand Line, everything on the excitement scale got turned to 893593548935843. It has been the most epic part of the series (all the way up to episode 381).\\nCharacter development has been insignificant and at first that was okay, because the show remained happy-go-lucky without being boring, but by episode 870, the character development hasn\\'t been very significant and coupled with the other (and growing) negative aspects of the series, it is becoming very hard to watch.\\nOverall, I think that the author Eiichiro Oda\\'s inspiration for One Piece has diminished or has completely disappeared. He probably only draws the manga with the only goal to finish it and retire. His passion seems completely gone and what made the anime/manga/series interesting and exciting doesn\\'t exist anymore. At this point I\\'ve lost all interest to continue watch the series and will be dropping them, I\\'m considering moving to the manga at this point only to see how it ends.\\nIn my opinion the show stops being good after episode 381 and my personal advise would be to stop watching there and move to the manga.

       "  <Document: {'content': '\"A man\\'s dream will never die\"\\nWhen I started my venture into anime, there were three shows that I told myself that I was not going to watch: Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. This is because these three show have one thing in common: They\\'re still on the air. Watching a lot of anime is as bad as it sounds, but watching something and trying to catch up with is even worse. Plus, I mocked these three series for their appeal to the younger crowd. Then, suddenly I was told that One Piece, the childish-looking one out of them all, is actually the best out of\\nall of them. To be honest, I always thought One Piece was the butchered piece of crap that was presented to me by 4Kids when I was younger. Then I found out that Funimation picked it up and re-dubbed it when 4Kids went out of business. I watched the first episode of Funimation dub...I have now seen all 10 movies, 430 episodes, and watched most of the OVAs.\\nIn other words, One Piece is one of the greatest and most addicting animes of all time.\\nHow could a show that I once regarded as juvenile be masterful? Well, first off it\\'s not juvenile, in fact it\\'s quite brutal. At first, it\\'s starts off normal. We are introduced to our protagonist, the carefree and determined Monkey D. Luffy, the self-proclaimed future king of the pirates. He seeks to achieve this goal by forming the best pirate crew, sail the whole world, and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece. This is our first step into the brilliance of this show. Luffy, while not the brightest person and well-mannered person, is the character we as the audience want to look up to. While some can debate that his decisions always tend to cause destruction and violence, it\\'s that utter lack of not having fear that chills go down my spine. It\\'s the idea that we must go on our own adventures in life and pursue our dreams even if others say that they\\'re dead and unreachable.\\nHowever, we\\'ve all seen this story before right? There have been numerous stories about going the distance and following our dreams. What makes One Piece so different then? If I were to summarized One Piece in one line then it would be this: One Piece cuts the bull shit. Most stories about going the distance always have that one point where the characters give up or something happens that prevents and then something happens that suddenly makes them want to move forward. One Piece...there is no such thing. One Piece is all about becoming stronger. Stronger to stand up for the people you care for, stronger to advance on your journey, stronger to be ready for that final goal. This is One Piece\\'s true accomplishment.\\nThe show also has a strong sense of humor. There are so many times where I have chuckled and even laughed out loud from the comedy of this show. Even if it\\'s running gags such as Zoro\\'s lack of direction or Sanji\\'s weakness for beautiful women, there is always something fresh and some sort of new take on it.\\nThis leads me to my next point. One Piece not only emits happiness and laughter, but all other emotions as well. Emotions such as sadness, fear, hope, love, and sometimes even anger. We as the audience feel this because our main characters feel it as well. I can say that you will probably find something about yourself in the form of these characters. For example, like Luffy, I have always have had tried to fight for that one dream. Like Sanji, while his actions are exaggerated a bit, even I have to admit that I have always catered to woman\\'s needs more than men. Like Usopp, I have always have felt like the weakest of group, the one who is inferior compared to my stronger peers. Like Robin, I have always felt like the one who was misunderstood, the one who has been labeled by society as this type of person. One Piece shows that sometimes it\\'s okay to be different because even when the whole world is against you, there are people who will stand by your side and will fight to protect you.\\nThese character only then are brought to life by the people who play them. I have seen the first 205 episodes in English and it shows off what Funimation does best and makes up for what 4Kids did. After that, I switched from the English, as new dubbed episodes are coming out later this year, to the Japanese track where the voice acting is also top notch. It was interesting to know that some seiyuus here are actually well known. For example, Chopper\\'s seiyuu is Pikachu, Zoro\\'s seiyuu is Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and the one that I think that a lot of you are going shocked by is that Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamguchi, the voice of L and older Detective Conan. Right now I have been introduced to the character Boa Hancock and her seiyuu is Kotono Mitsuishi, the original voice Sailor Moon, the voice of Misato from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Excel Excel from what else than Excel Saga. The voice actors do amazing jobs in both languages giving some truly powerful performances. It should also be addressed that the score to One Piece is unforgettable. The music of One Piece not only matches great anime scores such as Cowboy Bebop\\'s or the original FMA anime, but even stacks up to John Williams and Danny Elfman film scores. Trust me when I say that after watching the show for a long time, background music will become so familiar to which you will start humming plus also indicating the type of situation that lies ahead.\\nThe animation of One Piece is also something of noteworthy. Unlike, traditional animes, the animation of One Piece is more of like of that of a combination of old animes, American cartoons, and in the hi-res episodes like that of conventional animes from today. In a way, it\\'s a something of it\\'s own style, probably the one thing that will make anime fans, who are used to animes looking like shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, not want to watch to this show. However, the cartoonish visuals of One Piece only makes it unique from everything else. While we do see some carbon copies of characters here and there, not often does a character look like another character and have the same personality. I tell you one thing, I have to admit while characters like Nami or Robin or any of the women in this show do have ridiculous anime proportions, it only makes me wonder are there woman in the world that possibly exist (oh it\\'s times like this that hate that I\\'m a geek).\\nHowever, this also allows me to say what you should know when watching it. Do not question anything that happens. I know that\\'s a weird thing to say considering that \"no duh it\\'s a cartoon it shouldn\\'t be taken seriously.\" However, I say this because the thing is the show keeps you so invested that you forget that a lot of wacky cartoonish things occur and some animes of this nature like to take themselves seriously when they shouldn\\'t. Luckily, the show is aware of itself and often makes meta jokes about the characters and the situations that occur.\\nI have seen a lot animes and the ones that I consider my personal favorites I wish have lasted longer than just 26 or 51 episodes. One Piece, on the other hand is still running to this day and to be honest when that day comes, it\\'s going to be sad seeing the final adventure of the Strawhats. I love One Piece, it moves away from the standard conventional ideas and gives them the middle finger. Damsel in Distress, screw that, we already have two ladies that that can kick ass. Living by government rules to which One Piece answers, \"there is no honor in the government, it\\'s full a people stubborn people who only do it for the sake of following orders.\" What about villains? Clearly all of them have the same personality right? \"who is the real villain here, is it the government hunting the pirates, is it the other pirates, or it could it possibly be Luffy and the rest of the Strawhat Crew who are the real villains here?\" One Piece on the surface may look like the average shounen but deep down there is something more than just skinny yet large chested women and cool action fights. I\\'ll just say this right now: One Piece is the first anime that made me cry. More than Wolf\\'s Rain, Clannad, and Grave of the Fireflies. One Piece will be and should be remembered among anime fans as something as a tale of hopes and dreams. If you have not seen One Piece, then there is no better time than to start watching now. How can I put this: If you wanted to choose out of the big three (four if you include now Fairy Tail) shounens, then One Piece is your answer. I love it and I swear you are going to love it as well.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '806f5d24813732950f6239aaa9844ad2'}>,\n",

We haven’t gotten introduced to the one piece or actually seen it which is stupid ngl and one piece just loves to skip fights like whitebeard\\nvs shanks, roger and Garp vs rocks pirates etc. they also haven’t even explained the will of D. Which is stupid since the show is like what? 940 epsiodes? But yeah there’s a lot of plot holes like the straw hats surviving enel attacks, luffy not dying to katakuri etc. I’m not gonna go too deep into the downsides since they are still great stuff about the story.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'This review will cover the first “half” of one piece (Ep 1-516) just so you can tell what period this is based on but I won’t give any spoilers so calm down.\\nLet me start by saying my first introduction to one piece was through the 4kids dub and I have to say I didn’t mind it. Of course a few years later when I watched the original subbed version it really shows the major flaws with the 4kids version luckily I didn’t get too far into it. I have seen some of the FUNimation episodes and for those of you who do prefer English dub\\nthat would be the way to go.\\nNow for the review…\\nStory: One piece’s story is one of the best constructed anime series around, you watch it back and you can pick up references to people or events over 400 episodes in the future… that’s a well thought out story line. You see Luffy grow from a young child to a capable captain of a crew, dreaming of being king of the pirates! It’s not only Luffy that has a goal, every crew member has their own dream and these are explored as well. Each member of the Straw Hat crew is a main character, while not being as focused as Luffy, you see everybody’s backstory making every person someone you become attached to. One of the best features of this series is that it can deliver on the paths it chooses either if it’s a more fantasy styled setting like Skypiea or a hectic battlefield at Marineford each setting works in the one piece universe and the emotional connection you end up getting towards each character makes the comedy/heartbreak/success/failure of each plot a gripping one.\\nArt: Honestly, when I first started watching it I didn’t enjoy the art style compared to other animes and a lot of the people I showed it to at that time had similar opinions but once you watch it for a bit it grows on you and you wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The way Oda has drawn the characters really has given him the opportunity to throw some very “unique” looking characters into the mix in the future episodes without them seeming out of place.\\nSound: The music and sound effects are perfect, if you watch the first OVA of One Piece you can hear the dominant sound of rubber being stretched every time Luffy makes an attack, while good for effect they made it look like it took a lot of effort in order to stretch. The anime series changed this making the sound not as harsh and as a result it makes the action more free-flowing. The music itself sets the mood exactly like it should and the times where a song you know becomes dominant in the series when something is about to go down really increases the effect the scene has one you. The voice actors also do a terrific job of conveying the right tone and volume for each scene.\\nConclusion: In the end I base my scores on how much enjoyment I felt while watching each series and in this series 10/10! And I don’t like giving out 10s but from the amount of wondrous time one piece has given me… it’s worth it and you should definitely watch it.\\nFirst review, any feedback would be good to help improve future reviews.\\nThanks for reading.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6e6ce72f667b3d0aeccffa7026e9e925'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': '*Spoiler Free Review*\\nOne Piece is an Anime about Pirates, Mainly one crew of Pirates called \"Straw Hats\". It is a action adventure anime, where the characters have special powers and are super strong.\\nThe Main storyline isn\\'t that amazing, It\\'s typical boy has a dream, boy goes out to obtain said dream, but what is amazing is the side storys that mixes into the main story, and there are tons, most of these are character background or goals, but it all fits in very nice, due to how big the One Piece world is, and how well the characters are devolped. The main reason I gave\\nStory a 7 is due to the real main story, it\\'s been done tons of times.\\nThe artwork and animation in this Anime gets alot of negitave response, but on the whole i\\'d say its average, its not rubbish by any standard, and sometimes has some very nice effects, But it\\'s not the best out there. Don\\'t be put off by the people who list the animation as why one piece sucks, because its the most stupidest thing ever, people still play old video games and watch old anime, do people complain about the graphics/ animation in them? No.\\nThe Sound is this Anime is epic, The Voice actors are very good at their jobs eppeically Zoro and Luffy. The Music is full of epic win! Most of all, all of the sound effects sound like the real thing, which is always a good thing, you know somethings up when a sword sounds like a wet fish hiting a rock.\\nThe Characters are very well devolped, even the majority of the lesser know characters have somewhat of a devolped background and continue to devolpe in the anime, something most animes don\\'t have. I like that One piece does this, as it adds to the well written universe the creators have made, and it also allows the One Piece world to expand.\\nTo finish things off, the amount of enjoyment i get out of this anime has only ever been rivaled by Death Note, comparing it to other animes of the same genre however, nothing has came close to topping how well everything in One piece goes, and sometimes I hope that the show will never end, because I find it that much of an enjoyment to watch.\\nSo go check it out, if it sounds intresting to you, if not, well i guess my review skills suck, and you should go read a diffrent one piece review :P', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '69180475a4772529e30eaab7f7a0c957'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'There’s probably a million ways to describe Mob Psycho 100. One simple word is just exciting. How can it not be? It’s by the same creator of one of the most talked about shows from 2015, One-Punch Man. As a reader of the source material, I can also firmly say that the show’s trailers and hype is legitimate. Not in the legitimate way that it’s the best anime of the century. It’s more of legitimate excellency that represents classic supernatural entertainment.\\nEven if you’re unfamiliar ONE’s work, you’ll easily recognize that Mob Psycho 100 isn’t just a show with traditional artwork. The visual follows the manga\\npretty closely while the action sequences are animated by a famed studio, Bones. Plus, we got director Yuzuru Tachikawa on board as part of the staff. Known for his work such as Death Parade, Terror in Tokyo, and Kill la Kill, it’s definitely something to get excited about. Fans of the franchise will be also be pleased to know that Kawai Kenji is the sound director, known for famous works such as the Ghost in the Shell franchise, Gundam 00, and the more recent Joker Game. Still, Mob Psycho 100 is beyond what just the staff has to offer.\\nIt’s not always so simple to understand the visual representation of Mob Psycho 100. Taking a closer look at the storytelling will give you a better idea as we are introduced to the main characters. At its core, we have main protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, otherwise known as Mob. He is a 14 year old kid attending a school with an average life. However, it’s immediately obvious that he is a special because of his ESP powers. Events in the story causes his powers to go unstable and Mob finds himself difficult to be “normal”. The premise is pretty simple on paper, right? An ordinary kid who tries to live a normal life with abnormal ability is the basic idea. However, the series delivers many scenarios where Mob uses his powers way more than he should. For a kid who wants a normal life, he gets into many abnormal situations which puts himself at risk. Still, this isn’t exactly the case as we’ll see how powerful Mob is. While he isn’t a Saitama 2.0, Mob’s abilities are not to be underestimated. In many battles he’s been in, Mob is able to overpower his opponents, sometimes without even realizing it. It’s interesting to also see what often triggers Mob to get involved in such unusual events. Social peer pressure and bullying are a few factors. Mob also seeks admiration and even wants to impress a girl he likes so this leads to him making mistakes at times. I mean, he is still human and humans make mistakes.\\nEven though he is the titular character, the show doesn’t neglect its others especially with characters such as Reigen, Ritsu (Mob’s younger brother), Teruki, and Dimple. Ritsu has really grown to me as a very interesting character. Unlike Mob, he is very clever and often uses trickery to get what he wants. Sometimes, he even treats life as if it’s a game where playing the right cards will win. What most impresses me about Ritsu is his own self-awareness and how despite being powerless in the beginning, he is able to rise up as a leader. It’s also shown that he has an inferiority complex compared to his brother (because he originally lacked special powers) and that causes himself to express doubt. This eventually also turns into guilt and there’s reasoning for redemption.\\nReigen is also an interesting character who is known as “Mob’s master”. He claims a lot of things and often speaks and lies with the truth. Despite being manipulative, he isn’t a bad guy and often looks out after Mob’ well-being. He also offers good advice to Mob including what really makes someone a “better person”.  One weakness that I do find about him though is his unwillingness to admit mistakes. Somewhere in between, there’s Teruki (“Teru”). I have to admit though, this guy has one of the most ridiculous hair styles I’ve ever seen from ONE’s work. Unlike Mob, he freely uses his esper powers like if they are God’s holy gift. What makes him interesting is how after meeting Mob, Teru undergoes a big change in his character. It’s like a bully that reinvents himself after getting put to his place for the first time in their life. Quite iconic if you ask me. Finally, Dimple strikes to me as the most mysterious character. In fact, he isn’t even human! He’s actually a spirit who even at one time had his own cult. What makes him interesting is despite having a God-like complex and ego, Dimple also wants others succeed in particular Mob. With such a colorful character cast in this series, expectations are met especially when it comes to creativity.\\nDespite the story looking complex, it really isn’t. The first few episodes introduces our main characters while most episodes for the first half just follows Mob’s life in his daily misadventures. The latter half focuses more on linear plot though as dangerous individuals are introduced that truly tests the strengths of our protagonists. This puts strains on Mob as he must overcome his personal demons. Because remember, Mob just wants to live a normal life and when he gets stressed, rage follows. When that rage explodes, we get Mob Psycho 100%, literally. And it’s not a very pretty sight.\\nAs a source reader, I am impressed at how they adapted the character relationships. Mob and Ritsu has one of the most complex relationship even as brothers. Teru’s evolution from a bully to a sidekick/ally to Mob is both amusing and also impressive to see as changes aren’t always easy for characters to accept. Reigen’s relationship with Mob is also based on respect and trust. Mob genuinely cares about Reigen and in one episode, his rage level almost goes out of control after seeing his master being put down. On the other hand, I am slightly disappointed that the season is only a 1-cour of 12 episodes. Some episodes are rushed as I was hoping they would adapt more into the story. For most parts, the series is still directed with good faith.\\nAh yes, the artwork and visuals. Even though I already talked about it before, it’s really hard to ignore Mob Psycho 100’s quality with its artistic style. It is very stylistic to the manga and unique in quality. When things get serious, the artwork really works with its hardcore cinematography. Violent scenes really do feel impactful while body movements never really suffers in the show as character designs are simple enough to avoid that. In addition, Mob’s character is portrayed as pretty plain normal just as he should be. Other characters such as Teru and Dimple stands out with some unique physical traits; seriously, I still can’t get over how ridiculous Teru’s hair is at times. In retrospect, Bones did a fantastic job with the production for the show. With talented animators such as Yoshimichi Kameda and Matsumoto Norio involved in this project, Mob Psycho 100 stands out extravagantly in the artistic field.\\nDon’t underestimate the soundtrack either. The OP and ED theme songs are also stylistic and as a whole. The OST is instrumental and often intense during many segments. Character voice expressions are also noticeable especially when Mob’s mentality reaches 100%. And because the show is so filled with personality, the speech pattern and dialogues of the more prominent characters are often very memorable.\\nThe amazing thing about Mob Psycho 100 is the excitement while feeling less of an anime but more like a comic action flick. As an adaptation, the show is stuffed with action, personality, and creativity. I can’t remember any episode where I was watching the clock and in fact often feel like episodes goes way too fast.\\n“What? That episode felt like 5 minutes?!”\\nIt’s because of how entertaining it is that is more than just pure popcorn entertainment. Sure, this might not be a series that’s suitable for everyone. However, Mob Psycho 100 stands on its own merits and is definitely not just a One-Punch Man-wannabee. Crafted by ONE, it’s a show that’s more than a supernatural character drama. It’s just a damn good piece of greatness.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3069351557c3a3768f92f0036d92b7dc'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Uninspiring, highly overrated, and cheap. Brilliance and creativity are the last things to come to mind while watching Mob Psycho 100.\\nThe story is a complete joke. It is a major step-down compared to One\\'s other work, One Punch Man. The entire story plays out like a tale a 5th grader would write and present. Of the many terrible presentations Mob Psycho 100 has to offer, One of the most bothersome reoccurring things is that the show lacks of creativity. The main character in particular, shares the same characteristic traits and personality of Saitama from One Punch Man. The plot and story always feature an overpowered\\nmain character that is socially awkward trying to save the day with his inexplicably obtained powers. The main characters in his works usually lack any motivation unless they\\'re triggered more than the typical girl on Tumblr. Rinse & repeat for every this process for just about every episode and that my dear readers is the show.  If this continues as a re-occurring theme for his stories, One needs to do a better job with creating and introducing a story, plot, and characters that doesn’t appear too similar to his other works.\\nFun fact: Did you know that you can pretty much get an idea of what the plot is about for the rest of the series based upon the opening title sequence alone?\\nOne was either sitting on the toilet or taking a shower when he thought about what was going to happen next for this series. The director could have easily changed specific things to make it more intriguing however; there were no signs of that happening. Now perhaps one of the interesting things involving the story was that certain episode\\'s do like to focus on more serious matters. It wasn\\'t all nonsensical fighting. To contradict what I said about the toilet thing earlier, there were a few moments in the story were the characters did try to improve their powers while trying to understand the most complicated things about their psychic powers and abilities.\\nThere were multiple scenes featured within the story where tense emotional dialogue would temporarily take over action scenes. It made the show a little more “dramatic” however; I don’t believe that most of the parts where these “dramatic moments” had taken place were proper. This was evident during many of the fights. The pacing of the story was pretty straight-forward. Often times there didn\\'t seem to be a reason to go back and explain certain details within the story. Depending on how you perceived the show, I didn’t thing that the story was as awful as others make it out to be.\\nIn conclusion, the story could’ve have definitely used some touching up! Plot developments lack excitement; it’s constantly riddled with predictable moments, and lacks an interesting narrative.\\nAnimation, character designs, quality and background settings. The following are the shows weak points in the art department. There were some pretty decent fighting and action sequences. The bad thing is that they are plagued with awful choices made in quality, setting, and special effects. I look back at earlier episodes like 4 & 5 prospectively, and believe that within the entire series 4 & 5 had the best fight scenes; this is me being nice by the way. Although the background setting featured in those particular episode were plain and dull. The school yard setting reminded me of old anime from the 70\\'s, 80\\'s, and 90\\'s. In those days, background settings were not that important unless it had meaning.Of course it being 2016 at the time of this review, it is highly unacceptable by today’s standards..\\nThe animators often times put a lot effort into the details of a fight. Characters muscles, facial reactions, and body reactions along with the well fitted dialogue, worked out pretty damn well. Sometimes, it made for more believable and intense fights. Not all fights were good though, I use episode 8 such as, during the time Mob is getting Rekt, the animation, facial expressions body movements looked a complete mess. While it may be fixed in the Blu-ray it still doesn\\'t change the fact that it was terrible at first.\\nMoving on, special effects like the rain and the auroras surrounding characters while they are using their powers. It looked as if the animators just went into after effects or even Sony Vegas, created them, and put them into the final product. It seems safe to say that this series was on a budget.\\nThis could be good or bad because if you\\'re reading the manga then you can tell that the animators decided to stick with the original designs created by One. Bad thing is that, if you\\'re like me, and care about seeing animators put a lot effort towards making an original work look better with upgraded character designs, special effects, and lots of great details in various scenes, you would be disappointed. Now I\\'ve seen many, many titles where the manga or LN designs look, and are much more beautiful than the anime however, now is not the time to discuss it.\\nIn short, Mob psycho is a visual disaster!  Characters designs in the manga, as mentioned earlier lack any kind of beauty or aesthetics. But, I\\'m focused on the anime now. Getting back on the subject, anime character designs are a pain to look at. Every other character appears to look exactly alike in facial features. This ranges from the head shapes, eyes, along with facial structures and hair. The appearances of characters, background settings, clothing, and background objects seen within the series are poor in quality and design.\\nThe sound was pretty decent. There were less than a handful of tracks and sound effects that made the show stand out. The music composed for certain scenes that express sadness, depression enhances the mood and atmosphere. Songs created for the fight sequences were lacking an edge to make the fight more engaging. The voice actors were “okay.” I didn\\'t think the actors had the right attitude for the series.\\nSome seiyuu’s are dedicated to making their characters sound more realistic by remember something that made them angry in the past and expressing the anger they felt from that experience to make a more believable attitude or sound for their characters vocals. For the most part, I did not feel that the voice actors were putting forth all their potential.\\nIn ONE\\'s future work I hope that he introduces more original characters. The characters are too one-dimensional. I wanted to drop this show on episode 2 because of this. The main character Shigeo is a blatant, lazily copy & pasted Saitama. I had trouble trying to like Shigeo because he doesn\\'t have the same appeal that Saitama does, despite being a rip off. Shigeo\\'s most unappealing trait is his socially awkward and clueless demeanor.\\nSometimes it\\'s cute when girls in anime are shy and awkward, however guys, not so much. Side characters are a joke. You know, as I’m writing this, I don’t even think that’s a good word to describe them because they were not in any way funny. While some give a little entertainment others are so annoying. I found this true mostly with the antagonists. The so-called \"supportive\" characters are more like comic relief than anything else.ONE appears to lack the ability to create characters that have a more “unique” and “rich” personality. His bad habit of copying and pasting the same characters from his different work is getting stale.\\nEnjoyment during the span of this series ranged from “awful” and “okay.” I usually drop titles after four episodes however the fourth was a deal breaker. I gradually continued to hope that maybe a new development in the story and characters would come along to change my negative feelings for Mob Psycho. This simply was not the case. Some may argue that “most people fail to see the shows appeal” or that “You shouldn’t judge a show based upon appearances.” I argue back that when it comes down to Mob Psycho, the show tosses away fluent story-telling, creative writing, lasting appeal, memorable characters, good character designs, creative background settings, quality animation and a soundtrack with songs you can keep on repeat.\\nThe real question is why and how? How could a show that has such awful traits be so highly praised? The answer is simple. Simplicity is what the show builds its foundation upon. The entire show is simple enough for anyone new or old to anime understand easily and most importantly enjoy. Its’ welcoming, the show doesn’t need good character designs or a good introduction. Having high quality animation? Forget that! Everything is kept simple, and that’s’ actually a good thing. I think of it as an old Nintendo console. You play Super Mario bros 3. You’re having a good time, sure the graphics aren’t the best, but the important thing is that you’re having a good time. You’re having fun seeing the simplicity and joy of Mario flying around in a tanooki suit crushing goomba’s and turtles.\\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 really needed work in creativity. Mob Psycho would’ve continued to do well\\nas just a manga title. As for whether I recommend this or not, I would actually say yes. Mob is a pretty good despite the fact that it lacks appeal, creative story-telling, and quality. Referring Mob, or even considering Mob Psycho 100 to be less than or equal to One-Punch Man is an insult.\\nFinal thoughts,\\nI felt that Mob Psycho 100 deserved a solid 4/10 for trying… if you even want to call it that.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '909220ee4a0b433ee33b7ef15aba71ea'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Have you ever watched an anime that had 12 episodes that had very interesting visuals, great characters (and development) and story that was charming in its own nature? No? Well Mob Psycho 100 is right here for you to watch!\\nStory - 8/10\\nTo be entirely honest, I didn\\'t think much with this series. I was going to skip over it and not even bat an eye at it--why? I heard it was by ONE and even though I enjoyed One Punch Man, it wasn\\'t something I\\'d rewatch and go after again. I tend to steer away from \"stereotypical\" shounen series nowadays. I thought this\\nseries was going to be the same formula. I was wrong. Yes, the anime starts off slow--yes it appears to be recycled garbage at first. But it really evolves into something very charming.\\nThe premise of this series is pretty simplistic. Mob is the main character and he\\'s a middle school boy who\\'s an outcast from most of society, including social circles. What separates him from the norm is his psychic abilities. It\\'s quite a quirky show with a lot of comedy elements. Each episode consists of Mob going after spirits and  performing an exorcism using his psychic abilities. Along the way you meet different characters that add to the comedy aspect of this anime.  With this said, story-wise. It\\'s more of a character driven show, but honestly, I like the simple story and how it goes deeper and deeper into the world building. Conflicts arise later in the series and the way it\\'s handled between the characters is nothing short of amazing. I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m really sick of melodramatic sequences in stories where characters act really stupid (i.e. romcoms) and it ruins the quality of storyline.\\nMob Psycho 100 doesn\\'t do that--it propels a simple story with endearing characters. I\\'m honestly so surprised how much world building we got in 12 episodes without it feeling rushed (I\\'m an anime only so I do not know how well paced it was compared to the source material).\\nArt - 10/10\\nBones has done it again with another incredible job with animation! The art is probably what makes this anime stick out so much--and why people probably turned a blind eye to this series. Which is such a shame given the beautifully fluid animation; especially in action scenes! The style may come off more cartoony than the traditional \"moe\" anime style we are all used to, but I promise you that it\\'s not a reason to overlook this anime. I personally think the style is unique and really sets a tone for the series. It\\'s simple in nature much like the story.\\nSound - 9/10\\nThe OP \"Mob Choir 99\" is such a catchy tune and you start counting with the song every week! The visuals that go with it is also very catching! You notice something new every time you look it. The ED song is very simple and mellow--this captures the easy going nature of the series (until the battles scenes though lol).  The OSTS are also very interesting to hear.\\nCharacter - 10/10\\nI\\'ve seen comedy series get 25 episodes and do absolutely nothing with the characters and shove repetitive rubbish in my face episode after episode. Whether you like the comedy or not is entirely subjective, but regardless, in 12 episodes I never once felt that rubbish shoving in my face. The characters manage to get more development in such a short amount of time compared to anime with 24 episodes.\\nOur main character, Mob, starts off fairly easy to read. He\\'s introverted in nature and isn\\'t good with social interactions. The only thing he seems to be good at is his psychic abilities--he has deep admiration for his little brother who seems to be the top at everything except what Mob is good at. Later in the story, we see how Mob expresses his emotions and feelings. We see how complicated and powerful he truly is. But what separates him from most main shounen characters is his modesty--he doesn\\'t want these powers and he never once in the 12 episodes ever desires to be stronger. He\\'s never egotistic about it. He never shows it off. He\\'s almost always kind to anyone who returns kindness to him. He tries his best and he\\'s deeply supported by those around him. He\\'s a misfit in theory, but he\\'s managed to have so many people care about him and despite his struggle to express feelings, he\\'s close to them as well. He never wants to hurt anyone unless it\\'s a spirit. He\\'ll do anything to protect his brother and friends even if it meant throwing away personal values. And even when he\\'s been knocked down and defeated, he gets back up and though he may lose his way, he still tries. Maybe not with strength, maybe just maybe, in the end he will win without really winning. Maybe he\\'ll succeed with only restoring those personal values and the faith others have given him. Mob, the main character of Mob Psycho 100.\\nAnything else I say about the characters would be considered spoilers, and I wouldn\\'t want to ruin it! But for the sake of summary, Ritsu (Mob\\'s brother) has great development and beautiful characters bonding between brothers :\\') Reigen (Mob\\'s Master) comes off as an asshole in the beginning and you come to think that he only uses Mob as a tool for his own personal gain. Later on however, you come to realize there\\'s way more to him than at first though. He will also have his shinning moment! Ekubo (Mob\\'s spirit friend) starts off evil but then develops a bond not just between Mob, but the other main characters and even some of the supporting characters. He went from bad to not so bad haha.\\nAny other characters that have some sort of role are likable and charming to say the least. It\\'s just all well balanced with a full set of cast without making it feel overwhelming! I\\'m just so impressed with how Bones handled this anime--so very impressed.\\nEnjoyment/overall - 10/10\\nThrough the comedy, stunning action, great characters, and unraveling plot, this anime didn\\'t fail to assume me! I\\'m so excited to see a season 2 ASAP! I highly recommend this anime :)', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '6e39f93260c102482995c89819438744'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Funny, whimsical, charming, and oddly enough, thoughtful.\\nMob Psycho 100 is another comedic/action endeavor brought to us by author ONE, the mind behind 2015\\'s breakout hit, One Punch Man, and like that success story, this also carries with it his signature flare for cool action set-pieces, theatrical displays of goofball antics, an art presence that\\'s immediately eye-catching, all while being peppered with an obtuse sense of humor that\\'s interwoven to form the finished product. And while it started out in a manner that felt like a subsidiary of its much more recognizable older brother, as it ventured on, it has proven to be more than\\ncapable in earning its own identity, deserving of the same level of respect as its predecessor. Where One Punch Man was all about being bullheadedly direct with everything it hits you with, Mob Psycho 100 instead chooses to blare the same kind of energy upfront, before coming in with a sneaky left hook; one that not only rattles off a few bells to the unexpected viewer but also lands the first blow of the show\\'s claim to autonomy from unnecessary comparisons to determine its own self-worth.\\nAnd with that being said, let\\'s get the obligatory comparisons out of the way first, if only for the sake of those viewers who simply came for just that.\\n•Both Mob and Saitama are characters with regressed emotions, but where Saitama\\'s emotionless state comes from sheer boredom from a life with no true obstacles, Mob\\'s state derives from a completely different reason. He\\'s socially inept and insecure about his inability to make meaningful connections, while at the same time, mindful of his immense power, choosing to suppress them, and in the course of doing so, suppress his feelings as well. But when he could no longer keep those emotions in check, the show\\'s namesake becomes clear as day, but we\\'ll address that later, for now, hold on to that thought.\\n•They contain fights that are equal parts wacky and inventive. Where OPM chose a more polished look to exemplify everything, MP100 decided to go the opposite route, staying faithful to the source material, while maintaining the level of quality expected from a work of its stature.\\n•Mob looks like Saitama with a wig.\\nAlright, with the comparisons out of the way, on with the review!\\nThe first thing that would immediately jump out at you is the art itself, which could be described as a fever dream filtered through a barrage of psychedelia, along the lines of a visual interpretation of an acid trip. With neon reds and blues swirling around disproportionate character designs, and animators that look like they\\'re trying everything within their power just to color within the lines, this anime could get quite intoxicating at times. An accomplishment in wacky cerebral distortion that hasn\\'t been seen since 2008\\'s Kaiba. And it\\'s this very warped production that helps drive the narrative along, and for many, this aesthetic appeal would have already been enough to get them through all 12-episodes. But thanks to some meaningful passages being brought up to supplement this nutty art-style later on, to many, the presentation only became a secondary reason to stick around instead.\\nAnd with a story as frenetic as this one, this style of presentation felt like one of those \"why haven\\'t anyone done this yet?\" kind of moments. Mob Psycho 100 is X-Men meet Ghostbusters.\\nShigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama, residential egghead and harborer of immense power, is our protagonist. As he bobs along with an expression that makes it clear that he\\'s not the sharpest knife in the drawer, he enters the office of his employer, Arataka Reigen. When he isn\\'t busy stealing your wallet to sell it back to you, Reigen and Mob forms a ghostbusting duo that runs around town exorcising evil spirits for profit. And when I say they exorcise evil spirits, I mean Mob does the work while Reigen thinks of new ways of swindling some sap out of their hard earned paycheck. And had that been the only thing going on in the story, there wouldn\\'t be much here to discuss, but thankfully, that\\'s only a jumping off point to what\\'s really important.\\nA dive headfirst into easily digestible symbology and subtext.\\nWhile adored the world over by critical thinkers and any reviewer worth their salt, allegorical content is usually received with mix reception by the general audience, in large part to the fact that said material requires a keen eye to make what\\'s being digested more engaging. Indie films don\\'t rake in big box office returns, the big brand-name Hollywood blockbusters do, and understandably so. The general audience simply wishes to be entertained, and where one requires more fixation on the details of the plot and what certain things may mean, the other promises none of that, instead offering an experience that\\'s as straightforward as the images on the screen would have you believe. In a way, that\\'s the difference between OPM and MP100; OPM makes bullet-point statements with no hidden agenda, while MP100 has fine print written into its spastic portrayal. And let\\'s not make any quick assumptions here, that\\'s not bad at all, simple programming is equally as needed as something with a bit more bite to it. One services everyone, while the other offers a second helping for those that want a bit more.\\nBut then there\\'s that weird breed of content. One that\\'s as direct as the big blockbusters, but at the same time, manages to slide another layer in for those that pick up on it. Something that appears to be a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, but when bitten into, has the texture and taste of something a bit more high-end.\\nWe\\'ve seen it with anime titles such as Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster, Abenobashi, and FLCL, and now MP100 has seemingly stepped up on the mantle to join their ranks, if only on a scale that\\'s not as far-reaching.\\nThis unexpected layer is found in the humorous scenarios, quick \"blink and you\\'ll miss it\" commentary, and the relationship Mob shares with his brother, Ritsu.\\nBeing hidden within the folds of blaring orchestrated set-pieces, comedic jabs at the situations that the characters are placed in, and the occasional factoids pertaining to the state of certain issues, you\\'ll find very quick cheeky retorts that draw into question the very nature of these kinds of narratives that are simply accepted by the masses. Where mini-boss battles are simply accepted as side conquests for smaller characters or obstacles that the protagonist has to plow through to meet the head honcho, in MP100, that very idea of thinking is sideswiped with a swift punch to the face and characters that are practically voicing the audiences\\' concern of \"just get to the boss battle already.\" Where the presence of a villainous organization full of henchmen being operated haphazardly is simply shrugged off as a byproduct of superhero stories, MP100 makes that very notion its reason for doing nothing short of walking through the front entrance without so much as a scuffle. And where we never questioned why megalomaniacs all come off as infuriatingly disturbed manchildren, MP100 doesn\\'t even think twice about having someone say \"These guys who are seriously talking about taking over the world are children who failed to grow up.\"\\nEvery jab towards these trends are delivered with pinpoint accuracy but never in a mean-spirited way that feels like the writers are cynically lampooning them. ONE has proven to be a fan of these accepted tropes and cliches but doesn\\'t shy away from addressing it for what it is. I can go on and on about moments like these, but the point is, MP100 is fully aware of the lunacy populating the very landscape of contemporary trends it has become a part of, while still fully embracing it to tell its own kooky version of the same kind of story.\\nAnd while this very tongue-in-cheek manner that MP100 operates on is worth discussing in lengthier detail, the true heart of the show\\'s content lies with Mob\\'s mental state and the relationship he shares with his brother.\\nMob, as a brother, is too dense to see the anguish felt by his little brother, Ritsu, while Ritsu himself is too focused on trying to surpass Mob that he loses focus on the fact that he\\'s admired by him, for reasons even someone as powerful as Mob himself can\\'t obtain. It\\'s the \"grass is always greener on the other side\" saying, but instead of them being delegated as enemies, they\\'re simply misunderstood. Each seeking a quality that the other has without registering the actuality of their own self-worth. Where Ritsu fosters all of the qualities of a well-acclimated socialite, his brother, unfortunately, possesses the charm of Bozo the Clown. A trait that\\'s only worsened by the increasingly negative reception that his powers tend to draw from others. What was once seen as an astonishing gift to some, was now only registered with blasé responses, or in worst case scenario, something that could endanger the lives of others. As a result, his already simple demeanor was reduced even further to a state that\\'s almost autistic (and no, I\\'m not saying that in a joking manner), since the one thing that made him unique was now bastardized, effectively boxing him into a corner with nothing left to turn to. But where others shunned or ignore him, his brother saw otherwise. He saw a gift he yearned for but couldn\\'t have. Despite being accepted by society, something his brother was robbed of, he still harbors a feeling of inadequacy when Mob levitates objects like it\\'s no big deal or causes his dinner spoon to bend like playdough.\\nJust the very duality between these brothers was enough to dissect already, this doesn\\'t even address the elephant in the room; Mob\\'s powers themselves.\\nThe title of Mob Psycho 100 quite literally refers to his power and what they mean, as it\\'s shorthand for what\\'s going on whenever he uses them. No one could suppress their emotions long enough before they hit a breaking point, and that\\'s essentially the idea presented here. But where that \"final straw\" is usually only presented through someone emoting, in MP100, it\\'s seen by a radiant burst of energy that exudes from every fiber of Mob\\'s being. A burst of energy that\\'s presented by a percentage scale that\\'s occasionally flashed onscreen, when the number hits 100%, this power manifests itself upon release with the emotion he was suppressing. Whether that be the guilt he feels for putting others in harm\\'s way or the animosity that boils over when someone dares to endanger his loved ones; every pent-up emotion is externalized into a colorful display of energy, feeling, and chaos.\\nIt\\'s simple ideas like this that adds a certain charming layer to MP100\\'s content. It doesn\\'t boast about its ideas nor does it tell you to take them seriously, it simply presents it for what it is and chooses to let the viewer take from it what they will. A kind of earnestness that goes a long way after witnessing other titles that flamboyantly boast their basic accomplishments. It\\'s a small change in approach, yet it makes all the difference. And that\\'s what this is as well; a simple idea but done so in a way that adds new meaning to what\\'s at face value, another beat-em-up with superpowers.\\nAnd with the understanding of these basic ideas, physical encounters become much more than empty fists clashing, they become a fight for something. Not all share in this quality, but for the ones that matter, there\\'s a reason for the audience to be genuinely invested in the outcome. In the schizophrenic world of MP100, it\\'s these very humanistic ideas that keep everything anchored behind the layer of jokes and satirical jabs.\\nEven characters like Reigen that would usually remain pigeonholed as the sleazy money-grubbing con-artist types are given a surprising amount of humanity by the time everything comes to its final stop. This doesn\\'t come from excessive showboating, it comes from observations made after seeing similar things play out. ONE\\'s innate understanding of tropes has allowed him the ability to work them into something straightforward and fun, yet clever without the need to reinforce that fact. Don\\'t get me wrong, this isn\\'t to say that the show is subtle; on the contrary, it\\'s very much on-the-nose 100% of the time. But what it is is humble about its ideas, not expressing some inherent birthright to be taken seriously just because it has something to say.\\nThis is the kind of landscape that ONE seems to be paving with each new undertaking, helping give birth to a mini-cultural zeitgeist in the medium. One where not taking yourself too seriously could be a commendable approach, while still having ideas that could please those interested in them. Simplicity delivered with a new flare. A compromise that could give rise to fun, yet thoughtful, projects like this one. It may just be a direct response to the superhero genre that\\'s dominating pop culture, but with results like this, I\\'m in full support for it. And with that in mind, Mob Psycho 100 is a welcomed addition to this blossoming trend.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e2496130d0f8bedcf5739d52b039bcfe'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Last year, One Punch Man rose to popularity and became of the most mainstream and popular anime of the current decade. However, the mangaka of One Punch Man also had another really good series that not many have heard about, Mob Psycho 100. With an adaptation for ONE’s other series, Mob Psycho 100 was also able to generate a good amount of popularity, due to it living off of One Punch Man’s brand. Though there might be some similarities between the two series, Mob Psycho 100 is quite different One Punch Man in a lot of ways. And it manages to create its own name,\\nrather than relying on the popularity of what its being compared too. Mob Psycho 100 is more original, well-written and thought-provoking than it initially seems.\\n~{Story}~\\nMob Psycho 100 is about an 8th grader psychic named Shigeo (also known as Mob) who tries his best to become a normal person by trying to fit into society. The story focuses on Mob and how he tries his best to control his powers and not cause any harm, while being in very risky situations. The story may seem a bit simplistic at first, and near the beginning it kind of is, but the series starts to get more complex and explores many themes like morality and what it means to be different. But the story just doesn’t focus on Mob, but also other characters too, like his mentor (who is a scammer) and his brother (who has an inferiority complex). At first the series has more of an episode/slice-of-life structure, but in the second half, the main story gets introduced. And also, a lot of the omake chapters from the manga got adapted, so you’ll be seeing some short stories revolving around Reigen and Mob throughout the series. The overall story doesn’t really end, since the manga is ongoing, but the final arc of this series wraps up nicely, while teasing what’s next to come. Hopefully it gets a second season to continue the series.\\nStory: 9/10\\n~{Presentation}~\\nMob Psycho 100 looks and feels a lot different from your normal anime. The style is very over-the-top, exaggerated and weird, and it matches the tone of the series. It’s supposed to be weird and quirky and its style isn’t something you will see often. But the series just isn’t a comedy as it is more than that. There are a good amount of moments in the series when things get a lot more serious and emotional. Unlike One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 expects you to take them seriously. However, they are handled in such a way that you as a viewer are aware that things aren’t being played for jokes anymore. The series switches between its tones very well and not once did it ever feel drastic. The art style is quite unique too, and that will be mentioned later in this review. Bones did a good job in adapting the manga, though it’s not the most perfect adaptation I’ve come to expect from a studio like them. Near the middle of the series, the pacing got a little fast and the buildup was a slight bit underwhelming. And too many unnecessary omake chapters are adapted and they ruin the flow of the series. But those are only minor gripes to what is an outstanding anime.\\nPresentation: 9/10\\n~{Character}~\\nWhat is probably the most impressive and surprising thing about Mob Psycho 100 is its characters. For those who were expecting another One Punch Man, were probably shocked at how well-written the characters are. Even as a One Punch Man fanboy myself, even I admit that most of the characters in One Punch Man aren’t really complex, they’re just fun and entertaining. Mob, our protagonist, starts off as an apathetic school boy who’s wants to fit in, but can’t due to his powers. He’s much more complex and well written than he seems. He can’t express his emotions because releasing them releases his powers. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone with his powers, but accidents do happen. He has a hard time in deciding what’s right and wrong or whether he should be selfish or selfless. The way he’s handled is amazing. Then we have Mob’s con-man mentor, Reigen. He may start off to be a little irritating, but his character is used well during comedic situations. And he’s more than what he seems too. Then we have Mob’s brother, Ritsu, who is also handled really well and his character change is believable. And there’s a bunch of side characters that are all used well for comic relief.\\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n~{Art}~,\\nIt doesn’t take long to realize that Mob Psycho 100 has a really, really unique art style. ONE was never a good artist and his web manga don’t look too good. Mob Psycho 100 was his best looking work, yet a lot of the panels can look cruddy or unorganized. However, this crude art added to the style of the series. Bones manages to adapt the art of the manga, while making it visually appealing. The crude look of the manga is still in the anime, but things look more detailed and organized. The zany art style adds to the comedic moments, and feels stylish during its action sequences. The backgrounds are pretty well done too. The character models look really unique, though they all have similar faces, just like the web manga. The art isn’t the most detailed, but doing so would ruin the style. However, the lighting and colors used in the series and the shadows are really well done.\\nArt: 9/10\\n~{Animation}~\\nIf there’s nothing that interests you in Mob Psycho 100, there’s always the stellar animations. Simply put, it’s the most well animated TV anime series I’ve seen, and yes, it’s better than One Punch Man. When I mean better, I mean that it is more fluid. Since the art style isn’t incredibly detailed, this lets the animators makes the animations as smooth as possible. During big fights, characters will be going all over the place and destruction would be happening very fluidly. The cinematography is also stellar and the way it moves during fights is very stylish. Sometimes the fights can feel overwhelming, due to how much is happening on the screen. And Bones extended most of the fights and made them longer, so they can have some more eye-candy visuals.\\nAnimation: 10/10\\n~{Voice Acting}~\\nThe seiyuu cast do a great job in doing the comic relief and executing the more dramatic moments. Mob’s seiyuu, Itou Setsuo, has barely done any voice acting before, as he only did one supporting role before and this is his first main role. But he doesn’t sound like a newbie at all as he does an excellent job as Mob. He gets the apathetic tone of his voice right, but he really shines when he has to add emotions to Mob. He does his angry voice really well and his seiyuu delivers during emotional scenes too. Sakurai Takahiro (who is doing a lot of voice acting recently) does Reigen and he does him perfectly. It’s well known that Sakurai’s a really talented seiyuu and he gives all he’s got as Reigen. He makes his character absurd, wacky, deceiving, and truly hilarious. Irino Miyu does a very good job as Ritsu and gets his emotional and strong-willed personality right. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu’s really at his best when he does supporting characters and him as Teruki was a perfect choice. And all of the other seiyuu also do a good job in what they have to do.\\nVoice Acting: 9/10\\n~{Music}~\\nThe music in Mob Psycho 100 is also really good and adds to the already amazing series. The OP, \"99\", is really good and catchy and I don’t need to say much about how the lyrics are quite matching for a series like this. Never did I thought that counting up to 100 could be so fun and addicting. The ED, \"Refrain Boy”, is also very good and it really matches the dramatic aspect of the series. The vocals, the lyrics and the music is great in that ED. The background music is also really good in the series, particularly the ones used during fights. The add more to the tension and make things more fun. The music used during a fight in the fifth episode was particularly good.\\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n~{Enjoyment}~\\nI knew I was going to enjoy Mob Psycho before it even aired. I really loved the web manga and the fact that Bones was going to animate it makes the chances of the anime being a good adaptation really high. And Bones surely did deliver. Though some of the omake chapters getting adapted ruined the flow, everything else was done perfectly well. The characters are really well developed and really well handled. They ended up being more complex than they originally seemed. The story itself is really good and manages to keep you interested most of the time. The way the humor and the seriousness is blended together makes sure that none of the tonal shifts feel jarring. I don’t think I’ll have this much fun again in a long time.\\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\nIn the end, if you haven’t checked out Mob Psycho 100 yet, then seriously, what are you doing? This is the most fun you’ll probably have this year, and it’s not wise to skip on it. Even those who didn’t like One Punch Man should definitely check this out because it’s quite a different anime and it’s much more complex than it originally seems. The characters are well developed and handled excellently. Mob’s struggle to make the right choices is presented fantastically. The art style is unique and adds to the wackiness. But most importantly, the animations are simply stunning and some of the best I’ve seen. Mob Psycho has all the ingredients to make an amazing anime and uses all of its potential. Mob Psycho 100 is easily a candidate for anime of the year, and if you haven’t checked it out yet, you should do so soon.\\n+ Handles its characters well and Mob is a really realistically done and complex character.\\n+ Amazing direction and conveys the style of the web manga perfectly.\\n+ Very unique art style and mind-blowing animations during major fights.\\n+ Properly blends its humor and wackiness with its emotional and dramatic scene.\\n+ Premise is simple, but the execution is really well done and the story starts to evolve in the second half.\\n- Pacing was a little fast in the middle and the adapted omake chapters break the flow.\\nOverall: 9.1/10', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '16eff42fdcba184302c12f5ae7b8c04b'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Hype has always been a double-edged sword, Mob Psycho 100 (I’ll use the abbreviation MP100 for the following) and One Punch Man (OPM) being an almost perfect example of that exact statement. MP100 never got that much attention since it started airing in the Summer Season 2016, being outclassed in popularity by shows like Orange, Shokugeki no Souma S2 and the ongoing Re:Zero in that respect, at least at the start of Summer season. It was never hyped as ‘the best thing evar’, nor did it receive much negative backlash because of that. Unlike MP100’s relative lack of popularity, the author\\'s other work One Punch\\nMan did get flooded by it, scoring points with similar style and humour, but in a more straight-forward and \\'blockbuster-like\\' way. While I think the hype and also the following negative backlash that OPM hit was a little excessive, MP100 does not deserve to stand in OPM’s shadow, as it offers new ideas and a more creative story than One Punch Man does, hinting and actually executing several thematical aspects decently, giving the show a unique identity despite the similarities.\\nPossible MINOR SPOILERS can be encountered while reading this review, although I will try to avoid diving into the plot any more than it is really necessary.\\nMob Psycho’s story follows the seemingly mundane daily life of our protagonist Shigeo Kageyama, called ‘Mob’ during the series, with exceptional psychic power, nowhere near to be matched by any other character in the story at first. However, Mob has a problem we all have during Middle School, namely troubles in finding himself, his true strength, goals, and love in life. He seeks help from someone who can understand his problems he has with his uncontrollable psychic powers and lost purpose in his life and finds it in his master and fake spirit-exorcist and con-artist Reigen Arataka, who surprisingly is quite a bit of help for Mob’s problems.\\nWhen reading the synopsis it is virtually impossible to not think of ONE\\'s more famous work, ringing a bell more than just about three times for people familiar with OPM\\'s protagonist Saitama, which not even only share a lot of connection when scrolling through the main description, but their stature as well, yelling the word \"average\" out loud. Contrary to their initial looks, both shows feature an overpowered protagonist in its own right, both seek for appreciation, but fail to do so. If MP100 is able to develop its own identity and tries to not harp on the same (now pretty old) joke that OPM successfully capitalized on, remained an incredible big question mark in my mind, even after watching the first episode. However, I was incredibly surprised by how more unique the show got from episode to episode, seemingly increasing the quality constantly, which might also be caused by their exceptional build-up for another. Additionally, the story does not rely on the \\'baseline-joke\\' for being funny, making it a more colorful and overall a little more enjoyable viewing experience in contrast to One Punch Man.\\nDescribing how it felt watching and analyzing the overall events and themes is a really difficult one, to begin with. The closest thing I could think of to summarize it rather compactly is \\'One Punch Man meets Yuasa\\'. The witty humour, quirky, expressive style and characters rich in contrast getting mixed up with the popular coming-of-age story in its essence definitely gets covered and presented very similarly by the famous director and undeniable genius Yuasa himself, who was responsible for works like \\'Ping Pong\\' and \\'Tatami Galaxy\\'. That being said, while it definitely isn’t as good as the previous works, watching the first few episodes, it felt similar to some extent. Character/Thematic exploration isn\\'t the main aspect of MP100 though since it\\'s main focus is still on the action and thrown-in comedic elements, which works perfectly in its balanced combination, where off-timed comedy was a real rarity. It\\'s more of a subtle reminder from time to time, but that does not feel forced in any way and only complements the specific style Mob Psycho beholds. At one point in the second half, I had the feeling the show would drift into the typical Shounen genericism like most shows do these days after initially promising starting episodes and would solve any problem in an uncreative manner, but I was utterly mistaken by how the show evolved afterwards, choosing an unexpected and yet fun way to bring the story further, leaving problems to be dealt with by the characters longer than to be expected, utilizing this said length to offer more thought-out and conclusive solutions to them.\\nThe script itself can be seen as rather mediocre and does not expand on several aspects which could’ve been dealt with in a deeper way and sometimes takes a little strange approach on flashing out different storylines like they did with the members of the student council. However, a ground-breaking script has never been the intention of MP100 in the first place and it certainly doesn’t need one. The presentation is what makes the show what it is, a fun ride and lovable ride from start to finish.\\nSpeaking of the presentation, the art style complements the storytelling and overall atmosphere splendidly, being yet another display of skill by the Animation-studio Bones. As the appeal of the show might not come through on the first episode, you’ll surely develop a liking towards the unusual and kinda trippy art style while watching it, complementing the overall atmosphere splendidly. In terms of fluent and simultaneously creative Animation, Bones flexes their muscles another time, with the Animation almost earning itself the adjective \\'perfect\\'. Nothing looks stiff and the fight scenes are unbelievably (!) well animated, making me wonder about how much budget they had actually spend. The backgrounds sometimes feel unlively, but as I’ve already stated it doesn’t bug me in the slightest and even adds to its overall unusual appeal.\\nAnother appeal the show truly has on its side is the characters with their quirky, sometimes over-the-top and sometimes pretty humble appearance. It seems ONE has already made himself a trademark with making his overpowered as hell protagonist to look as plain as possible in comparison to everyone else. Mob is another prime example of that, basically having Saitama’s design, but instead being of bald, he has the good ol\\' classic bowl-cut. Side characters like Teruki after the epic change in hairstyle, the bully of the 90\\'s impersonation Onigawara and the \\'Body Improvement Club\\' offer a good contrast to the modest appearance of all the other students, while the evil spirits obviously are still in a whole other league in terms of peculiar design compared to them.\\nCharacter development is written with a capital S in MP100, hence the characters don’t feel dull at all, even incorporating actually subtle hints on which their development is based on, which is very true for Mob-kun himself. That being said, not every development has been executed successfully, mainly thinking of Mob’s younger brother Shigeo. I acknowledge that his inferiority complex to Mob gets set-up decently, however, the actions which he decides to take and battle his inferiority seemed kinda forced to me, especially with the student council evolving in ‘Gestapo 2.0’, which was one of the weirdest things ever. It even breaks the loose boundaries MP100 set for itself, getting a little too eccentric, just thinking about how it would feel like in even little more down to earth show in terms of presentation would blow my mind. Also, he still remains rather shallow for all the development he gets during the series, making him be a mediocre character and a little let-down overall.\\nMuch on the contrary, Mob’s development is executed well and doesn’t seem artificial in any way. He gets influenced by both his master Reigen and his environment, having him to make decisions about his future, while he still doesn’t know what he genuinely wants to do. This makes for some truly hilarious moments in his interactions with other characters, like for example his thought-process behind which club to join at school.\\nOther side characters are likable in their own right, however, there’s nothing too noteworthy about them. Also, while I did make this statement regarding the side characters in general, I\\'m screaming \\'OBJECTION!\\' internally while saying this. Why? Because of Mob’s master Reigen, who is just too damn hilarious and the best addition to MP100’s witty and eccentric style in general, lifting the general appreciation I hold for MP100\\'s characters by a lot all by himself. He almost always ends up as the top-pick in likeability for people completed the series, because even though he is absolutely unskilled in the arts of spirit exorcism which he pretends to teach his student Mob, he manages to raise Mob’s self-esteem and courage in his actions, truly able to take over the role of a mentor for Mob.\\nThe production values for this show are top-notch, so not only the Animation is fantastic, but also the department taking care of the sound did a magnificent job. The OP/ED are fantastic earworms, the OP even able to snatch a place in my top 10. Additionally, the soundtrack is of overall high quality, leaving me waiting the OST finally gets released, to look up a certain track which gets played during fight scenes, giving me One Punch Man vibes all over again.\\nConclusion:\\nMob Psycho 100 definitely takes the cake for me this Summer season, earning itself the title ‘Anime of the Season’ rightfully. Refreshing style, quirky characters, witty jokes, Reigen’s special moves, great production values and overall solid, simple storytelling mixed with subtle thematic exploration make this Anime to what I consider a must-see for fans of the genre and skeptics alike. While it does have certain flaws regarding the script and some strange decision-making by key-characters, they remain rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things, maybe solely due to the magnificent entertainment-value Mob Psycho offers in its runtime.\\nSo now it’s time to say farewell with an ANTI ESPER-DROPKICK! Have fun with Mob Psycho!\\nStory (6.5/10)\\nArt (9/10), Animation (9.5/10)\\nSound (8.5/10)\\nCharacters (7/10)\\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\nOverall (8/10)', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bc5bf804746c416354b2bce2c8ae0d16'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that in\\nthis review, because I know anybody checking this review will be curious how it looks next to it.\\nOne obviously made the decision when writing Mob Psycho 100 to have this series take itself a little more seriously. Because of this, I feel the characters are a lot more fleshed out than One Punch Man. We have serious character building arcs in this series, something I didn't expect in the slightest. Another refreshing thing is that (in my opinion) Shigeo isn't much like Saitama. Sure, he's overpowered, but he doesn't have much of Saitama's irreverence. Despite the series revolvling around Shigeo being emotionless, I feel he cares quite a bit. But this series doesn't just focus on him. For the most part, the entire cast gets some time to shine. Aside from Shigeo, the characters I feel stood out the most are Reigen, Ritsu, and Hanazawa. This series is not lacking at all in the character department.\\nThe artstyle to me came off like a mix of One Punch Man, and an adult swim late-night cartoon. It was trippy in all the right ways at times, and it's animation style lended itself to some great matches. The characters may not be as sharp looking as a series from Trigger or Gainax, but I feel I enjoy One's style just as much as those studios. It's also very consistent. I can't recall anytime I thought the animation looked poor. I think because they went with the exact style the manga must have, it made that very easy to accomplish. It's only flashy when it needs to be.\\nThe storyline among other things is about our protagonist's emotions and how much he conceals his powers. It's hard to describe it in depth without spoiling, but I can say they accomplish what they were going for very well.\\nI believe that Mob Psycho 100 is the greatest anime of 2016. Not only did (in my opinion) it surpass One Punch Man in quality, but it also surpassed many of the series that I didn't think would be topped this year. I like this series so much in fact, it's surpassed many of my long time favorite series, and is currently number one on my profile. I can't give Mob Psycho 100 anything but a strong 10.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ab6c14e398cfa4afd3a942759e5e1406'}>,\n",

People are always complaining about how anime is always the same: boys that can travel back in time, tsundere protagonists or MMORPG worlds.\\nMob Psycho 100 tells the story of an overpowered boy who doesn\\'t know he\\'s overpowered.  About a boy that doesn\\'t feel special just because he has powers.  He instead wants to become more popular and more fitting to other humans.\\nStory 10/10\\nI thought MP100 was similar to OPM since the protagonists is an overpowered esper that can deal with\\nalmost any evil spirit.  But after some episodes, the anime tells you the story of an underdog.  A guy who doesn\\'t feel special just because he can defeat spirits.  He is a humble boy who wants to be better in other ways.   Mob is in love with a girl and he wants to impress her, but he knows his powers are not the way to impress a girl.  Mob is given the opportunity to join the \"esper club\" but he is not interested in that.  In conclusion, Mob is a boy who wants to overcome his own insecurities that happens to be a powerful esper.\\nCharacter 10/10\\nCharacters are so funny and likeable.  Apart from Mob, we have Reigen (Mob\\'s master), Ritsu (Mob\\'s brother) , Dimple and some other characters that join later.  The story takes a lot of comedy twists and they totally work.  Reigen is a smart con man that always knows how to deal with every situation.  Also, he\\'s very caring towards Mob.  Ritsu is a boy who feels overshadowed by his brother, but learns to overcome that during the plot development.\\nArt and Sound 10/10\\nThe animation is impressive.  The fights look so damn great and epic.  Contrary to OPM, real fights actually happen and they look fine! The music is astonishing and the opening is not bad either.\\nOverall 10/10\\nMob Psycho 100 has a lot of perks: good animation, good story, good character development and it also comes as one of the best comedy shows out there.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Mob Psycho 100 is based off of a manga by ONE. Yes, the same manga artist behind One Punch Man. The anime came out last year and was brought to us by Bones. Yes, the Soul Eater, Heroman, Wolf's Rain, etc... Studio. So, is this one okay like One Punch Man, better or worse?\\nStory:\\nMob is a young man with psychic powers. His master, Reigen, is a con artist who pretends to have psychic abilities. Together, they get paid to go out and exorcise spirits. Shenanigans ensue and Mob's counter raises towards 100. What will happen when it goes all the way up? Will Mob\\never find others like himself? Will he ever discover that his master is a fraud?\\nThe biggest issue with the series is the comedy. A lot of it is either really obvious or just random nonsense. There are very few funny moments to be found. The whole narrative is also similar to One Punch Man in that it likes to build up some kind of confrontation for Mob, but then he settles it with relative ease once he gets worked up enough to actually fight. The big difference is that it's considerably less competent here.\\nThe best I can say about the story is that it has its occasional moment. It has a few funny scenes and some more serious parts that are pretty decent.\\nCharacters:\\nThe characters in this fall woefully short. Mob is mainly defined by being thick. His brother's main feature is his mix of admiration and jealousy towards Mob for his amazing psychic powers. There are a couple scenes that showcase the dynamic between Mob and Reigen that come close to making it decent.\\nArt:\\nThe artwork does have some good and bad elements. On one hand, a lot of the psychic power scenes are pretty visually creative. On the other hand, the character designs are boring and lazy. The backgrounds are usually weak and a lot of the action sequences are weakened by being a bit of a hard to follow mess.\\nSound:\\nThis is a series that suffers from extremes in the acting. You get a lot of characters being really exaggerated and a lot of actors sounding completely uninvested. Itou Setsuo especially. There isn't much in terms of middle ground that allows the cast to show that they can actually act. Kawai Kenji's soundtrack for this isn't bad. It's not good either. It's a pretty average work. His tracks for Bakuretsu Hunters and Ghost in the Shell were definitely better.\\nHo-yay:\\nThere really isn't any. The most we get in terms of romance is Mob having a crush on the most easily impressed girl ever. Which is weird because we only see her talk with her in flashback and even then it's about five lines. I guess when you're a dullard that's enough to create a fixation.\\nFinal Thoughts:\\nMob Psycho 100  is pretty stupid, and not in an entertaining way. The story is dumb. The jokes are largely unfunny, stupid humour. The characters are morons. It's certainly not on par with One Punch Man and, frankly, it's the worst thing I've reviewed by Bones. If you liked One Punch Man you may want to give it an episode or two. Maybe it'll work better for you than it did for me. But, for myself, I give it a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Tales of Zestiria the X.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '43e434286e5a495e752267604da8cb64'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"(spoiler-free review)\\nMob Psycho was a show I really wanted to enjoy. After I heard about it from one of my friends, I searched it up to see if it would be worth my time. Everyone had great things to say about it, and some even went as far as to say it was the greatest anime of all time. This, however, was not the case for me.\\nFirstly, I'd like to talk about the positive traits of this show because although I didn't enjoy the series that much, there are still a few things I enjoyed.\\nArt/Animation:\\nLet me say this: Mob Psycho 100 has the\\nmost ridiculous, in your face, outright crazy art style, but that's what makes it so great. Right after seeing the first frame, I was instantly turned off from the strange and wacky animation, but later on, it really grew on me. It works really well with the characters and comedy of the show, and I thought it was the best part. Overall I give the art an 8/10.\\nSound:\\nThe shows sound is good as well. I felt like the sound really fit the scenes and made the show much more watchable. In some moments the music completely changed the tone of the story (along with the art of course), and all in all, it wasn't bad. Overall I give the sound a 7/10.\\nCharacters:\\nAccording to most people, the characters in this show are AMAZING, and I agree... that one of the characters is amazing (I'm not going to say who, but his name might start with Re). Aside from that one character, I feel like I missed something out of the others. In fact,  I found most of them to be quite cringe-worthy and/or decent characters. If you watch the show, you might just wanna come back here and kill me for saying that, but I'm being completely honest. If you wanna message me and explain why you think they're great, feel free to add me! Overall I give the characters a 7/10.\\nAnd now we get into the - not so good part of Mob Psycho.\\nStory/Plot:\\nTHIS part of the show is what really brings my rating down. I love myself a good ass story. If the story isn't good, the chances of me liking the show go down quite a bit. Having watched/read titles such as Death Note, Code Geass, One Piece, and Oyasumi Punpun (which are all amazing stories that I highly recommend), this mediocre story seriously kills the series for me. I understand that some shows aren't supposed to have crazy plots, and I have definitely enjoyed many shows that aren't story-driven, however, Mob Psycho has so many pointless and boring episodes, that it almost seems like some episodes are just fillers. Maybe I'm missing something, and the story is actually fantastic, but I have yet to find that missing piece. Overall I give the story a 5/10.\\nTo conclude, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch Mob Psycho. Sure, lots of people think very highly of the show, and some people can't stop talking about it, but in my opinion, it's a little over-hyped and the story needs to be worked on. As I mentioned, the series is loved by many, so it probably isn't a waste of time to check out. I'm just a random anime guy, so watch whatever you'd like!\\nOverall rating: 6/10\\n(thanks for reading this!)\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '144b43960e5b60ed854f777e9eaa6843'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Mob Psycho 100 was LA\\'s favourite anime of Summer 2016 and really it pulled it off, bringing in a two for two for ONE, the creator of One Punch Man, so what made Mob Psycho 100 another great like One Punch Man?, well it\\'s a bit complicated to say the least...let\\'s find out.\\nMob Psycho 100 looks at both the stress of the youth, superiority and inferiority complexes and the look at how having powers isn\\'t what is all that is cracked up to be...which is also becoming something of a trend these days like Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan this season to. Mob Psycho 100 all\\nwraps this up under the notion of Kageyama Shigeo (a.k.a. \"Mob\") voiced by Setsuo Itou who holds his psychic power under check unless he literally explodes it in any manner of varying emotions and trying to find meaning in his ironically normal life.\\nMob Psycho 100\\'s plot pacing (and comedic timing) just feels like an bomb explosion with setup, exposition and character development as the long thread that is lit, Mob Psycho 100 for as much as a rather ironic anime (main protagonist suppressing his powers) it still has some profound meaning and character development which helps make this anime more than a typical shounen anime. Mob Psycho 100 isn\\'t as much as a deconstruction of being a superpowered human like One Punch Man as it is a coming of age and \"what youth does to you\" and for the shounen element side of things, \"power isn\\'t everything, be it if your a villain or a superpowered normy\".\\nIn terms of characters, we have our comedic foils to the main protagonist like the con-man mentor of Arataka Reigen voiced by Takahiro Sakurai to more serious characters like Ritsu voiced by Miyu Irino, Mob\\'s little brother and Dimple voiced by Akio Ootsuka an evil spirit turned Mob\\'s \"spiritual advisor\" with all his evil intentions still intact, don\\'t worry he gets better. There was also Teruki Hanazawa voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka a rival to Mob who abuses his psychic powers, again he gets better. If there was a character who got the most development, it would go to both Mob and Ritsu as their developments were polar opposites in terms of how they used their powers and how they deal with their stress. Unfortunately, Mob Psycho 100\\'s minor cast are cliche or support like Mob\\'s love interest Tsubomi voiced by Uki Satake to the purist with evil intentions student council president Shinji Kamuro voiced by Kouji Yusa and Tome Kurata voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki the club leader of the Telepathy Club and just a slacker like the rest of club members. Overall, as much as the minor cast members were support, they at least somewhat helped move the pot forward, even indirectly. Where Mob Psycho 100\\'s strengths comes in is in the majority of the main cast (Mob, Reigen, Ritsu, Hanazawa and Dimple) as they do get the majority of the screentime. What\\'s better is that these character\\'s chemistry as bizarrely disjointed they are, they actually meld together, be it comedically or dramatically (or more precisely be a catalyst to Mob\\'s varying \"100%\" emotions). LA\\'s favourite character easily goes to Reigen by the end of the anime, which comes unexpectedly for LA as LA just went with Mob due his badassness.\\nThe animation done by Studio Bones if anything was an experiment in the uncanny comic styling, LA can\\'t quite put it into detail, but the animation is uncanny, but visually it makes it stand out for it\\'s uniqueness. Where does the animation shine?...well when Mob uses his psychic powers (a la once he reaches 100%)...it is utterly GLORIOUS to the point and it\\'s not only in Mob\\'s battles, the battle scenes in general are GLORIOUSLY AMAZING, sure it\\'s uncanny but it\\'s unique to as the least. LA will say that Mob Psycho 100 was the best animation for Summer 2016.\\nMob Psycho 100 goes into a more serious plotline further down the line and really, LA thought it compensated for the somewhat slow beginning and more meaningful episodes about youth to ramp it up by the last half by focusing more on a serious plot with numerous battles to test Mob and his \"friends\", and really it is a good compensation by the latter half, with less on the meaningful look at those with superpowers and youth to some awesome battles and sure you can complain that Mob would quite easily take down the threat that arose in the serious plotline and you\\'d be right...and wrong. Right as Mob can easily take down the \"strongest\" foe without trying, but mentally, he\\'s a bit different from the typical \"OP protagonist\". Overall the serious plotline is a nice bonus to have and really it\\'s just pointing out that Mob Psycho 100 ironically is having fun by making a serious plotline with some bombastic battles left, right and centre. This serious toned plotline however gets quickly back to it\\'s tone in the earlier episodes once Reigen appears as well as make a realistic impression on the \"evil\" Claw 7th Division.\\nAs much as this anime has contexts of being an \"OP main protagonist anime\", yes it is but it\\'s one where the main protagonist knows about his own power and always tries to suppress it unless as a last resort to, if anything Mob Psycho 100 is a deconstruction of THIS trope and really we WANT to see Mob reach 100% and see him go batshit crazy with his powers which makes the \"OP main protagonist anime\" pitfalls almost nonexistent.\\nIn terms of voice acting, you\\'d kinda expect LA to bash the voice acting for it\\'s rather lackluster voice acting especially coming from Mob himself voiced by Setsuo Itou, but you realize that he\\'s SUPPOSE to repress his emotions to keep his emotions via powers in check. This diverse voice cast goes all over the board in terms of vocal toning and really LA actually enjoyed the voice acting VERY much, LA\\'s favourite voice actor goes to  Takahiro Sakurai as the con-man Reigen for MANY reasons.\\nThe ending was unexpected to say to least and LA wasn\\'t really expecting the \"big finale\" that One Punch Man did, sure it did a very cool \"final battle\" but the \"ending result\" was unexpected to say the least and ended as \"anti-climatically\" but LA didn\\'t care. Firstly Mob Psycho 100 isn\\'t the same as One Punch Man, secondly, it kinda the expected tone Mob Psycho 100 to have, it\\'s not anti-climatic to say but it\\'s was a great way to resolve the \"serious tone\" and still be \"Mob Psycho 100\". Sure the ending still has one plot thread that it brings up hinting at a second season, but for what this ending did, it was still greatly satisfying as much as it had an \"anti-climax\" final battle.\\nLA said it before at the start of this review, Mob Psycho 100 was LA\\'s favourite anime of Summer 2016 and it really shows, if One Punch Man was the thing for you, then Mob Psycho 100 is also a definite watch even if the anime is completely different from One Punch man with it\\'s own meaning and collapse of \"superiority and power\" as well as \"youth and the stress of it all\" and of course, Mob Psycho 100\\'s uncanny animation that was just utterly unique in the season 2016.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b07fd358bd00050291a26002fd6dd0de'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Wow... trying to come up with a compelling first sentence sure is hard... I'll just take a moment to myself before I start.\\n...97, 98, 99, 100... *BOOM*\\nStory:\\nIf you're familiar with the original artist, you can basically guess that the story will be good. Mob psycho was no exeption. It doesn't have a clear plotline from the start (Though we do get that later) and has an episodic structure. For me, the story didn't really strike untill episode 6, when we actually get to the ”real” plot.\\nThe story itself is very comical, filled with crazy situations and eastereggs for the audience to pick up. But\\nthat's not all the show has to offer, Mob psycho varies very smoothly from those comic situations to the deeper moments, inner dilemmas with the characters and the action sequences that were purely amazing. The comedy itself, is very ”ONE” if that makes sense. Simple, not too forced, though that depends greatly on your own sense of humor.\\nI would have loved giving Mob psycho a full 10 on the story, but the fact that the story took half of it's run time to really get the plot going, is something I can't ignore, so from story, i give it\\n8/10.\\nArt:\\nThis is something that strikes me everytime, I've hear people dropping this show because of it's art. Fine, I can see, why people would dislike the art, but for me it was not the case.\\nFor me the art was amazing. Taken what the manga looks like, the animation was executed nearly perfectly. On the cheerful/comical moments the animation stays simple, harsh like the original material, but oh my God when it's time to battle, let me tell you, they pull all the stops. While sticking to its rather rough appearense, it manages to make the fight scenes flow smoothly, filled with epicness. It's very hard to describe.\\nFor me, the art was solid\\n10/10\\nSound:\\nI'll be honest. Other than the opening and ending songs, I don't remember much of the soundtrack. What I do remember is that one electrical riff that plays everytime shit is about to get real. But honesty, I don't think I have to remember anything else.\\nThe opening and ending songs fitted the show nicely, the opening gave me an exiting, explosive vibe, and the ending was a nice calm counter measure for that.\\nBut the fact that nothing else but those three stuck with me, bothers me so much, that I can't give the sound a full score, even though those three were on point.\\n8/10\\nCharacters:\\nMuch like the artist previous masterpiece, One punch man, Mob psycho has a rather large cast, but thankfully, the series doensn't even try to focuse on all of the. So for this review, I could point out 3 characters that get the most screentime and development, also known as the main characters. If you don't want to read those, my point is, that the cast is very much amazing, the characters (atleast the main 3) have development and each have their own psychological dilemmas to deal with, though some more than the others, but still, it's there.\\nKageyama ”Mob” Shigeo: Mob, the obvious protagonist of the series. He is calm and collective, blank faced psychic user, though at times shy and a little naive teenage boy, so nothing we haven't seen before. For me, the most fascinating part of him, was to see the contrast of his character, how he could go from a wimpy goody-two-shoes character to a psychic rage monster in a matter of seconds. That gave some more sides to him, including his inner dilemma, not wanting to hurt anyone, but at the same time not being able to control himself.\\nKageyama Ritsu: Mobs little brother, whom I unfortunately can't speak too much without going to spoilerific territory. Lets just say, he's the ideal brother character. Honorable student, polite to everyone and looks up to his older brother. Personally Ritsu was my favourite character in the show, atleast after episode 6, when they actually started to develop his character, (and boy did they develop) and the direction it took.\\nReigen Arataka: Mobs boss, a con artist, who runs an exorcism business. Do I have to say more? To me Reigen was a very interesting character. Jack of all trades, master of none. Being verbally skilled and a tad melodramatic, he managed to pull off quite the amazing show. And after those couple last episodes I would just like to do a quick salute by saying ”Reigen, u da real mvp!”\\nThere would be a couple of more characters that I could mention, but I won't.\\n9/10\\nEnjoyment:\\nMy enjoyment of the show must have seen through the whole review, but I'm going to say it once more. I definelty enjoyed Mob psycho 100. The fact that the plot started only halfway did bother me a bit, but taken that I still managed to like the first half, because if I truly hadn't liked it, I wouldn't have continued watching. So, being a generous person, I'm going to forgive the show for that.\\nONE has a habit of putting over powered characters in his series, and honesty I'm more than fine with that. For one, I happen to enjoy watching an op character go on a full on rampage much more than those where the main character struggles till the very end and then  manages to win because of ”the power of friendship” or something like that.\\n10/10\\nOverall:\\nMob psycho 100 is a great show, with funny moments, deep thoughts and more than anything, epic battles, and I could easily recommend this show to anyone.\\nThe avarage that I got was 9 points, but I still decided to give it the grade of 10, because I think it truly deserves it.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f9fc5b67adb8b6f5863224b7e73bb135'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': 'This show is an absolute treat. As many already know, Mob Psycho 100, based on the web manga by ONE, shares many aspects with his One Punch Man series and the subsequent adaptation. However, while OPM is immensely entertaining due to the overwhelming strength of its protagonist, Mob Psycho 100 takes a more refined look at its characters and produces a show that not only reaches but surpasses the heights of its sister series.\\nStory: 6\\nMob\\'s story is nothing too special, and luckily it doesn\\'t need to be. Mob is an awkward, dull, incredibly overpowered esper struggling his way through the social nightmare that is middle\\nschool. In the meantime, he works for fraud exorcist-for-hire Reigen (a phenomenal character, but I\\'ll get to that). The story ends up boiling down to Mob demolishing tougher and tougher opponents by becoming uncontrollably powerful any time he gets worked up. It works on a quickly paced arc-based structure that succeeds most of the time and feels a bit rushed at others like the arc that follows Mob\\'s brother Ritsu. The final few episodes hit a great stride and are impeccably paced.\\nArt: 9\\nThis show looks absolutely stunning most of the time. Adapting from material as crudely drawn as ONE\\'s works would take a massive amount of talent. BONES has just that talent. The art style hits a perfect sweet spot by utilizing rough looking character designs with rugged lines and a GOD-TIER level of polish in action sequences that makes for some of the most kinetic fights I\\'ve witnessed in animation. Seriously, some of the scenes in this show are jaw-droppingly awesome. The crew at BONES also isn\\'t afraid to used mixed animation styles to convey a visual message. Some segments utilize a paint-on-glass style that looks amazing and unique. The entire ending animation is done in this style and is one of the most impressive ED\\'s I\\'ve ever seen for that very reason.\\nSound: 9\\nSpeaking of the ED, the music associated with this show is just too badass not to commend. The opening theme credited to a band simply named \"MOB CHOIR\" is a catchy driving techno rock track that hooked me instantly. The ED by \"ALL OFF\" is similarly great and sends off every episode perfectly. I have a feeling it will be a very nostalgic ED for me very soon.\\nNow the soundtrack. It\\'s by Kenji Kawai. Kenji Kawai is an absolute boss. I needn\\'t say anything else, but the man is a fantastic OST composer. His use of a variety of traditional instruments, electronics, a multitude of percussion instruments, and electronic instruments is always effective. The battle music is intense and kicks ass. The sullen moments are beautiful and emotionally written. Tracks can be used repetitively, but that is a common occurrence in anime. He\\'s awesome. Quick plug for the Seirei no Moribito OST, another great score he wrote for another great show. Alright. Enough rambling.\\nCharacter: 9\\nMan, the characters in this show are so fun. I think the biggest takeaway I had from these characters was just how good-spirited they all were. Any character you thought could be written off as \"just some jerk\" ended up being really pleasant and like-able. The members of the Body Improvement Club could have been rude and unaccepting of someone as out of shape and traditionally \"uncool\" as Mob, but instead they openly welcome him and treat him with care and respect. Teru could have remained an uncompromisingly pompous prick, but instead turns into an honestly good guy who is willing to help Mob. Dimple, though seemingly bent on world domination, helps Mob and offers him advice after Mob defeats him.\\nAnd then there\\'s Reigen. A fraud, con-artist, and outright liar who tricks people into paying for his services is virtually the coolest most genuinely good-hearted character in the whole show. He takes Mob, an insecure middle schooler struggling with his powers, under his wing and provides him with advice that inadvertently affects his entire world-view for the better. Reigen alone makes this show worth watching, and if you\\'ve read what I\\'ve written above, then you know there are MANY things that make this show worth watching.\\nEnjoyment: 9\\nAs I\\'ve already said, this show is a treat. Studio BONES has crafted an exceptional adaptation of a story that may have flown well under the radar otherwise.\\nOverall: 8\\nAs exciting as One Punch Man and packed with fun and interesting characters, Mob Psycho 100 is the best show I watched this season. With only 12 episodes (but hopefully more to come), this fun ride is well worth your time.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9d75864e18d9cf40b20073ba32507ad8'}>,\n",

       "  <Document: {'content': '[7.0/10]\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMob Psycho 100 - Wacky, decisive, entertaining, subversive, and occasionally funny. With the constant influx of Shounen anime that pours out of the pores of the industry, you\\'d expect that a plethora of parodies would release every season. But no, for some reason parody is kind of rare. Even shows marketed as parody, like KonoSuba rarely actually do any substantial and biting parodying. While Mob Psycho doesn\\'t really go the route of being a full-on parody, it does have satirical elements through subversion.\\nFor the most part, it points out the ridiculousness of a lot of similar Shounen action through it\\'s own storytelling. It lampoons\\nthrough doing something completely different, which, to its credit, is a very unique way to create a defining image for yourself. Mob Psycho 100 utilizes common Shounen tropes to enhance a theme that it builds on throughout the entire show.\\nSelf-improvement and actualization.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n[Dynamic Art]\\nIf you simply want to watch some great action, then this show can suite your needs as well. Mob Psycho has one of the most impressive animation showcases I\\'ve ever seen in a television anime, with absolutely gorgeous and fluid animation throughout. It never felt as though the show had a dip in quality in that regard. Even if the the action itself may feel as though it\\'s generic, as in, it has a formula that a seasoned action anime viewer has seen before, the animation elevates it. Before I even touch on the story itself, I want to make it clear that in animation, exceptional visuals really do create an entirely new appreciation for what you are watching.\\nUndoubtedly, if this show had average or below-average effort put into the action, which ends up taking up a big part of the whole show, then the amount of enjoyment I would\\'ve gotten would be substantially lower. This can be explained simply. If you want to have your show be action packed, then you better be ready to make that action a delight to look at. Whether through great direction, nimble audio design, or just spectacular animation.\\nThankfully, 100 has all of these things. The entire show is rough-looking and much less polished than a lot of battle anime, but what it doesn\\'t have in standalone visuals, it makes up for in movement and fluidity. With simpler character designs, this show can contort and bend them to their will. They bend like metal spoons and create uncommonly dynamic action.\\nThe direction is also solid. While it isn\\'t particularly standout, it has moments of captivating imagery through engaging motion within the metaphoric camera that the director is working with. There are a lot of shots that have you, the viewer, move through the environments observing the unfolding action. Instead of giving you a more whole image of what\\'s happening, you are thrust into a barrage of mid-shots and close-ups, which may have looked too confusing and headache inducing if the director didn\\'t understand his craft.\\nI was initially thrown off by the sound design. Mainly because the OP really didn\\'t jive all too well with me. The opening itself is fine, i\\'d say it\\'s above average for an anime opening, but the music in said opening is kind of silly. What with the corny English. But I will give credit where it\\'s due and say that the opening does actually connect itself to the theme of the show, which i\\'ll get into later. The audio overall though? Beautiful. The show has an aggressively awesome stinger track that it plays when shits really starting to go down that is really hype. Something about whining synths really gets me going. The sound design is also solid throughout. Since there\\'s a lot of movement, there needs to be a lot of syncing with said movement. The action is fast and the sounds are crisp. Characters often smash face-first into brick walls, cracking them into rubble and it sounds great.\\nArtistically, the show is spectacular.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n[Thematic Narrative]\\nSo in most Shounen battle anime you have your protagonist. And he\\'s cool and Kirito and broody and duel-wielding and edgy and spiky-haired and sexy and has a long black coat and has a non-caring but actually caring personality. We\\'ve seen it all before. These \"cool\" MC\\'s are one of the main reasons I generally stay away from action anime. Their innocuous and banal entirety is a huge turnoff, especially since every bland cardboard cutout girl ends up draped over them like a wet tarp.\\nShigeo, our protagonist, is similarly non-caring yet caring. He\\'s distant. But all these tropes are acknowledged, not in the winking \"hey we know we are doing this stupid bullshit\", kinda way. But in a literal story kind of way. These are actually problems. For once, these battle Shounen aren\\'t saying these traits are attractive. Early on in the series it\\'s established that Shigeo is not only ridiculously powerful, but emotionally distant. He hates that about himself. His crush is more interested in athletic guys than she is in emotionally unavailable quite boys with crazy magic powers.\\nBut instead of just saving her and getting the pussy, like what most of these shows would do. Shigeo acknowledges this and tries to improve himself. These aren\\'t just traits you have to live with. These are flaws you can fix if you work hard enough. From the second episode the ongoing theme of this series becomes apparent. Self-improvement is awesome.\\nThroughout the series he fights. If you\\'ve ever seen battle anime then you\\'d know that he\\'ll be fighting increasingly powerful enemies with his crazy over powered abilities and then it leads to a out-of-this world climax. What Mob Psycho 100 does so intelligently is use that obvious buildup to have this theme not only be there in the background, but enter the foreground of this narrative.\\nIt becomes clear that the enemies Shigeo is facing are powerful espers who, much like him, have social issues. Different social issues, but social issues nonetheless. But unlike him, they don\\'t want to change or better themselves. So in a cathartic kind of way, Shigeo is fighting anime protagonists from other series\\'. Kind of. Especially towards the middle half of the show as he faces the first true esper he has come into contact with. This parallel is, put bluntly, really fun.\\nThis self-improvement theme continues with Shigeo\\'s mentor in telekinesis, Reigen, being nothing but a con-man. This con-man, however, is genuinely a nice guy who disperses nuggets of wisdom throughout his mostly comedy-focused act. He is dangerously charismatic and convincing and cool, which are all the things that Shigeo wants to be. This parallel continues with Shigeo\\'s spouse, too, which plays a major role in this series.\\nHonestly, this theme does get stretched thin, as in, becomes really really obvious as the show progresses. So much so that at one point towards the end it is explicitly explained to you. But in a way, that\\'s alright, especially when i\\'m considering the demographic that this show really should flourish within. Teenagers. I feel as a teenager i\\'d be really into a show like this. In fact, i\\'d go so far as to say that this could be a very mandatory viewing to teenagers who are very into battle anime. Especially introverted kids who begin to think that their introverted-ness is due to some special power or hidden ability and the world will, at some point, hand all the answers to them. In reality, that\\'s far from the truth and Mob Pyscho 100 could be that pill that breaks them free of those kinds of thoughts.\\nThis genuinely smart, thoughtful, and refreshing message is perhaps this shows strongest narrative angle.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n[The Cons of Being]\\nUnfortunately, the downside of being a show that lampoons through narrative are also in full effect. I do want to say that this shows entire point is not to make fun of Shounen action anime, as much as it is to tell a story that simply serves as a refreshing take on the genre. However, these connections need to be drawn regardless since critically, the stories aren\\'t too different.\\nThe biggest flaws are that when this show isn\\'t engaging you with these thematic narratives it really just follows the path of a generic Shounen. As I\\'ve said, this could be easily forgiven if I actually enjoyed Shounen. But the gauntlet-style action that really becomes the norm towards the end of the series gave me vibes that weren\\'t really all too engaging. The subversive moments were fun, but they were far from the meat of the final episodes of the show.\\nAlso, throughout its twelve episode run, there was a small dip in narrative tightness towards the later middle-half that impacted the shows flow. Especially beginning these corruption oriented stories that really didn\\'t have reasonable or interesting conclusions. A lot of the side characters also never really played much of a role at all, which I was a little disappointed in.\\nThere was also an annoying ghost side-character that generally served as comedic relief. The comedy in just about every Shounen action anime always ends up being more miss-than-hit for me, which kind of sucks. This show, surprisingly, did ring a few laughs out of me but for the most part, I really didn\\'t care for the solely comedic scenes in the series. When it blended comedy with it\\'s action it became much more palatable.\\nThere were also a few moments in which there was some truly obnoxious character baits that didn\\'t go anywhere. I despise when shows do this and it\\'s very rare that they actually have any effect other than momentary surprise, only to realize that everything is just going to be fine in the end. This is because by the end of the show, the status quo is generally very samey. While some people definitely got powers, there were some cheap narrative shots taken to make sure everything wraps up a bit too neatly, setting up a potential second season.\\nI wish this show took more risks with finishing it\\'s story. Hell, kill off a character or two. This show, while comedic in nature, never really felt like it was beyond having powerful scenes. Especially since it does try and get you in the emotion-bone every so often with some of the flashbacks and heartfelt moments. Unfortunately... that\\'s where the emotional attachment ends. The characters and their general characterization balances the line between generic and semi-creative, with some characters being genuinely fun and engaging, while other characters being a bit too generic for this shows premise.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n[Conclusion]\\nOverall, Mob Psych 100 is probably the best Shounen battle anime I\\'ve seen so far. I haven\\'t watched the other series this creator has written, One Punch Man yet, but with how impressed Mob Psycho left me, maybe it\\'s about time I check that out. I think for it\\'s various flaws, Mob\\'s strong themes and incredible visuals elevate it past a lot of action anime that I\\'ve seen.\\nThere are some legitimately great moments here that unfortunately cluster around the first half more than they do the second half of this shows run-time. However, the show as a whole is so short that I felt like this wasn\\'t as big of an issue as it could\\'ve been. The length really did do it a lot of favors. The breezy duration made even the less-than-interesting parts easy to get through.\\nI think Mob psycho 100 is mandatory viewing for Shounen action fans. It brings an element of creativity in a genre that I feel, narratively, has been very stagnant and similar. Mob Psycho goes the extra mile with entertaining action, tying together crisp audio, solid direction, and great animation into a thematically resonant twelve-episode bundle.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9e3acae7227443dc000a792b0e5eb376'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'With the success of One Punch Man, everyone was looking forward to the next ONE adaptation Mob Psycho 100. As it finally aired, it was initially met with mixed reactions. Maybe people set the bar too high and were met with a slight disappointment. However, I personally saw the show’s potential and patiently witnessed the show progress which turned into a quite satisfying experience.\\nThe show follows the story of Kageyama Shou a.k.a Mob who tries to avoid using his psychic powers with the intention of hurting others. He looks up to his master Reigen Arataka said who is actually a clever swindler that I personally\\ncan’t help liking because of his smooth nature. While Reigen often lacks screen time, focusing more on Mob’s part of the story, they are the two core characters of the show. Other characters of interest include the cheeky spirit Dimple, the stylish Hanazawa who is another esper, and Mob’s caring brother Ritsu. There are other interesting attention-grabbing characters present but the three of them have more significance due to their own story arcs. The overall approach of the story seems to gravitate towards a parody-styled zany comedy while trying to satirize the idea of possessing supernatural powers. The action is fast-paced and explosive. Shot and often manoeuvred at different insane angles, one can’t help but be amazed despite that the animation is not as top-notch as OPM. The art looks rough and cartoony, but it fits the atmosphere well. There are elements of coming-of-age and drama present as it shows Mob’s struggle of possessing psychic powers as he grows up. The dramatic effect is not too overblown and is just restricted to internal monologue but it does provide a good edge on presenting the conflict within the main protagonist.\\nIf there is one issue I have with the show, it is the direction of the story.  It started cool with introducing to us the everyday life of a boy with psychic powers working part-time for a scam business which I find really interesting. However, it would’ve been great to see if Mob finally discovered or realized that Reigen is a fake supernatural expert. The story finds a way to solve that problem later on but it would have been a nice good character development if it went toward that path. As mentioned earlier, there are character arcs in the story where Mob finds himself involved in some way. Though I enjoyed all of them, one in particular sort of bothered me which was Ritsu’s arc. I felt like the show has put way more time than necessary for it. It does try to develop Ritsu’s character, but all the time I was thinking that Mob could have used that development more since he is the more important and interesting character. Mob was still struggling with conflicted feelings about using psychic powers when it was revealed that there’s a villain organization. Basically, I liked that the show tries to take its story more seriously and not devolve into a redundant punch-line comedy. However, I feel like it doesn’t want to harm the comedic nature of the show thus always choosing the easy way out of a conflict. It’s a shame really, but maybe we can get more action if we can get a sequel.\\nOverall Mob Psycho 100 is a refreshing approach to action comedy, not too exaggerated and not too mediocre. Don’t expect another One Punch Man, it’s a show that can stand on its own without being associated to the author’s more successful endeavor.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e5126d81be64256f7a6b1635d91d70e5'}>,\n",
